0,"What even is Tsukasa's criteria to revive people? Those brutes don't seem like the kind of people he would want in his ideal world.    It's like he went looking for the biggest, meanest looking statues he could find...and Gen.      ""He claims to be opposed to people desiring power, but he revived a corrupt police officer and a member of the military who turned out to be a nice guy but still.""     ""He also claimed to want a world without adults, but I doubt a minor can be a police officer, or a sonar specialist, or a reporter.""",1
1,"I mean, it isn't like Dr. Stone doesn't have plotholes and such.     ""Like the astronaut graveyards being in Senku village when the Island was actually the place they landed on and Ishigami village is an offshoot - remember that the Soyuz itself is on the island.""    As for the others with ""special skills"", almost all the major characters in the series are exceptionally talented and prodigies in some way. This is basically a Danganronpa spinoff.",1
2,"I don't think that's a plot hole, since the 100 stories told the villagers that they should go to Japan, they probably also said to take the gravestones with them  ""since Byakuya's grave contained a message for Senku, and one of the stories hints at how to access it.""",0
3,"Wow, if Reddit is reacting this way about the swords, I can't wait to see how they react to  ""tank.""",1

5,How much do you guys think the anime will cover as a whole? End of volume 8?,2
6,"Gen is quickly becoming one of my favorite characters. Looks like he's gonna stick to kingdom of science for good now, looking forward to more interactions between him and Senku.",1
7,"""Give me cola or I rat you out""",2
8,Senku:,2
9,"     ""Rat me out and no more cola!""",0
10,"     ""I can live without cola. You can't live without your life.""",2
11,Thats why Senku should start making original cola to get Gen hooked,1
12,So Senku starts peddling drugs?    Sounds like my Rimworld colony.,1
13,Smh Senku should've turned Tsukasa's readers into hats...,0
14,"But he's also the one guy who knows how to make antibiotics, so Senku automatically wins all negotiations.",1
15,"is that why ""People die when they are killed""",0
16,"Jokes on you, I haven't had a life for years!",1
17,D:,1
18,NANI!,2
19,"     I mean, where else is he going to get his cola from?",2
20,"As someone who was heavily addicted to soda for too long I can relate hard to his priorities, can you even imagine that first sip after 2,000 years.",0
21,Just hook it to my veins!,2
22,You don't get between a man and his bottle of cola.,2
23,Gen's great. He's basically the people-person that helps Senku get the gears moving whenever human factors get in the way.,1
24,"Yeah, I like how in the ridiculous over-the-top manner of this manga everyone's super-specialised and absurdly extreme competence complements each other's, and Gen is basically a condensate of so-called ""soft skills"" - psychology, communication, all that jazz. And of course he's as important to success as science or craftsmanship.",1
25,Like he wasn’t a favourite of yours well before this EP smh ; Cola mentalist needs more screen time XD,1
26,He has no choice at this point. Honestly the second they got to the village and saw senku they should have killed him on the spot.,0
27,"Yes man this show is actually fucking top notch and Gen finally fully embracing Kingdom of Science was SO FUCKING HYPE. I am actually going to hold on reading this manga because the animation, sound track and voice acting just brings me tears of joy or sadness EVERY fucking episode. This show is actually such a fucking treasure to behold, so glad I decided to watch it.",1
28,"He's great. He's smart, not a genius of course, but still has his own style of wits.",1
29,besides senku gen is my favorite character,1
30,I relate to him on a mentale level.,2
31,This show went from medicine to warfare Really quick,0
32,Factions who are gunning for a Science Victory should never be given a moment of peace.,1
33, ,2
34,...mongrel,2
35,The secret is to Ally Gilga in the very beginning by bribing him with your early diplomacy points. Once he's a friend he is very loyal.,1
36,look away for one minute and tthey have bomber planes hitting your muskiteers,2
37,Next thing you know your Great War infantry are fighting giant death robots and XCOM squads.,0
38,They flying into space and I don't have a single bit of oil in my lands.,2
39,"Lol, reminds me one time I played this massive game of Civ I think it was IV or V..., and I conquered my whole continent, advanced to at least WW2 level of technology, and was looking forward to the challenge as there was a whole other continent that I still had not explored or really interacted with.     So I consolidate my economy at home, I ready myself for war, I send the fleets... and I find some backwards empire still barely out of the iron age somehow had managed to unify the whole thing. I swept them away in a handful of turns with no resistance and just a small advance force. It was pretty much like Saitama feels all the time I guess.",1
40,Facts,2
41,Si science is OP got it,2
42,And I love it. They have built up such a great world,1
43,I like how the first people that Tsukasa choose to revive were goons from  Hokuto       smugtouru,1
44,"""Not adults""    Most ripped """"""""""""teenagers"""""""""""""" in the history of ever lol",1
45,Wait thats not how your average teenager is looking?,2
46,where is that anime chart that makes fun of this troupes with age and muscle characters...,1
47,Is this a motherfucking  reference!?,0
48,"I was like, how TF did Tsukasa find these goons? Like, did he hit up the area where the local gym used to be and de-petrify every musclehead there?",1
49,"That would be my guess, he'd know where a lot of the best gyms and dojos were and so would the people he revived, it wouldn't be that hard to find strong people but obviously it's highly exaggerated in the show.",1
50,"He hit up the local IFBB competition, these dudes are like 350lbs of muscle.",1
51,there's a guy you'll meet later in the series that helps him with that.,1
52,How they passed Tsukasa's criteria,2
53,You smell like beer,1
54,Dr. Stone is set in JoJoverse confirmed.    And petrification is the work of an enemy Stand.,0
55,I think that was confirmed with Tsukasa the Pillar Man lol,1
56,This is actually the prelog to the Pillar Men,2
57,   AYAYAYAYAAAA intensifies   ,2
58,I'm just an average 16 year old high school student.,2
59,"I think they are actually adults. Tsukasa probably revived them as his pawns to get rid of afterwards. He killed lion with one punch so he can kill them easily. He probably doesn't need that many teenagers right now since they are not strong. Once he estabilishes everything and removes threat such as Senku, he will then revive them and get rid of his adult musclebrains.",0
60,"     Not adults as in ""30+ years old"". He has not problem with people up to 30 or so, more and it probably gets difficult.",0
61,"I dunno if that's from the manga or what, but in the anime he said he just didn't like adults.",0
62,"It sounded more like his perception of ""adults"" were those who orchestrated and maintained the status quo.",1
63,"Once you start seeing who he revived it's made clear some of them  can't  be younger than 20. Though I think he says something closer to ""old people"" than ""adults"". he mostly hates middle aged people and up from what I've seen.",0
64,straight out of Sakigake!! Otokojuku,1
65,Motherfucker you look 30,0
66,"It's probably high school delinquents, as anime teaches us those are usually endowed with supernatural strength.",1
67,oh yeah this guys are at least 30 lol..not teenagers at all,1
68,"In my eyes it has more of ""Lord of the Flies"" also a Book",2
69,"Either these are some super buff 14 year olds, or I missed the part where the guy went back on his plan to never revive any adults.",1
70,"I kind of wish Tsukasa wasn't in the story or at least dealt with early on. I think a story where they just focus on civilization building would have been amazing enough with advancements like electric, glasses, and medicine.    Tsukasa just adds unnecessary stress to the story.     But...to be fair kicking caveman ass with katanas is pretty awesome. All the strongest villagers wielding swords against a team of goons felt like an RPG party!",1
71,it's the natural progression of things really,1
72,Like a game of Civ? But honestly even in this fictional show war is inevitable between an aggressor and a nation trying to go for a science victory lol.,1
73,"More like, 17 episodes too quickly.",1
74,you mean a pillow fight with extra steps?    with an appointment for next pillow fight cuz...clearly    and that is bad,0
75,"Unfortunately. I don't like the fighting that much, I would rather prefer them to peacefully Simcity their way to civilization.",1
76,"Medicine IS warfare.    an army back in ancient days with antibiotics would have been unstoppable, because they could return more wounded to the front, faster.",0
77,Senku playing Age of Empires while Tsukasa playing Street Fighter. Gen got most of the good artwork this episode,1
78,"Tsukasa's still in the Ancient Era man, he gotta boost his science per turn or Senku's Kingdom gonna steamroll his ass mid-late game",0
79,"The problem is, that while Senku doesn't seem to lack ressources, he does not have enough settlers to advance into the next era. He really needs to expand the village and maybe create a new one to make sure to not run into difficulties with ressource supply in the later stages.",1
80,"He does have a really good starting location for turtling though, especially since his opponent is going wide but not building up an infrastructure so Senku isn't getting punished for going tall.",1
81,"If you haven't realised, all his important industrial buildings as well as his barracks are located outside of the settlement. And while they have a guarding tower, it is not sufficient and makes them vulnerable to hostile attacks. He needs to fortify those or he will lose all his advantages",0
82,It's fine because his enemy is too dumb to pillage his territory.,0
83,No need ro take risks IMO,0
84,"They can't make use of it, but pillaging? I think that's their first instinct.    ""Hey, what's with all this NERD stuff, you forgot a lab here, NERD? Oops, I knocked that strange bottle to the ground and it broke, you lookin' for it, NEEERD? Too bad if I were to bash open this whole weird oven looking thing, yes?""",0
85,     Not really though? I mean they could have spent the entire night the village was partying to completely mess up the place but didn't.,2
86,Thats what we call plot armor,2
87,I love how accurate AoE is to reality.,1
88,"Yep, just get me 50 bowls of ramen and I'll make a full grown human for you.       sshhh haa ",1
89,Or Senku could just go around de-petrifying more people to build the village.,2
90,It's a mission campaign. Tsukasa is the only one who can convert gaia villagers.,2
91,But Senku did Wololo Gen didn't he? Or he gave him Cola so I guess Cololo? Anyway the play should be to convert Tsukasas men. You get brainy humans and give them tech upgrades.,1
92,It's on cooldown.,2
93,"Both of them are playing a One-City challenge, however.",1
94,"I mean, Senku needs to increase population for more than one city. A certain gorilla could help him with that.",1
95,"He and Gen are instrumental to adding some more genetic diversity, that's for sure. It's a marvel that the town managed to survive being so inbred.",1
96,"Don't count Tsukasa out just yet.  With his focus on traditional martial arts, he could easily find master archers who can outclass flintlock muskets.  Muskets that Senku hasn't even finished yet.    A 100 pound draw bow with an experienced user is going to outclass someone using a musket.  Senku would need rifles and steel armor to stand a chance.",1
97,or u know go fuck morals next time they show up im gonna use chemical weapons,0
98,I know that would be effective.      But I was nervous watching Senku and the group mining sulfur in range of the deadly gas.  I don't think Senku is in a hurry to work with deadly gases like mustard gas again.,1
99,Chemical weapons aren't really that useful outside dealing with mass formations. Neither side has enough people for that.,0
100,"100 pound draw bow? He would need to find craftsmen, or at minimum 1 craftsman for that. Finding one by reviving people at random and questioning them to figure out where is the best location   to look for one would take a while it's been a long time, but we can assume Tsukasa doesn't start this plan until he is sure Senku is alive. Senku's village has a few weeks at the least to prepare for that eventuality",1
101,I mean it‘s a war between science and military but at the same time also Quality and Quantity. Everyone knows that Quality overrules Quantity. Well on a next step you may argue that Material is higher rated than Skill and this is literally the only thing that bugs me. Normally Skill should win over Marerial strenght,1
102,"I think Tsukasa's idea is a momentum game: take Senku out  before  that midgame even starts. A viable strategy, given how close Senku's capital is to his, and given that, so far as anybody knows, this is a 2 player game.",2
103,WE NEED MORE SETTLERS     Town Center clicking noises      home building noises      vanishing food noises ,2
104,You said it.    Cautious Hero has some good Rista reaction faces too but Dr. Stone is in a whole another league,1
105,Tsukasa is me when playing civilization...      I just upgraded to bowmen on chariots and Senku has laser rifles . . .,1
106,"Game idea: a strategy game about two dojos fighting, their troops are martial artists and whenever two meet you enter battle mode in which you control your man in a fighting game interface and determine the outcome.",0
107,Battle Realms,0
108,Loving Gen's character.,1
109,BLADES OF SCIENCE!,2
110,Those primitive gaijin folded over 1000 times!     head-tilt,2
111,     Or twice in this case... but that doesn't sound as awesome even though it technically is.,0
112,"     Those are rookie numbers, you gotta fold them at least 1 billion times",2
113,Everything is 10 billion,2
114,"So, glorious nippon steel, folded over 1  000   time  s  .",1
115,"I do recall hearing extra folds was wasted but I don't recall if the structure after 2 folds was identical to like 10. Still, very happy the show skipped some steps indicating a preference to science over tradition.",1
116,The folding was completely because Japan had absolutely shit steeliron. They did tons of research in order to figure out how to actually make steel weapons that wouldn't just shatter. The heavy impurities make the steel brittle and of inconsistent quality. The folding evenly distributes all the impurities throughout the material and makes it more consistent. If you have non-shit steel like the Europeans then you don't need to fold it.,0
117,"Well, folding it twice would give it 4 layers. 3 folds would be 8 layers and so on. So its just 10 folds like he said in the show to get 1024 layers.",1
118,It is amusing because the inhabitants of Ishigami village only have 1 Japanese ancestor with the other 5 being Russians and Americans.    Meanwhile all of the other side is pure Japanese.,1
119,Funny they all ended up exclusively speaking Japanese when all astronauts have to know English  and  Russian to board the ISS. There'd be a real communications issue today if they hadn't lost 46 adults leaving Ishigami all the kids to take care of and write Japanese stories for.,1
120,"Even if they ended speaking Japanese, it is impossible that after thousand of years the language is still intelligible with his ancestor and they can communicate with Senku. Languages change a lot after all that generations.",1
121,"In an older episode discussion a few weeks ago, someone pointed out that English from thousands of years ago is still pretty intelligible to us, so it's not that far fetched. The biggest problem is that the village is so small that language would probably evolve much much quicker than in an established civilization like great britain. Still, it's within the realm of possibility, so Dr Stone is going to roll with it, which I can appreciate",1
122,"Two thousands years ago English didn't exist. It was Proto-Germanic, a language completely unintelligible to their modern descendants English, German, Dutch, Scandinavian languages, etc    Even Old English like Beowulf before Norman conquest in 1066 is unintelligible with modern English. And it is only one thousand years old.    And you are right that languages can evolve slowly in a isolated village. But the frametime is so big 3700 years that it is impossible that the language is similar at all or that they can communicate.",2
123,"English became intelligible around the time of the Renaissance when the great vowel shift occurred.  A hundred years before it would be slightly intelligible with serious concentration if you were familiar with how the language was before the vowel shift.  Before that you would be lucky if you understood any of the language.  Keep in mind that this is   600 years ago that there was a dramatic shift in the English language.  So it would be a smaller than 10 billion to 1 chance that Senkuu would come across people that were descended from the astronauts of the ISS that spoke an intelligible language to Senkuu.  Especially when you take into consideration the first generation were probably taught Russian, and English as well as Japanese when they were growing up.",1
124,"Remember that Byakuya was the one teaching the stories and he found it too difficult to taught in English, then by the moment he died, the survivors didn't even know how to write his name on his grave.    So they speak Japanese and only have an oral tradition.    In the end they managed by being a village of children, is crazy.",0
125,The other nationalities died off a bit soon. Leaving the Japanese teacher behind,0
126,   BANZAI INTENSIFIES  ,2
127,Even Magma started posing with the katana.  Weebs of Science Wallpaper.       umucool,2
128,lmfao ginro just looks like a Quincy,1
129,"Maybe I'm wrong, but I can definitely see Magma having a satisfying redemption in the series",1
130,Ahh such a glorious warthunder refernce,1
131,     fixed.,2
132,"And very real, not fake at all guns!",1
133,"They already have glass, Senku should invent lasguns and roleplay as the Emperor of Mankind. Tsukasa's guys can't fight without being blinded.",1
134,Why stop at blinding them? Make an Archimedes heat ray.,0
135,"     Mythbusters tried to replicate that and it wasn't hot enough to even light something on fire. Basically it could be used to dazzle people and make them go ""ouch that's hot"" but that's about it.",0
136,But are Tsukasa's gang the sort that watch Mythbusters?  You just have to convince them you have a death ray.,0
137,I remember that level in Age of Empires 1. It scared me when I was little because my ships would instantly get blown up by 100 attack towers.,0
138,Totally read that as lasagna at first.,2
139,"No, he meant lasagna.  He's going to win hearts and minds with pasta just like before.",1
140,Whole reason he wants to get to space is to create the Mechanicum on Mars.,1
141,Thanks to Man at Arms they forged my little knowledge in making swords and blacksmithing in general.,1
142,"I thought they ceased all production, but it looks like they came back but not nearly as active as before.",1
143,"Iirc the owners of the Awe Me channel went bankrupt, but it eventually got bought so MaA came back. In the meantime, the team put up a smithing channel that's more about technique, which still gets content every once in a while.",0
144,That’s cool. Is Ilya still there?,1
145,Ginro is the only one who didnt make a clean cut using the Katana. It shows his skill level compared to the other village fighters,0
146,"Kagaku no Yaiba, where Tanjiro at tho?",0
147,I'm surprised the world wasn't already a stone world before the stoneffication. Japan was already full of fucking cavemen.,1
148,"Tsukasa has a huge hate-boner for adults, so, I guess, apparently those cavemen are kids? Japan has some terrifying children...",0
149,what the hell are japanese children eating this days?,0
150,Probably weaker children. The Japanese just want us to think they have low birth rates,0
151,"Or maybe Tsukasa made a gym with a name ""Become a gorilla or die"".",2
152,Or he is only reviving people with an visible abs and goes from there            He literally is in a reverse Gaccha position where he can check everyone he wants on his team,2
153,"Visible abs only selects for low body fat percentage though, not really strength. If strength is what you're after, you'd ideally find people who are built like bears. No abs but they certainly pack a punch.",1
154,Ok true enough      Point still being you can gauge their physical ability before reviving,1
155,"That is true. Also if you're looking for good warriors you probably want someone with good fighting skills, so someone with background in things like boxingmartial artsfencing and so on, and the people in those sports do have a different physique than strongmen. Downside of course is that anyone with that kind of background aren't likely to actually join his army because when you do a sport where you get taught skills that can be used to hurt someone, they also make darn sure to drill it into you that you should never actually do so unless your life depends on it.    What he actually wants to look for is simple though. Since he needs someone who both seems like they can fight and is willing to do so, he should just be on the lookout for anyone who looks like a common street thug.",1
156,"Strong enough to fight, dumb enough to command",0
157,"I mean, the idea is Tsukasa is so OP that in this stone world he is literally a 1 man army himself right? So even these people who know how to fight, like black masked dude, even if he has that kind of moral code, Tsukasa will kick his ass and go ""See you are fighting because your life is on the line after all""    In a world where there is no law, and if he murders you there is no punishment, I think that would sway all but the most honestly moral people.",0
158,That right dudes biceps weights as much as my whole body holy shit,0
159,Is that picture from gay porn?,2
160,"Possibly, though I found it on a bodybuilding forum. Then again that's practically the same thing.",2
161,"No one told them that ""A Modest Proposal"" is supposed to be satire...",0
162,"There are no  low birth rates, but japanese children are forced to fight to the death since they are old enough to walk. It is a constant fight for survival and those cavemen are the result of it.",0
163,Sure we only have 1.4 kids per woman       But those kids count as 3-4 for yours!,1
164,Iron. As in ingots,2
165,Look like typical Japanese anime high school thugs to me,1
166, muffled KURRRRAAAAAA in the distance ,2
167,No,0
168,No wonder their birth rates are so low. These guys probably tear out of their mothers like xenomorphs.,0
169,what an image,2
170,Reminds me of characters from Eyeshield 21. Even the voice actors sounds the same,2
171,"Probably not a coincidence, the writer for Dr. Stone was also the writer for Eyeshield 21.",2
172,"Oh wow, did not expect that.",1
173,The other reply isn't loading for me so someone might have already said this but the author for Dr. Stone not artist is the same as for Eyeshield 21.,2
174,GAOH SAMA,2
175,The one who always farts,2
176,"It always seemed to me like his thing against ""adults"" wasn't literally saying that people are no good after they graduate high school. He doesn't like the older generations who were well-off and held power in the old world and would want it back. A millennialgen z vs. boomers argument, basically. He wouldn't have a problem with 20-somethings only a few years older than himself.",1
177,"But in the end though, you have to admit that those generation were just lazy though looking at the current state of the world.",0
178,Either that or they're adults he keeps around as disposable soldiers,2
179,he is the ultimate millennium boomers killer,0
180,TBF Mahesh . IE shorter people look way more jacked than their taller counterparts.,2
181,They're middle school students.,2
182,Tsukasa is the kind of guy to say “ok boomer”,2
183,"They're just really enthusiastic Fist of the North Star cosplayers.     Seriously speaking, I think Tsukasa specifically sought out the statues of rough-looking people as a pragmatic move; the best way to have superior military might without having to resort to 'weapons of science'.",1
184,"That was my inpression as well when I first read the manga.  ""Most"" if his revived are FONS thugs.",1
185,I don't get how it seems like NO ONE that Tsukasa revives wants to rebuild civilization. Like they're okay with just being cavemen.,1
186,"Were talking about Tsukasa who smashes people's face in just because they're adults, and was 95% fine with murdering Senkuu. You think he wouldn't just murder anyone who seems to oppose his goal?    Not to mention the dude can fucking one punch lions, would you like to oppose that in a world with no one there to help you? And no hospitals for when you inevitably get your guts smashed?",1
187,"I can see people following him because of fear initially, but these people all were born in the modern era. Tsukasa dream sounds nice but all of these people will get sick of it quite quickly and want to make things advanced as soon as possible. In time Tsukasa dream will fall apart anyway, hes just a narcissist who will murder people so he can live his dream for a few years.",0
188,I was under the impression only people with very strong wills have continuity to their pre-stone persona. These guys don't look like they'd pass,1
189,"No, Only those with strong wills were able to stay conscious while petrified, once freed you still have your memories and personality.",1
190,"Even if they didn't want to rebuild, he's set up the perfect situation for someone to murder him and take over.  With a bunch of people who only value strength, some will definitely want to be the one on top.  And even a lion puncher needs to sleep.",1
191,"Senku: Join me, I'll give you a cola.  Tsukasa Empire minus Tsukasa: I love science.",1
192,Wouldn't he also just die to disease eventually? Senku can just turtle up.,0
193,There´s always the option of leaving for lands further away. I assume the rest of the japanese landmass is still there.,2
194,There might have been. But he'd probably treat them the same way he treated the other guy who chose science.,1
195,"does not make sense and would not pan out the way its describe here, ""IRL""...",2
196,"I dont understand  what you're saying. Who brought up ""IRL""?",2
197,"alright, here is the long version of what i was trying to say:    Let us assume this actually happened ""IRL"" its in quotes because it never will, and let us assume there is a divide just like in the anime, between the science fanatics lets be honest and the brute force guys, the ""cavemen"", if you will.    Since the IQ distribution of the humans throughout the world is normal, in other words, there are no concentrations of scientists in one area and concentration of cavemen in another area, turning someone back from stone gives you a random chance of getting a ""scientist"" or a ""cavemen"".  Our civilization is so advanced at the moment, that our dumbest people are WAY above what we see in the anime portrayed as cavemen.    Perhaps this is still too hard to understand, I am not the best at describing stuff. Let me try it this way:    If the antagonist revived random people, there is a 5050 chance to get either. You might be reviving someone that has a PhD in some field, you might also be reviving a construction worker. You can not know. Appearances can be deceiving, you can have a muscular PhD cuz he works out and a slim construction worker, you can't judge visually.    It is impossible for the antagonist's side to consist of merely brutes, cavemen, idiots. He is bound to have a normal distribution among his group, IQ is afterall normally distributed. He may even have a couple of geniuses that far surpass the protagonist of the show. Because of this saying ""there is always a bigger fish"", which I find is true.    This partition into groups you could label ""science"" vs ""cavemen"" makes no sense whatsoever.  The only argument I heard trying to defend it, was that the antagonist suppressed the intelligent guys on his side. But thats the thing in society, the smart people win. Brute force does not allow you to win the game of society. Politics does, talking, thinking, lying, deceiving. Those are the tools that allow you to climb to the top in a group setting.    You said this:       Let us assume this was so - then in his group, there would form a secret society that gather together and form their own agenda, to overthrow him. His side can not last.    The author was lazy to address this issue...",1
198," you're completely ignoring the fact that while iq is normalized, Tsukasa only resurrects teenagers. What kind of teenagers do you expect to be phds? Honestly I think you're just nitpicking the story and it's not even true nitpicking. It's just not understanding what's happening. I think the chance you find a PhD of all people amongst teenagers is astronomically low compared to finding Meatheads. He's gonna kill any kids that have a dedication to science and he's certainly not resurrecting any scientists when everyone is 18years old or younger. Isnt it actually pretty realistic that in a stone world where you only bring back impressionable teenagers that don't support science you'd end up with a civilization of people who aren't interested in rebuilding society?",0
199,"     You are missing the point. The point is being a genius. There are child geniuses, forget teenager!              I think you are delusional... cuz those meatheads look adult to me! Also lets not forget that the protagonist is a teenager...         Smart guys wont reveal that... age does not matter, if a 12 year old posseses an IQ of 200+, he will know how to circumvent the situation... he will look and see the situation he is in, adapt what he is gonna say which will ideologically align with what is perceived as the norm...",0
200,"Child geniuses aren't magical. All a child genius is is a kid with the potential to learn, and maybe one day apply that knowledge in ways no one else can. Child geniuses aren't magically attuned to the knowledge of science. They wouldn't even be close to a PhD. And also, I'll reiterate that the chance you pick out a child genius is astronomically low compared to picking out a normal kid. It'd actually be easier, and more dangerous for tsukasa, to resurrect adults. Because there's a greater chance they are geniuses.    I don't know if you know but while iq is normalized, it actually does show growth with age. Your iq isn't a static genetic feature. In fact the average iq of children is significantly lower than adults. So again your problem fallls apart because you're relying on this normalized curve to make it an equal chance you grab a genius or a Meathead, but with kids it's skewed. You're more likely to get a Meathead and even the ""geniuses"" don't know that much, they typically just have potential to learn a lot due to their genius.    And the Meatheads aren't adults. I don't know how you figure that. Like are you even listening to the story or do you just go off the visual representation of everything. Tsukasa's whole philosophy is adults are corrupted. He breaks their statues, he stated he wants a new world only of kids because kids are untainted. Those cavemen are literal teenagers. I mean ffs Tsukasa is a higher schooler, does he look like a teenager to you? Or are you also in denial over that and think he's an adult     And a 12 year old with a high iq again isn't magical. They don't pop out of the stone form like senku and have a grasp on everything. They aren't gonna immediately be like ""ah shit I'm definitely dead if I show any interest in science"". Like wtf.    All your problems with the story are from your own skewed perspective of both it and reality when it comes to intelligence. Intelligence isn't magical, a kid genius isn't going to be able to grasp much after 3k years. The chance you even find a kid genius compared to a typical kid is super unlikely, less than trying to find an adult genius. And lastly, yes. Those cavemen are canonically teenagers lol. You're also conflating intelligence with experience and wisdom quite a bit. Reading human behavior has a lot more to do with that than your IQ. Wisdom is what would be required to realize you should hide your interest in science or you might die.",1
201,"sigh.. alright, whatever.    this time around, you got caught up in child geniuses and are missing the point, again... i give up",0
202,"No I didn't, your point is that there are child geniuses he could res, that apparently the Meatheads aren't teenagers, and that it'd be easy enough for a child genius to just pretend they aren't interested in science so they won't be killed, am I wrong? That was your whole comment. How can I misunderstand your 3 points when your comment only had 3 responses in it.",0
203,"     no it isnt... and it is not even that he could res adult phd holders...  the point is that there are smart people everywhere, in any type of category you can come up with, whether child, teenager or adult. you get hung up on the categories and forget all about what im saying.    so what if he does not res adults.  lets go with just teenagers even if I dont agree; those meatheads look 100% adult to me.  amongst teenagers there are thoes that are smart and then those that are stupid. IQ is normally distributed throughout.    So when he resurrected 100 ""teenagers""; he is bound to have 80% avg IQ teens, 8% idiots, 8% smartasses, 2% absolute retards & 2% geniuses.    Perhaps not a genius on an adult level.  But who cares, if they are all teenager anyway, a genius teenager among teenagers is still the epitome of intelligence. why get caught up in age??    UGH    as such, the likelihood of him reviving someone just like the protagonist, is high whether by accident or not, is irrelevant.    heck it does not even have to be a genius, the top 0.1%, it can be the top 10%. or top 5%.    they will conspire together. thats how it would pan out IRL.    a genius teenager is able to outsmart a stupid or avg. teenager, by definition, cause he is smarter.    Edit: and because of this, it makes no sense whatsoever to have a concentration of meatheads on one side and concentration of ""scientists"" on the other side.  The ""science"" side does not even consist of purely scientists, they too have a lot of meatheads! This just proves that the meathead side must likewise have ""scientists"" or simply smart teens, pls dont get caught up in that shit again.    But in the show, they dont. Thats a discrepancy. Thats why it makes no sense. THAT is why the initial comment which this reply-chain leads up to, is right. Which is     ",0
204,"     So your point is there are child geniuses he could res? He's certainly not gonna resurrect a genius from any other of those categories. He only resurrects kids and teenagers.            But who cares, if they are all teenager anyway, a genius teenager among teenagers is still the epitome of intelligence. why get caught up in age??    Because you're saying ""irl there's no way Tsukasa could have a society of Meatheads"". Well, if the average kid is an idiot and also impressionable, it isn't hard to imagine how you kill off the ones who like science and still maintain plenty more that don't like science. This isn't about ""can x outhink y"". Its about ""how plausible is it to build a population entirely of kids who are against science"". Since most kids are impressionable, don't understand science, and arent the epitome of intelligence, it's pretty plausible  because they are kids . That's why the category matters. If it was adults it would be less plausible. With adults you really do have an equally likely chance of getting these cavemen who don't support science and geniuses who have phds. The average adult also will not be so polarized as to be entirely against science. You don't want to get caught up in categories, but categories is everything here. Because the people Tsukasa brings back to life,  belong to a certain category that makes this scenario plausible . There aren't enough kids mature or smart enough on average to start a splinter group powerful enough to overthrow a group full of cavemen.            ??? How does this connect. Even if you picked a genius kid, one of those 2% you mention that is equivalent to the 2% of cavemen, you realize they'd be nothing like Senku still. Senku is fucking insane. Hed probably be the smartest person in the world even in the modern day. The chance of finding another PERSON like him, letalone a kid, is impossible basically.    Now if you lower the bar to like top 5 or 10 you could end up with kids like that. But again intelligence isn't going to make them magically able to deduce they will be killed for supporting science. Tsukasa will cull them.    Or you know, theres also the fact there is conspiring. Gen was literally resd by Tsukasa and low and behold he's conspiring. Does he not fit your tastes?           I don't know what to say this is such horrible logic. Senkus side could give less shits if you're a scientist or a Meathead. That's why they are the protags. Tsukasa's side is the one persecuting a type of people scientists, not senku. So obviously Senkus side has people from both sides whereas Tsukasa does not.     The people Tsukasa revives do not want to rebuild civilization because they are kids. Keep talking about how categorization doesn't matter, but kids are fundamentally easier to manipulate and are less reasonable. It would be no massive task to build a civilization of teenagers who think the old society was bad and science was evil.",1
205,"I mean, he has harems.",2
206,"To be fair, I think you could eradicate the whole Tsukasa subplot from the story and it would not be worse off. Maybe less shonen.",1
207,"I mean, only a mere handful of members of the empire have had screen time so far in the anime...    Many of his people probably wouldn't even suspect rebuilding civilisation to even be  possible  in their lifetime. Thus, why try?",1
208,Gen wants to rebuild civilization.,2
209,"It's actually hilarious how fucking flimsy tsukasa whole plan is lmao, your telling me u revive someone and they see that the whole world has become like this and they wouldn't join up with senku after seeing him once lol. Like a character has to be brain dead to actually follow tsukasa lol.",1
210,Suppose you're a dumb musclehead. You can be an officer in Tsukasa's primitive army... or low level labour pumping oxygen in a furnace or something else like it in the Science Kingdom. What's your pick? Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.,0
211,He probably just has them killed if they aren't on-board with his plans. Only people like Gen who are sufficiently good liars would be able to get away with it.,0
212,Tsukasa just made sure to revive anyone who he thought might be a fellow Pillar Man first.,1
213,I really want to see Tsukasa and two others standing on a hill looking down at the village,1
214,Wasn’t tsukasa fine with science but he just wanted only the young people to be brought back so they could rule but Senku wanted to revive everyone? Or did I read it wrong,0
215,More strictly; he wanted a world full of young and  strong  people; or people he knew were young and useful at least in the context of an early neolithic idyllic society.,1
216,"Reason I like Dr stone. It's cool. It's exhilarating, it is upbeatoptimistic, focused on fun and not too hardcore. If this show was too emotional i wouldn't be able to take it in with all the shitty ass screams like certain animes. All in all I love it. It keeps me happy and that's all I need",1
217,"It's a great little science romp and if you can look past the kinda disjointed character progression for some of the side characters and the pacing some scenes felt longer than they needed to be, it's a fun show to just kick back and relax to watch",1
218,"I love it too, but part of me wishes it would have just stayed with Senkuu, Taiju and Yuzuriha slowly expanding the world without any of the drama included.    Now there is a part that wishes they would actually just kill people..",0
219,"I like that each ark has a clear short term goal, survival, health, war, otherwise it would seem pretty random to just find project after project and finally building a rocket. Conflicts drives the plot.",1
220,There are plenty of sources of conflict that could be used to drive the story forward without resorting to war and murder.     I don't really like the Tsukasa plot being the focus because its incredibly bizarre compared to any of the more realistic dangers they would be facing in this kind of situation.,0
221,     Probably the worst characters in the entire show. One is just no personality besides helpful maiden and the other just yells a lot and likes the maiden. I like Chrom and the rest a billion times more.,1
222,The manga rating wasn't good when it was only the original trio. It get much better when Senku is separated from them.,1
223,Agreed. The Ishigami gang is way more entertaining than the original trio.,1
224,I hope whatever they’ve got cooking in S2 will go back to that Senku Taiju Yuzurihara dynamic for a bit before it ramps up to wherever the fuck this story will go post Tsukasa war,0
225,Reading Sun-Ken-Rock it's like the bad-assness of that series but hyped up on a kid level,1
226,Omg the hairstyle is almost exactly the same!,2
227,They're by the same artist,2
228,my head cannon is Sun-Ken-Rock is Senku's biological dad :,2
229,So that would mean byakuya changed his hair style to suit his son so they don't look too different? Lel.,2
230,I agree! You just described why I’m so into this show! Happy eps to cheer me up on Fridays is what I need,1
231,"Yup, I love the idea that there's always progress towards a new goal.",1
232,"Well said. It ticks all the boxes of something I’d enjoy built into an incredibly built world  concept. This is easily one of my favorite series of all time, including the manga which I’m starting to read",1
233,Dog-kun saved the day by pointing Suika to all the misplaced flowers,1
234,"We need a full spin off series of Sherlock Suika, just saying",2
235,A Suika x Chika Love Detective show would be awesome            Lets just hope that their combined IQ is over 6,1
236,Chika's actually really smart in other ways. She speaks several languages & is an accomplished pianist. She's also smarter about social situations than the two big brain geniuses.,1
237,But the ending song...        And the memes....,2
238,The fact that Suika rhymes with Chika makes it 10 billion times better,1
239,"Considering how many fucking Sherlock shows we have this season, now would be the time",2
240,His name is Chalk!,2
241,I want a backstory for the puppy,1
242,"Oof, it was probably worth it in the end but losing the spy you had is gonna hurt...",0
243,"They will not lose him as a spy if they kill all the invaders, but I doubt that they will do that. Well, they can still capture them.",0
244,"I don't think they'll just sit around, they'll escape, not enough manpower to track them down before they reach Tsukasa.",1
245,You dont really need to imprison them. Just give them ramen and mention you have electricty.     Im sure theyd change their tune pretty quickly since theyve been living in a cave for 6+ months.,1
246,"We don't know the motivations of the spear guy. It remains to be seen what he'll do. If he joins Senku, Tsukasa knows Senku is alive and his party got wiped out. If he returns and tells the truth, Tsukasa knows. If he returns and lies... it'd need a pretty big lie.",1
247,"I was more thinking the dumb muscle characters. Hygoa or any other ""main"" character Tsukasa has brought back would be a toss up.",0
248,"Well they could just kill him, or have the muscle heads guard him as prisoner. But you know that wont happen since he's a main character.",0
249,"Considering Tsukasa limited his pool of revival candidates to young, strong, nearby people. He can't really guarentee their commitment to his ideology.    Anyone with half a brain would side with the side with guns. I've played that game of Civ. It doesn't end well for the barbarians.",1
250,...i've lost to barbarians before,0
251,My shortest game of Civ2 ever was choosing to build a barracks first instead of the normal warrior and then immediately losing the city to a wandering barbarian.,0
252,"In more specifically talking about not exploring, having modern infantry, then coming across barbarians.",2
253,You'd have to have a hell of a lot of trust in their nature to put that level of faith in their loyalty. More likely is that they'd be a sword through Senku's back the moment he lets them near him.,1
254,And Senku needs to prepare. He’s making it by the skin of his teeth right now.,2
255,"Even if they managed to kill or capture them, Tsukasa would probably become very suspicious of Gen.",0
256,"You are probably right. Although that spear guy didn't, even though he saw him hanging out with Senku.",2
257,Gen was a double agent. No way spear guy knows until it’s too late.,0
258,Doubtful. Tsukasa isnt an idiot. He would notice Gen come back alone and instantly know what was up. There's no way someone could take down tsukasa's number 2 and then let Gen get away. This would also lead to Tsukasa attacking the village directly most likely and he would slaughter everyone there.,0
259,But the thing is: Gen is not a fighter. It's perfectly within reason for him to survive a skirmish since he wouldn't be on the frontlines.,0
260,Basically anyone that could deal with Hyouga would be able to catch Gen as well.,1
261,"Sure, but for that they would need to be aware of him. Like I said, no reason to stand out in the front lines.",1
262,"But this is a shounen, we    know    that somehow they are not going to get executed.",2
263,"You seem to forget that they also have two more spies, Taiju and Yuzuriha",0
264,They stop being spies and turn into hostages the moment Tsukasa learns Senku is alive.,1
265,Yeah that's the first thing that came to my mind. Either they're done for or they double-double-cross and are now aligned with Tsukasa,1
266,"     I can't imagine they'd do that, but that'd be fucking awful",0
267,I can't see Taiju doing that. The backstory episodes with him and Senku warmed my heart.,1
268,And yuzuriha is very much a good girl archetype,1
269,"Oh I certainly have not forgotten about them, they just wouldn't be anywhere near as good at it as Gen.",1
270,Oh yeah remember when they were main characters,1
271,I honestly didn't think much of the show before they split off. I was one episode away from dropping it.,1
272,I thought it was fun but I much prefer the new crew,1
273,Glad that time is gone for a while now.,1
274,Taiju is great I don't get why everyone dislikes him.,1
275,I don't like characters that scream for absolute any reason. The sun has risen? Let's scream about it. The water is wet? Let's scream about it.,0
276,     I mean... People were screaming about that one online for a while,0
277,It's not like Gen is the only who can spy.,0
278,Spy evolved into.. Ambassador!,2
279,That was only going to pay off for so long. And Tsukasa himself is pretty damn smart despite being the King of the Meatheads. It wouldn't take much to figure out the weasel mentalist known for tricking people turned on him.,1
280,"      Yay, finally some hard action and serious business!          But no killing... Blades of science are only for cutting other primitive weapons.     taigasigh",0
281,Yeah when he hit the cavemandude with the spear and broke his nose it weirded me out a little bit...,0
282,"At first I thought that maybe he used the butt of the spear, but that didn't make sense. He had every chance to pierce that guy. And then it hit me... We're on the hippie pacifists side and probably only Tsukasa is going to do the killing.",0
283,Senku is gonna have to invent a chandelier so they can ninja turtles it up by using their sharp weapons to cut the rope and drop it on someone instead of y'know using their sharp weapons to kill the people that are trying to wipe out their whole village and all scientific progress for the rest of time.,0
284,Wait until he builds a piano...,2
285,The Virgin Kingdom of Science vs. The Chad Kingdom of Giorno's Theme,2
286,So they can Looney Tunes it up.,2
287,Yeah..sucks they can’t be realistic and just kill their evil enemies ..like seriously you aren’t gonna persuade all of them to join your side,0
288,"To be fair, Senku greatly benefits from manpower, and rebuilding society as it is is way more appealing to most people than being cavemen forever. Only real weirdos like Tsukasa are actually going to prefer the Stone World, so avoiding killing is pretty likely to pay off. It paid off with Gen after all.     That being said, you're right that it's unlikely that these specific grunts will defect, but it's still not generally good practice to get into the habit of murdering your very recruitable enemies.    There's also the whole moral thing where Senku intends to revive everyone, so the fewer who end up dead the better, etc.",0
289,I'm 1 billion percent sure they are going to just let the villains run off now.,0
290,"Well, of course they will. But not before making friends with them...     smugrose",0
291,"Senku is determined to save as many people as he possibly can. That includes the enemy if possible. Besides, I feel like they've never had to actually kill a human before, so they have hang ups that Tsukasa's rock commies don't.",0
292,I was shocked that Kinro actually got stabbed and bled.,0
293,"I swear that on the first encounter Kinro got hit in the balls with the spear, that was worriesome",0
294,"For all the realistic science stuff, the swordfighting is still very...  shounen     One guy with a spear couldn't possibly survive 3 swords unless he's making a run for it. I doubt even the best spear fighter on earth could barely hold off two swordsmen, not to mention three",1
295,tsukasa beating the fuck out of those lions should've tipped you off that the show is very shounen lol,0
296,"That's still believable, because that was to show that Tsukasa was a verry stronk boy. It can be unrealistic while simultaneously being believable, as long as the show follows it's own rules. When it starts breaking the rules it set up, it loses that believably",0
297,"But they didn't break the rules, going by your logic. If a guy can fucking kill a lion with a punch, then you can have a godlike spearman, and a walking-all-knowlegde-of-mankind, etc. Also no, him one-shotting the lion wasn't ""believable"", but it did get the point across.",0
298,"if Tsukasa can one shot lions bare handed, he can solo the village alone",0
299,     Erm... As opposed to soloing the village with someone else?,2
300,one shotting is a bit of a stretch but he could defnitely knock one unconscious in one hit,2
301,"A human doesn't fight back a pack of Lions, break them down with punches and survive it, period.     If he can punch lions, people with weapons can be fucked up by a single armed opponent.",0
302,assuming tsukasa is at peak human he could kill a male lion specificaly male in one hit assuming he hits one of the 3 weakest points of the lions skull hence very believable.    but i train with the naginata and i will confidently back myself against multiple average swordsman. the avg spearman can't hope to beat them heck i would not expect to win but i sure as hell can drag it out and hold my own. a good speaman uses thrust slashes and strikes in his arsenal the tip isnt the only part of the weapon using every part of the spear will net you just enough versatility to hold you own against multiple swordsman IF you are more skilled then them.    the villagers have no formal training and are essentially self taught i wouldn't expect them to be the best swirdsman out their and compared to an extremely good martial artist like tsukasa or hyuga nad to top it ff that the fights on a narrow bridge which forces 1v1  1v2 at best its very believable,1
303,"He's an expert with the spear while they're completely untrained with swords.  With the reach and speed of a spear, that's pretty doable.  A regular person could do that and this is a world where people punch out lions.",1
304,Did they say that he was an expert? Sounds like a spoiler to me.,1
305,Gen said he was on Tsukasa's level.  And he uses a spear.  So I think we can safely assume he's pretty good with it.,1
306,What were you expecting? They introduced Tsukasa in 2 episodes and he’s has superpowers.,2
307,"Late to the party, but here's something that says otherwise:",1
308,"This show has better justification for that than most. Senku wants to save  everyone , including his current enemies.",1
309,It kinda bothers me that they don't kill the enemies honestly. It is just BS.,1
310,"           It's worse than that. Kimetsu no Yaiba and Chainsaw Man are in the same magazine right now and fully include plenty of fucked up shit.    There are several past WSJ staples that were more violent. Fist of the North Star and DBZ being some examples. Hell, even MHA has had some messed up stuff here and there.",0
311,"You say that, but plenty of people die horrifically in shonen manga.",0
312,"That's the weirdest thing...  One shounen will have tons of people massacred and other shounen will do anything, even the most irrational thing, to save every little scumbag...",0
313,"It depends. One Piece has a lot of mook death but many major characters, including villains, stay alive.     Then you have Jojo, where it would be strange if members of the cast didn't die by the end. More people die in One Piece, but nobody cares about those deaths.",1
314,"Yeah ,when Hyoga main guy or we his name is spear broke the girl had perfect chance to slice his ass in two ! Others as well but they backed up and now this guys are gonna retreat with no losses to fuck em up :D    But oh well show is PG13 i guess",1

318,The dropped katana is suspicious. They might try to dive it to get that but the probability of finding that is real low though.,0
319,Also you'd be swimming near enemy territory.,0
320,They would be literally swimming in enemey territory,2
321,Depends where the current goes,2
322,The dropped katana is 100% going to be used against them. Why drop the katana if magma can just take another one.,0
323,It's fine. Shigure will pick it up next week.,1
324,"My thoughts as well. Though I feel like they mentioned that the water is really deep there or something, so it might just go ignored.",1
325,"     I think he will have to swap sides. Right now, there's nobody in the science camp that can match Tsukasa. Guns would help, but but that requires gunpowder, which Senku is probably already out of.    To be completely honest I have no fucking idea why these bunch of kids don't just swap to the science side already. It's got COLA for fucks sake. What else do you need?",0
326,Also they were doing a lot to set up the fact that he will switch. Talking constantly about how proper they're acting and how useless his goons are.,0

Look at his battle record:    Maul: Has low ground, wins    Dooku: No high ground, loses    Greivous: Has low ground, wins    Vader: Has high ground, wins    Vader rematch: No high ground, loses    Obi-Wan with the highlow ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is   fact  . Had Yoda not denied his request to battle The Senate with typical Jedi arrogance, Obi-Wan could have defeated Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this was designed so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.    Yoda is shorter than virtually every other fighter, which gives him a permanent low-ground disadvantage; however, his saber-fighting style utilizes a flipping-heavy technique in order to negate this weakness for a temporary window. You'll notice that, as he falls from the central podium in The Senate's building, he immediately retreats, knowing that he can never hold the high ground in this duel. You'll notice that, while training Luke, he rides on him like a mount, to gain the educational high ground and accelerate Luke's training.    As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost due to this technique but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived. The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach to combat based in Eastern philosophy on balance, giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. Only the Chosen One can master the spin, as it is their destiny to maintain balance in the universe. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin fell to the dark side and ceased to be the Anakin he knew, who could no longer use his signature trick .    Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three-dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; there is no gravity in space, therefore there is no high or low ground from any frame of reference.    In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, Obi-Wan intentionally sacrifices himself on the Death Star, so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence, thereby giving him the metaphysical high ground.    Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.    In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit which does nothing.    In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Taoist doctrine in order to always invoke his high-ground powers.",0
351,"Yeah when I saw that he immediately went to stand on a post the moment he crossed over to Senku's side I was like ""Gen you absolute chuuni li'l shit"". He's like a cat and I love him     I'd love to see him try to distract the others with fancy magic, and while they're all looking at all the petals he's just scrambling onto the roof in the background. Because there's nothing you can do to convince me he's actually athletic in any way, it's all just an illusion",1
352,It's good to have someone who is able to keep up with Senku mentally.        The everyone else is too dumb to understand trope would get a bit old otherwise.,0
353,Senku still has Taiju & Yuzuriha as double agents.,2
354,I can legitimately see it being a problem where he is a lazy bastard with no skills.,0
355,"""Katanas are the best blades in the world.""      ;    That's a way to trigger European history buffs.",1
356,In the stone world they'd be since Tsukasa's guys don't seem to have armor and katanas are optimized for cutting unarmoredlow armor as I understand it.,1
357,"I guess, but Senku already said they'd be the best weapons in the stone world, not sure why he would repeat it in different words.",1
358,But spears?,2
359,depends on the context a lone spearman will lose to any well trained fighter and is easy to overrun a whole phalanx is almost unbreakable.,1
360,"A well trained fighter with shields.     Spears still have reach and they are facing non armored targets. Unless something happens like in the show spear breaking, a spear should have no problem dealing against a sword in a 1v1 engagement.",1
361,nope i trained with both naginata and kendo once you know the not so secret formula to taking on a spearman strike first at the spear to knock it out of the way then step in its very easy to win 1v1    the spear is a target as well whereas a sword is not a target hence in actuality the swordsmens reach is longer then a spearman.    if a swrodsmen gets close u lose and getting close to a weapon that is very one dimensional spear = thrust 90% f the time is ridiculously easy,1
362,"Training which is limited by rules and not by real world fighting scenarios. The sword wins if it's able to close the distance. With a spear  you don't just mindly thrust towards the abdomen. Arm, legs are still targets to hit with a spear. Unless you have mobility limitations, the spear can always back up.     Spears, both in close formations and individual combat were a more effective weapon, with swords been a back up.     Shields and different levels of armor change the dynamic. That's how the real world behaved.",1
363,Lol the rules we have in practice matches are 2 types.  Tournament rules self explabatory  And  submission rules    The second one is force your opponent to give up and anything goes punch kick elbow drop your weapon if need be groin shots.     Tournament rules actually favors a spear user since you cant just pummel someone with the hilt once ur close so ur offensive options are limited to shoving them back and slashing which gives distance back    Whereas submission rules get in close and pummel them with the hilt knee them in the gut then step back and slash down  Also a spear user pretty much needs to strike first and has to end the match with that one strike if a swordman dodges one thrust the match is over    I watched that HEMA video it was so obvious none of them had any experience against polearms whatsoever they missed soo many opportunities to close out the match and the spear user sucks 2.    Now if we start talking about special polearms like the glaives and warhammers now that shit is real scary to deal with scythes which are incredibly diffcult to use but once mastered your basically unbeatable.,0
364,Both the sword and spear you are refering to have low experience but the spear win so i would say that it was an even match no?    You should watch lindybeige's why spear are better   Also scythe suck ass as an war weapon even if you mastered it compare to the spear,0
365,In war yes scythes fking suck ass also the amount of training needed to get good at one is impossible to acheive for a whole army 1v1 however oh gods they have an answer for everything    Also i have trained extensively in kendo and naginata every kendo student their thats been there for more then 2 years will beat anyone with a naginata no questions asked.    As a war weapon with proper formation 100% spears are better but for small team skirmishes the agility and versatility of a sword wins out cs the reaach of a spear    The real weapon of choice shouldnt even be spear or sword it should be halberds glaives and other more versatile polearms a spear is 2 one dimensional,0
366,Scythe got the +1 intimidation factor but you can't​ thrust with it and it only has 1 sharp side so there's​the disadvantage if the outer side has sharp edge then it might be goood    I think why kendo win against naginata is because lack of experience​ in sparring i rarely ever seen japanese martial artist spar they just stick to showing their froms and such with no real contact but kendo they spar very often i think someo​ne with Yari might do a little better    I agree with the weapon of choice being halberd but that still depends on the situation since it's​ heavier,0
367,scythes are bladed on both sides what makes then truly intimidating is how unpredictable it is and how fucking hard it is to block  evade     everything tells you to block it or step back when its coming at you but that is suicide     also +1 for experience almost no one has experience taking on a scythe and pretty much eery opponent will be taking on a scythe for the first time    naginata actually spar very often at least where i train we have a dual dojo where we do both naginata and kendo i do both,0
368,Yeah but parrying with scythe is pretty fking hard to if you f up then have to defense the charging opponent​,1
369,yeah it gets easier once you face a scythe user a few  times also parrying with the pole is very easy if you f up thats why you need to be a master     its offense is nearly unstoppable,1
370,"Don't know why you're getting downvoted. Spears lose out in a 1v1 because of the predictability of their attacks; only a thrust does damage. The person you replied to talks about backing up but people can't back up as quickly as they can advance. Warhammers frequently had a spike on the top as in the case of a Lucerne Hammer anyway. With glaives and polehammers, you have the ability to use the leverage of the pole to ward off a wide arc with your swings, which is much more threatening than a jab.",0
371,exactly why i am afraid of a glaive and warhammer but am very confident that i can take on many spear oppoents 1v1,1
372,yeah its basically what ive been trying to explain    retreat means nothing because i can chase and a polearm stance is wider and close to the ground for stability another thing that slows them down their steps will be slower that just adds on to the speed difference between retreat and defense.     in naginata training your taught to actually engage when the opponent gets too close and use the polearm as a quaterstaff to strike and force your opponent back the back counterweight doubles as a mass weapon but even then your at a big disadvantage,0
373,"Almost I have watched puts a distinct advantage on the spearman over a swordsman - albeit without shields on either side. I'd love to see your videos of a swordsman beating a SpearYari-user in a 1v1 ""very easily"".",1
374,Next time im at a match ill record myself veating every naginata user back to back,0
375,True.,1
376,"It's not as if a european sword, like a bastard or arming sword wouldn't easily hack through people as well. European Swords were just as sharp as a katana. There is really no advantage to using one.",0
377,Wasn't the katana steel of poorer quality because they didn't have that much iron to work with?,0
378,"Yeah. But it's not like the folding technique is anything special either. Northmen were employing it hundreds of years before the Japanese and european swords also used folded steel.  And even disregarding the quality of the steel, there's no reason to make a sword with one edge when a longsword with a pommel and a strong crossguard is much more useful and applicable to more situations. Especially when they're going up against unarmored opponents with only wooden weapons, meaning the chance for their weapons to break is drastically lowered.    Of course, they shouldn't be using swords as their primary weapons in the first place, but rather continue on with spear weapons, halberds and especially pikes and the like, as those have been proven time and time again to be the most useful weapon in warfare. Plus, the villagers already have experience with using spears as well.     edit: Spelling and grammar",0
379,They explain in the manga that they went for katanas for the intimidation factor as well.,0
380,"Yeah, this was discussed when the manga chapter came out, basically if I'm remembering correctly, all of these people are Japanese, so if they see legit katanas, that are actually made of metal, they'll think, ""Well shit, what do they  not  have""",0
381,"     This is the fine detail here between being great and being just another bad trope. The ""best blades in the world"" scene was really bad in the anime, sadly. A simple ""right now"" at the end could easily have fixed it, without screentime for the intimidation explanation. Which, by the way, is an excellent play on the trope. I'm a bit sad because of how it went. Oh well.    Realistically, they should have gone for spears and crossbows. If they can make Katanas, they could easily make those.",1
382,or just regular bows. against unarmored opponents? cmon senku youre letting me down,2
383,"Eh, maybe he thought that the bow and arrow had too high of a skill difference to use. The stone world people didn’t seem like they had bows to begin with so they would have to train. 3 days is a bit rough to get people proficient in ranged weaponry. Also they had the storm to contend with so I don’t know if they would have trouble with using bows in that kind of environment too.",0
384,"yeah read some other comments about wind conditions and not wanting to give away that firearms were a bluff and it makes more sense    tbh though, 3 days should be plenty to at least get them firing in pretty much the right direction. especially since they dont have to worry about even cloth armor, so hunting bows would be plenty and most of the villagers are gonna be strong enough to fire those effectively",1
385,I actually do a little bit of archery and let me tell you it can be a bitch to learn. The muscle heads of the group might be able to pull off the three days but a regular person would take a while. Pulling a bow at let’s say a 30 pound draw weight will tire you out. Learning how to aim can also be quite hard. Honestly he should invent the compound bow but that might be too hard with their current level of tech.,2
386,"if were gonna assume any level of realism though, these villagers should universally be way more fit than the average modern dude. then again, it is a shounen anime so meh. idk i had high hopes for the series that it would be sorta realistic or believable something in the vein of rational fiction and i feel like its gradually gotten pretty far from that. like a lot of it is good but just, the believability of the world isn't there for me    in the end, if their goal was to kill the invaders which i no longer think it is i think giving 5-10 villagers hunting bows has way more upside than downside. theyre not gonna bullseye 5 arrows a minute for an hour, but you just need a few lucky shots",2
387,"     The show quality takes a dive whenever it goes to classic shonen tropes, sadly. I'm the last person who is unwilling to throw away their suspension of disbelief for realism, sometimes a healthy amount of rule of cool is needed. But it gets a bit too much sometimes.",1
388,this     ;    hitting a human sized target from any distance thats reasonably far away for safety is extremely hard to do consistently did archery for a couple of years when i was young and a moving target hell thats gonna be a nightmare,0
389,"TBH, they had to defend a bridge. Good luck breaking through with a couple of spear in the front and having your back with bows. Heck even stones could work.",1
390,"He’s got iron, just make crossbows and wreck.",0
391,At the end of the day I think Senku is just reluctant to kill. I personally can think of about ten ways he can murder the whole lot of these guys using the items at his disposal. Hell he can grab some acid and just throw it at them. But if he can get them to retreat then that would probably be the best outcome for him. Showing superior firepower might achieve that.,1
392,hitting a human sized target with a bow consistently is very hard let alone a moving target     ;    crossbows suck against numbers because reload time seriously one person needs to get close to a troop of crossbowmen to tear it apart,0
393,"but their village probably has a dozen more people that can use bows who can back up the main fighters. they dont have to be snipers. i wouldnt recommend crossbows, no, they dont make much sense at all here imo",0
394,"Bows require training, you have to build up grip and draw strength, then learn how to put an arrow on target. Crossbows are slow to load, though easier for untrained to shoot.    If he had a few months he could get them up to at least competent at archery, though probably using short bows.    Producing something like an English longbowman requires a shift in society. Need a pool of strong archers to recruit from.    Senku probably wants to skip bowscrossbows and go straight to musketeers. Easier to train, don't have to be physically strong.",1
395,"they dont need to be good with bows, and longbows would be entirely unnecessary for this fight - the enemy doesnt even have clothes let alone a gambison, and the ranges are super short. a super lightweight bow, just something that can wound the enemy, would be fine. im not an archer or anything but ive shot a bow before and...its not  that  hard to be good enough to make a difference in this fight. id still do swords too, but no sense it not doing bows in addition    crossbows are easier to fire, but making them would require much more work, whereas with bows you could get away with just diverting some of the villagers",0
396,Friendly fire is on. An untrained archer firing into melee is more likely to shoot your own troops in the back.    And like 3 untrained archers isn't enough massed fire to be a threat to anyone. Get a dozen and you might be able to pick off 1-2 enemies.,0
397,"yeah. the plan was to arrange all forces on the village side of the bridge. have 5-10 archers probably as many as the village can do firing as the enemy crosses the bridge, with melee fighters arranged in front of the archers to attack at the bottleneck.",0
398,"You've still got untrained archers firing into the backs of friendlies.    About all you can safely do is an opening volley before engagement, and the melee should stand behind the archers.    Senku was on the bridge though, and would have been at risk just as much as the enemy.",1
399,The manga also jerked off katanas but yeah it was for intimidation,0
400,"Something to keep in mind is that Senku made a crossbow already to use against Tsukasa. It didn’t work well, but now Senku can use iron to make a more effective crossbow.",1
401,realistically he could go for chemical weapons but he is not triying to kill them,1
402,It was giving me an error when I posted the first time. I'll delete that.,0
403,Muskets with bayonets is the way to go. Impossible for Tsukasa to counter.,2
404,"Nah, he will just punch them mid air.",0
405,30 muskets firing in formation? I doubt it even by shounen logic.,0
406,He killed a lion in a single punch my dude. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if he could straight up cast yasuo's wind wall by smacking the air around.,0
407,Build a laser and snipe him from behind the wall  Viktor snickers ,2
408,Or just throw a really fucking big bomb at him  laughs maniacally in Ziggs ,0
409,"Have you ever watched a shounen anime? Bullets are probably the most useless of all attacks, unless they are from some magic enchanted or high techy techy weapon.",0
410,i remember dragon ball Super made a point to state that Krillin had been slacking on his training so much that bullets could actually hurt him. so its Cannon as far as shonen go.,1
411,"except a central theme of this show is the power of science, and tsukasa is explicitly afraid of firearms. i would expect that as such, the show would respect firearms. and if it didnt, thatd pretty much ruin it for me",0
412,Do you even ora ora ora?,2
413,"Tsukasa admitted himself that he'd stand no chance against a gun, during the part where he figured out Senku and company left him in order to make one.",0
414,Unless it rains.,2
415,They ran out of gunpowder and couldn't get more iirc.,2
416,"While they did choose to make katanas obviously because of rule of cool, there are actually plenty of reasons to go with a single edged design. The first of which is obviously time. Making a double edged sword takes about double the length of time because you have to make two edges. A pommel and crossguard would also cost resources and time. Although yes, metal polearms would have been far better practically. They're easier to make, cost less time, and cost less resources. But katanas are cool, so we're going with it. Honestly the only reason why katanas are everywhere is because swords went out of fashion in Europe in the 1800s, but stayed culturally relevant in Japan as a status symbol even after they were banned. If anything, them being banned probably immortalized them culturally.",1
417,polearms are crap without proper numbers and formation though.  on a bridge this is fine but im expecting that senku is expecting more skirmishes in a more open setting hence swords are the better choice also the village has spears already as a thrusting weapon a double edged blade sacrifices slashing power for thrusting power hence redundent.,0
418,"No. Spears are ridiculously effective in warfare and in a duel. Being double edged does not significantly reduce cutting power. I implore you to watch HEMA footage between spears and swords. The range and speed spears have is amazing. The only real weakness of a spear in a duel is getting the shaft grabbed, but that is relatively difficult to do.",0
419,     :,2
420,that hema footage is dumb legit no one tere even looks like they even thought about how to take on a polearm and it is cleary their first time against any polearm whatsoever.    i train in both kendo and naginata a one dojo and ive seen and experienced just how easy it is to take down a spear user 1v1     i know this matchup from both sides if the swordsman is inexpeirenced a spearmen can eaasily take on many opponentss back to back 1v1    but the instant the swordsman has hit a certain lv of skill no spearman in the world will be able to get close to beating him,0
421,ok some special cases but at that point they are no longer spearmen they are staff masters   you see they stop using a spear as a spear and more a quarterstaff that has a convenient pointy end for finishing people off,0
422,"A metal spear would be easier to make - but there's far more intimidation potential when you see that the ""Cavemen"" have motherfuckin  swords.  Senku didn't want to drag them into a drawn-out bloody battle, he wanted to break their spirits immediately so as to win the fight by default.",0
423,yes even hyuga said that senkus goal was to intimidate,1
424,      would they have enough iron for that doe? i personally agree with spears being the better option but considering the context of low amount of resources picking a sword that was developed in a similar context makes sense. That being said i dont think they went with a katana with this in mind,2
425,"probably wouldnt even take more materials - katanas are pretty top heavy weapons, whereas most long swords or probably really arming swords would be a more likely option, especially for the shield boys, which btw why dont they all have at least simple shields get thinner towards the top of the blade, which means less material for the same length of sword. plus, a single edged blade has lots of extra material on the blunt edge that would effectively be removed in order to get an edge there.    that being said. idk how much good a crossguard would do against the weapons theyre facing",1
426,"i did search to see the weight of katanas vs longswords and they are lighter, which unless im missing something means less materials",0
427,"i mean...it all depends on the individual sword. but longsword vs katana isnt a particularly 1:1 comparison, since longswords are generally longer than katanas, which is why i called out the arming sword european straight double edged sword, shorter than a long sword though i think its still a bit longer than a katana, generally speaking",1
428,"i used this link even on gmm its better, its not much but with the same amount of iron you can make 13 swords or 14 katanas",1
429,     Are they really? You can't form a Phalanx with 4 people.,2
430,Isn't that to counter charging cavalry? Spear has better reach so in a 1v1 scenario a spearman should be able to keep a swordman without mikiri counter at a safe distance.,1
431,"spears always work better in formations regarless if its cavalry or not, i honestly have no idea in a 1v1 scenario who would win but if the dude with a sword manages to get close i dont think someone with a spear can do anything",1
432,     If.,2
433,"well yeah, its not a imposible thing to happen",1
434,the dude with a sword will win 100% of the time if he has any experience against spears.     seriously taking on a spear isnt difficult take it from someone who practices both kendo and naginata.    all you need to do is slash at the spear to knock it aside then step within their efective range once your within that range winning is a cakewalk,1
435,"Yeah.. It isn't as easy as you are saying ""slash the spear aside then step inside the range"" yeah right because your opponent is braindead and won't​ try to step back and just left the spear there",0
436,You step in as you swat the spear aside a step forward is always larger then a step back and you can chase the  spearman on a retreat you follow backwards is always slower then forwards.  Its called pressing your advantage. Also a spearmans stance is wider and hence closer to the ground they will have slower footwork 100% of the time.    There is a reason i can beat every naginata student after i figured out hiw to beat one the master is an exception since he has no problems fighting in very close quarters.    Also naginata is more versatile then a spear slashing edge and that cant stand up against a sword.    From the spearmans side his best bet is to actually engage on you and use close range quarterstaff techniques to fight you once you swat his spear aside. A spearman can NEVER step back it leaves them open 100% of the time. A swordsmans step is larger then a spearmans.    And chucking a shield into the equation makes it even worse for the spearman one handed spear becomes even less versatile and slipping behind a shield is not difficult when you account for a shield blocking vision,0
437,As someone who has practiced both weapon in HEMA i have to disagree with some of your point  I can realign the spear fairly quickly after getting knock off balance and thrust the charging guy and stepping back doesn't​ left them open since you will have the spear point​in​g the opponent​ while stepping back you can also thrust  And from my experience​ thrust oriented spear are more versatile than striking based one like the naginata for more information​ see : Though i can agree with some of the shield part except blocking the vision part,0
438,naginata is actually thrust oriented 2 with the versatility of having a very threatening slashing edge as well as using a heavier wood that can double as a mass weapon.    a spear is pretty much thrust only sure u can slash but your never doing enough damage to do more then just annoy.    once ive knocked off ur spear allignment you have to step back realign and defend since the instant ur spear alignment is off im stepping in    your stance is wider then mine for stability but that slows down ur footwork hence my step in is faster then ur step back    also fundamentally an advance is always faster then a retreat ur open because i have already knocked the spear away    in the time it takes you to take one step back and realign ur spear and get into a stance i can take 3 steps forward and cut out your throat or thrust.    i have trained both naginata and kendo    in naginata when u have ur polearm swatted aside you go in and use ur weapon as a quarterstaff the wood is heavier then most actually one of the few woods denser then water you never retreat a spearman has the option of only engaging the instant you back off u lose. unless you use the butt of the spear to strike and create room.    the issue is a spear is a simple weapon easy to learn masters vs eexperienced veteran there is little difference to distinguish them    however a experienced verteran swordsman will never compare to a master swordsman the skill cap of a sword is much higher then a 2 dimensional weapon like a spear. its why spears areused in warfare its much more effective then a blade in formation but also ITS MUCH EASIER to train spearmen then it is to train swordsmen.    shields vision blocking really depends on the shield honestly but shieldwork is teamwork your shield protects the person next to you not yourself in a 1v1 a shield just takes up a hand and adds more weight to you.    amatuers will struggle against a shield but more experienced figthers will turn the shield against you,1
439,"yup. though tbh i dont think katanas are quite as bad an idea as people are making them out to be. i think spears or ranged weapons would definitely be better, but katanas are still heckin stronk against unarmored opponents with such short weapons. the only thing thatd really beat them is if someone on the other side had like, a spear or something     oh wait ",0
440,a spear is useless without proper formation    the dude with a sword will win 100% of the time if he has any experience against spears.     seriously taking on a spear isnt difficult take it from someone who practices both kendo and naginata.    all you need to do is slash at the spear to knock it aside then step within their efective range once your within that range winning is a cakewalk you could literally just punch them into submission.      ;    if someone gets into your effective range as a spear user drop the spear and pull out a dagger.,1
441,"     You are thinking of Pikes since they are designed to be used in a formation.          ""If"" is a strong word. Bypassing the tip of a spear is not easy against a spearman especially if they are trained. An average spearman could hold two swordsmen at bay. It takes less energy to thrust with a spear than it does to swing with a sword, by the way. I assume you never heard of Kung Fu Spear because a spear can fundamentally be used as a boquarterstaff in close combat.",0

447,issue with spears is that is small number skirmishes polearms suck ass    without proper formation swords are far better 1v1 swordsmen will always beat spearmen of similar skill    10 v 10 i guarantee the swordsmen arent breaking through,0
448,one edged swords allow for the differential hardness also    one edged curved blades are much better for slashing also less sensitive if u fuck up the edge alignment.    double edged blades are harder to handle and getting the balance right in making them is harder also they excel at thrusting but slashing power and stiffness is sacrificed    both weapons are even it comes down to the user not the tool,0

457,"A curved blade lends itself to deeper cuts even with just normal swings but yes i agree, a straight blade would be pretty much as good for them at this point. Also they are used to spears so a straight blade that is good for stabbing would probably be better for them.",1
458,Frankly if anything they should have just kept using spears. I get that swords are cool and all but people has already tested it and it just turns out that being able to poke at people with a pointy stick while you're at a safe distance is a really practical way to win a fight even if it's not all that fancy.,1
459,It is hard to get the intimidation factor of cutting up somebodies weapon with a spear though.,0
460,"Instead you get the intimidation factor of your enemy bleeding out on the ground, which is pretty close.",0
461,a dude with a sword will win 100% of the time if he has any experience against spears.     seriously taking on a spear isnt difficult take it from someone who practices both kendo and naginata.    all you need to do is slash at the spear to knock it aside then step within their efective range once your within that range winning is a cakewalk,1
462,"Maybe, though no one on team science has used a sword before either so that experience would be lacking.",0
463,"For you, uOhemjemania , uTylomin etc, if you wanna go with the context of a world without metal armor, then your best blades are actually  stone  itself, namely a natural glass like Obsidian, which is  absurdly  sharp, you can pretty easily knap an obsidian edge to be many times finer then even modern steel scalpels. It's less durable then a metal blade, and you can't make an actual full length sword out of it normally, but if you aren't hitting it against anything hard it'll shatter against, it'll cut insanely effectively.    This is a broader problem with Dr. Stone, which is that for as much as Dr;. Stone uses real chemistry and stuff, it pretty regularly falls for the fallacy of Stone = Inferior, and that there's even such a thing as a ""Stone Age""    Let me explain: The notion of a Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron age, etc originated in the early 1800's as a way to date artifacts found in europe in primitive archeology, and as a result it becoming became more or less just a convenient way to split up European and Near Eastern history into milestones. What it is  not , and what people misunderstand it as, is stages human civilization ""advances"" through.    Simply because European and MiddleNear Eastern civilization moved from one to the other does not mean they are set steps societies will go through. In real life, societal progression is not like a Tech tree in Civilization where there's a singular path all societies go through and you need to unlock certain technologies before advancing at least for the most part, obviously you aren't gonna invent the internet before computers or before electrcity, etc. In fact, dr. stone illustrates this: Senku is clearly able to to make use of Technologies that are far beyond a society in his condition are in simply because he knows about them, a society that happens upon the information can use it readily similarly.    Let's give a practical example, and one that circles back to Obsidian use for toolsweapons: The civilizations of Mesoamerica, such as the Aztec and Maya.     They usually get labaled as ""Stone age"" societies due to their relative lack of metal toolsweapons and use of stone, mainly obsidan, instead; and, that, combined with the fact that public education about them is near exclusively focused on their conquest by the Spanish though, ironically, it was the native city-states and kingdoms themselves that actually did all the fighting and the more bloody parts of their socity such as human sacrifice; most people are under the impression they are barely civilized, proto-civilizations having just acheived complex socities, just living in villages around pyramids and being surronded by tribal socities.    In reality, by the time the Spanish had arrived in Mexico, the region had those sort of proto-cities over 3000 years prior: By 1400 BC, there were sites with large pyramids, class systems, long distance trade, by 900 BC there was writing, and by 500 BC, formal state goverments and towns and cities had popped up all over the place. I made a summary from 1400BC all the way to 1519 when the spanish showed up here, which also delves into the lesser known but equally complex civilizatoons like the Zapotec, Mixtec, Teotihuacanos, Purepecha, etc here     These cities often had complex, interconnected water management systems with aquaducts, resvoirs, and drainage networks, some even had toilets and running water    They had formal, bureaucratic governments with courts and legal systems from 1491 by Charles Mann shows, displaying deep symbolism, and touching on themes of mortality, the meaning of life, etc.    Under the StoneBronzeIron age model, these societies, which almost every facet at least match the complexity and accomplishments of ones we see in the Eurasian Bronze and Iron ages, often, Clasical Antiquity, and in some ways even, Medieval Europoe, would yet be considered ""Stone Age"", which I think is sort of obviously not a good assessment: Would Nomadic African tribes who used iron weapons but lived in villages, had simple cheifdoms, etc be ""more advanced"" purely because they used iron?  What does ""advanced"" even mean, there's multiple solutions to solving human issues, after all. So instead have a different timeline model    In short, human societies do not all progress along the same pathway, Geographic no beasts of burden is a likely expanation for the limited wheel use, for instance, cultural, and political factors early Iron tools and weapons in Eurasia were actually inferior to bronze ones, they only switched due to the instability of the Bronze age collapse , and hell, even random chance all influence development and can cause socities to seem ahead or behind relative to how Europe developed.     This is actually a  short , condensed version of what i'd like toi post, but eh. Actually interested in doing a longer, fleshed out post using more examples from Dr. Stone itself. Would love to get it published by an actual anime newspublication site, If anybody has any ideas for sites that would accept pitches for using dr. stone as an example to talk about this sort of thing, let me know.",0
464,"Obsidian is hard to source, and stone weapons are both more fragile and heavier than steel weapons. If stone weapons could reliably compete with even bronze then bronze age cultures would have continued using them.     they did not.",0
465,"Arguing obsidian is better than steel against unarmoured opponents because it can be made sharper is like arguing that a 50 BMG is better than a 9mm for shooting rats because it can shoot through half an inch of steel.    Steel is sharp enough to deal lethal damage with a single cut so it makes sense to prioritize resilience, maneuverability and versatility over even more sharpness.",0
466,yes but obsidian is relatively fragile likely why steal katans culd break through their stoneblades :0,0
467,"There's no point to make it sharper than a steel sword. Wooden weapons with obsidian flakes were no competition for Spanish, because a single sword parry made them useless if not outright shattered. They were also notoriously heavy compared to Spanish rapiers.",0
468,"I'll address the broader point you are making in your comment in another comment I'll tag you in on, but          The flat faces of Macuahuitl were seemingly used for parrying, not the striking edge.  The Spanish also repeatedly noted and praised the effectiveness of Mesoamerican weapons and feared them.     Steel vs Obsidian wasn't a major factor in the slightest in the Spanish Conquest: Most Conquistadors could not afford metal armor and those that had it often abandoned it in favor of forms of Mesoamerican armor like ichcahuipilli, which was essentially a form of gambeson; so both most Mesoamerican soldiers excluding novices and porters, who were unarmored and most conquistadors were basically equally protected and their weapons both capable of injuring each other; with if anything the obsidian weaponry of the Mesoamericans being a bit better at cutting through the forms of gambeson being used by both sides.    A good example of this is how the Republic of Tlaxcala, the SPanish's greatest allies in the COnquest of Mexico, intially beat Cortes's force readily and only spared them at the last minute to then use against the Aztec, who had been invading and blockading them to be worn down and conquered. Even the Cannons and Calvary, which were two legitmate advantages the superior military technology the Spanish had DID bring, were not enough to overcome the gap in numbers.    Moreover, though, the Conquistadors throughout the decades of conflicts across the Conquest of Mexico, both in the intial campaign against the Aztec and subsquent ones against various other city-states and kingdoms across the region; were a small minorty of the actual troops on their side: Virtually every engagement had the Spanish-affiliated army being  also  mostly Mesoamerican soldiers, from either allied states attempting to use the spanish to take out their own political rivals, or from already conquered ones now at the Spanish's disposal. As an example, the Siege on Tenochtitlan The Aztec captial, had between 80,000 and 200,000 troops on the spanish side, and only around 1000 of them were Conquisradors, the rest being soldiers from around 7-8 other citiesstates and their dependcies. In these engagements, however, the aformeentiond cannons and calvary were a bigger deal, since with the aid of a large number of Mesoamerican infantry, cannons and calvary charges could blow holes in enemy mesoamerican formations and then the allied infantry could go in and exploit the chaos.    The other big factor, of course, was diseases: The initial smallpox epidemic essentially crippled Tenochtitlan and was what caused it to be able to be successfully taken, with half the city dead or dying before the fighting even started, and within 10 years you saw Black-Death level population losses with 30% of the region dead. Note, however, even after this and subsquent outbreaks there was another 20 years later around 1550 and then 1570, the Spanish still had a hard time conquering many areas despite the population losses from epidemics and having tens to hundreds of thousands of troops at their disposal from conqueredallied states.    The technological gap itself was really not at all a significant factor.",0
469,Really like your main point about how stonebronzeIron age labels fail to recognize the other aspects of different civilizations which the other commenters seem to be ignoring in favor of pointing out how obsidian isn’t good on a sword. Thanks for sharing! I’m inspired to read up on some of these civilizations now—would be happy to read more of what you write,1
470,personally i would use a european rapier     ;    te cutting power of a katana is great and has a good draw cut first strike but i would prefer the fast thrusting power of a rapier and the reach    but hell katanas are fucking cool,0
471,"Sure they are, but spears ",1
472,"It's also Japan. No matter how you look at it, the ore available there is scarce and of low quality. Even if they had armor there's going to be little of it.",0
473,"And for low skill cutting! You don't have to cut with the best edge alignment, because the angle of the edge is so big that a katana that hits something straightens itself a bit, the blade rolls in a good edge alignment.

474,That's not really true either.    ,0
475,"One thing to keep in mind here: All of Senku's opponents are modern day Japanese people.    So, from a psy-ops standpoint, it makes sense to craft a sword that the enemy already holds in high regards.",0

477,"Yeah, they're making weapons for the battlefield, swords being the primary weapon in a planned battle is in the minority I'm pretty sure. They're more of an EDC    But there's also the fact that they needed to not hurt anyone because shounen, so the katana to slice their weapons works well.",0
478,"This is def a rule of cool moment. I'm pretty sure the spear was used more as a weapon of war in Japanese history, and would have been more useful here.     Katana are cooler I suppose.",1
479,"Not only that, historically, the primary weapon of the samurai during war were the bow and arrow. IIRC, the skill with yumi  japanese bow was more valued. It was only during the Tokugawa era where Japan was at peace that the legend of the katana  swords emerged more as a status symbol for the samurai since there was no use for the more practical weapons of war like the bow or spear.",0
480,wasn't that also around when muskets were becoming much more common in japan? making specialized archers not as necessity. the legends of the katana were spread to keep Samurai in a higher standing. if a peasant can fight as effectively as a knight with only a few weeks of training then feudalism loses allot of its power.,0
481,yes it was mounted archery with 110 pund draw weight bows that could pierce plate armour     the knight vs samurai debate is not katana vs longsword. it is samurai win because horseback archery using bows that pierce through armour. european armour is not designed for projectile protection its a balanced armour whereas samurai Armour is very specialized ballistics armour and japanese longbows can pierce through this hence european armour would lose    heck we still use the ceramic plating as armour against firearms to this day,1
482,"Spears were used more because its easier to produce and learn, but more importantly, cavalry were the greatest forces in Japan during those times. Without a good formation and little room to maneuver like in the show, swords would actually be better.",1
483,in japan the greatest forces were mounted archers. wars were almost entirely fought from a distance,0
484,I like how he said that and then they lost 3 v 1 against an spear,1

487,"Because they are not. The best swords especially against unarmoured targets were sabres, which is proven by the simple fact, that pretty much the entire world adopted them between XV and XIX centuries while the design was being perfected. It's longer, faster and being one-handed gives more mobility and reach to the user, while at the same time making the user a smaller target himself due to sideways stance.        Katanas were a product of isolated Japan which didn't have to face outside enemies and long forging process was a way of utilising poor quality local iron ore. Actually this forging makes sense in the anime as primitive bloomer iron is usually bad quality, so they should put more effort into forging, but they would have achieved better results with something resembling a sabre.",1
488,"Damascus Swords was the sharpen Swords of this time. it could even cut trough silk, so i bet even the harden Samurai protection cloths of the Landlords would have a hard time with them, until they invent the chain-mail",0
489,lol is this comment written to trigger me,1
490,are you that famous?,2
491,i mean best katana vs best dasmascus blade its actually even from a scientific standpoint looking at the lattice structures.    katana is better for slashing and for draw cuts iaijutsu     dasmascus swords win out in thrusting and reach    knight vs samurai     samurai wins cause horseback archery with longbows that can easily pierce steal pate armour = op also armour designed for projectile protection so a knights crossbow with less draw weight and cant be fired from horseback cant pierce samurai armour its designed for protection v projectiles .    whereas in close quarters knights are better thanks their armour being better built against slashes and mass weapons. but the fight would never get to close quarters,1
492,"Arrows preform very poorly against plate armor, but very well against the lightly armored majority of any army, East or West. A 160lb English longbow would probably penetrate a Samurai's armor, but maybe not. Most longswords are slightly longer than most katanas, but are effective at cutting for less of that length. The average longsword is going to be slightly lighter, and balanced closer to the hand, making it much better at thrusting and easier to defend with, while sacrificing cutting power. These are both sidearms to a polearm though, which is what it would come down to. A man in full plate will very rarely, if ever, use a bow, and he is also mostly impervious to arrows. I'd say the knight has a slight advantage in both the melee and the charge, but the samurai likely has the ability to withdraw at will, or choose the terms of the engagement. Close matchup, no obvious winner.",1
493,Close matchup favors the knight just because any mass weapon will literally shatter samurai armour its mostly ceramic after all.    Samurai longbows from 75 m or less have 0 problems punching through plate armour 140-220 pound draw weights. And about 25% heavier arrows. Samurai armour was built for their type of warfare horseback archery their weaponry evolved to match.  75 m sounds unimpressive but these archers could ride and shoot at the same time so the knight would be chasing all while being rained woth arrows that could punch through his breastplate and then the armour on his back,0
494,"Thes videos show that bows can't penetrate plate armor. Even if it could somehow penetrate it will only penetrate the surface of it and won't go deeper, the arrow tip would be flattened so much that it will no longer pierce flesh or it will barely go into it.    ",0
495,what arrows are they using what wood is the arrow made of and what type of tip does it have as well as the design + draw weight of the bow. i do kendo and nagainata training not related but y master for kendo does archery     ive seen his arrows punch straight through 10cm of akagashi and protrude about 11 cm behind it and punch clean through a steal plate and then punch a hole in the wall behind it yeah that wasnt him firing that was a gorilla classmate of mine on a dare. these arrows are meter long arrows made from very dense wood akagashi is heavier then water + the tip is also made from tamahagane samurai where rich kids and is larger then a english arrow.    the arrowhead is 7 cm long and 4 cm wide this makes the arrowhead incredibly heavy and much harder.     i looked at those videos those arrowheads are very slim and light definitely not the kind to bring against plate armour also the arrowheads are small. of course they arent piercing + the draw weights of their bow judging from the thickness of the bow would sit at about 90 pounds at best and 60 pounds at worst.     these arrows were designed specifically to punch through armour that was built specifically to defend against arrows,1
496,A steel plate that is made with mild non hardened metal or not properly shaped is not the same as plate armour which is hardened and tempered properly. The arrows they use in the videos are historically used against armour. Some of the bows used were 150 pounds which is far more poundage than many Samurai bows.,2
497,my masters bow has a 220 pound draw weight and he says thats on the the middle end of the spectrum. look at those arrows close up there flat tipped not broad and there hardly larger then 3-4 cm long and the wood is lighter and there is less metal and the arrowheads are made from a softer iron. adding 30 % weight to the wood and then doubling the length of the arrowhead making it very top heavy makes a massive differnce in penetrating power. arrows were slightly thicker too. the armour piercing properties came down to the weight of the projectile and design of the arrowhead and less the bow poundage.    also generally you would be firing from pretty damn close range 10- 75 m as they are firing off horseback basicalaly any distance thats not in mellee striking distance was safe. even if the breastplate was really well made 99% of the time it wasnt there are still many places that te arrow could punch through like butter.     good steal was used in a samurais arrow Samurai were rich as fuck whereas the chance a knight had perfect quality armour that was properly hardened by the best craftsmen likely their armour wasnt as good as what we have today.    by steal plate im talking 5mm thick that we use to measure the striking force of a naginata blunt strike back or using the pole and basically try to dent it as badly as possible using a blunt strike with the naginata    in the end capitalism wins    edit : holy shit we went down a rabbithole how did we get here from a dr stone discussion lmao,1
498,"Even if it penetrated it won't guarantee a kill as I have stated many times and unless you have sources shown where arrows pierce authentic plate armour I doubt it. Where are your sources on 220-pound bow cause that it is unlikely for a horse bow as you aren't able to get that much stability on a horse. In fact, European are stronger on average than Japanese due to their diet including meat when most Japanese were vegetarian and were bigger on average than the Japanese and yet the 200-pound bow or more were not the norm but it did exist. The knight armour was used by the rich as well and is better than many Samurai armour due to the arms race forcing Europeans to create better armour and was used against the English which uses the longbow and the French won, in the end, proving that bow doesn't win the war. The arrowhead used was bodkin as sharp-pointed arrows existed and were used against chain mail but would have snapped against plate armour. The longer arrows wouldn't have made it better against armour as that would only make it heavier thus decreasing their speed. Even if 200 plus pound bows were used by the Japanese they were definitely not the norm. Regardless even with the bow and arrows you mentioned it would have not done much serious damage due to the padding underneath the plate armour and at best a small cut to the knight. The reason guns changed warfare as it made it easy to penetrate plate armour and was easy to train soldiers to use it, bows aren't mean to penetrate armour at best they were aimed at exposed areas of the armour, the gaps in the visor or the horse themselves. If Japanese armour can protect against arrows there is no reason European armour couldn't as their blacksmithing techniques were equally as great or maybe even more as the Japanese employed European style cuirass on their armour later. This video addresses some of your statements.    ",1
499,Japanese samurai armour could withstand those exact firearms that medieval plate armour couldn't disposable ceramic plates are amazing against projectiles. We still use ceramic plates tpday for military body armour. We dont use european plate armour. That should speak enough about the projectile protection it provided.    Also plate armour isnt the same strength across the entire plate there are parts weaker then others also its incredibly easy to aim from about 20 m anyway up to point blank on horseback you can get scarily close and still be safe. I guarantee no plate armour stands up to a point blank shot,1
500,"Wrong we still use plate armour in our armour for example the AR500 Armor level IIIA Body Armor is made of steel plate. Also plate armour could withstand bullets. Ceramic armour doesn't exist in Japan so your statement is nonsense. Plate armour was still used in the 17th century and munition armour was also used against bullets. The Cuirassiers and the Winged Hussars were known to use plate armour against enemies with guns. The modern combat soldier helmet is made of steel and the various armoured vehicle still used steel.     Check all these videos where plate armour protected against muskets and a blog which talks about Japanese and European armour.  According to Wikipedia on the Breastplate article stated that ""Bullet-proof vests are the modern descendant of the breastplate"".   ",0
501,"japanese samurai armour had either ceramic, iron or leather scales.",2
502,Check my videos first and my links first and nope they don't have ceramic if you want to prove me wrong show me your source on that. Basically I'm right plate armour could protect against arrows and bullets shown in the videos and many sources.,0
503,"I'm gonna need a source on their arrows defeating 3mm of either mild steel or wrought iron. Even as early as Agincourt, 150-200lb longbows failed at penetrating a breastplate at as little as 25m. By the late 100 Years War, minor advances in armor and major advances in tactics allowed the French to march through arrows with impunity. These guys are 10x as arrow-proof as the legions that got bullied by Hunnic horse archers.",0
504,They were good for the quality of iron used and good against non metal armour. Context is important.,1
505,"European swordman here, 6 years experience and currently in prep for my provost grading. Here's my perspective.    The idea of a ""best sword"" is kinda meaningless. Best at what? In who's hands? Katanas are good cutters but there are plenty of swords throughout the world which are on par with them or better and this is only one consideration when it comes to blade design.    Cutting through a spear shaft isn't difficult when it's held in a vice or stuck in the ground but cutting through them when they're held by a resisting opponent is another thing entirely. Sword vs spear is generally a terrible idea without a shield but I'll happily let this slide in an anime though because swords are just cooler.    Given this I do think katanas are a pretty good choice.    The Japanese contrary to what certain anime tell you historically had bad quality ore but katanas were designed to work around these limitations by hammering and folding out the impurities, and using a combination of differential hardening with short thick blades to make them reliant enough to use in combat. Senku wouldn't be working with fantastic ore either so he'd need to make similar compromises to prevent the blades from breaking.    None of the village warriors have used a sword either and I'd argue katanas are well suited for beginners. They're short and single edged which makes them safer to handle than a say a European longsword and the curve and thickness of the blade makes them more forgiving of poor technique when it comes to cutting.",1
506,"Yeah, something like a messer or falchion would cut better, but will be more likely to break considering how rushed they were. Also a thin, flexible blade will probably turn in the hand of someone who's only trained with a spear.",1
507,Katanas are actually pretty heavy for their length.,1
508,"You have no idea what you're talking about. A European longsword two-handed, the ones you're thinking of are actually called arming swords is longer despite weighing about the same as a Katana about 1.5 kilos or 3 pounds",0

510,No.,0

518,its not simply the steel being folded that made the katana so deadly. it was that the steel was ridden of impurities and the carbon reinforced the blade. it was durable and razer sharp.,2
519,"Nope that was the same for European swords too, the difference is that Europe used spring tempering which made it more durable but does not maintain its sharpness as long. Folding is to get rid of impurities which the European did as well.",1

582,crossbows are fine without muscles its longbows that need strength as long as you can lift the crossbow ur fine you can use a pulley system to pull the string back this is actually how the strongest crossbows are loaded,1
583,The main appeal of crossbows is not requiring muscle. You can draw them with a crank.    Big poundage military longbows are what require strength.,1
584,"     Completely false, strength has absolutely nothing to do with your ability to use a bow, the only real factor in archery is skill.",1
585,"You've never pulled a bow I see. The most simple bows take a flat amount of force and release it in one moment. The amount of force is based on how strong the bow is while being able to be pulled back.    Crossbows can be made two ways, simple or crank. Simple has the same problem, but higher base force because you generally use you bigger leg muscles to help set it. But this also means a slower fire rate.     Compounds are holy lovechild in which force is compounded by use of pulleys, but until full tension is achieved they still require full strain, whereas in simple bows that strain builds up the further back you try and pull it.",0
586,You need to train to have the muscles to pull back the bowstring. If you don't have the muscle mass you'll get tired quickly.,0
587,"That is also completely false. I do archery and can say with absolute certainty that you will never need to train yourself to be strong enough to use a bow. The reason for this is simple: Bows come at different draw weights number determining how hard they are to pull back, so if you feel like a bow is either too easy or too hard to pull back you simply get a different bow that feels more comfortable. You don't need to adjust your own physique to fit the bow when it's so much easier to just get a bow that fits you, and trying to do it the way you suggest is just ill advised and there are several reasons why any archer would strongly recommend that you never, ever try to learn archery the way you're suggesting.",1
588,What I was going for is that I guess you'd need a minimum draw weight to get a bow you can actually use over a long distance in a war.,0
589,"Common myth that beginner archers like to ask about when given an introduction, but surprisingly not entirely true. You see, archery has a maximum range after which even the most skilled archer will stop being able to make accurate shots, and as it turns out even lower draw weight bows should be able to shoot arrows far enough to reach that range. Keeping that in mind, it's generally agreed that draw weight has a very insignificant effect all things considered and the real thing that will help you out is good technique.",0
590,"What kind of archery do you do? Because that sounds like sports to me which is completely different from the use of, for example, old english longbows and what bodily transformations english longbowmen went through to be able to achieve mastery of their weapon.    Sports ain't war.",1
591,"I do barebow recurve archery.    Anyway, to get into why the thing I'm saying still applies in this war archery:    1. The bodily transformation you speak about which I presume is bigger back muscles since those are the ones used in archery is simply the result of shooting a lot. Turns out that using muscles makes them bigger. This will happen even if you use a bow with a comfortable draw weight instead of your suggestion of using a bow that is too heavy for you. Once you get stronger with your appropriately weighted bow, you simply get a heavier bow that fits your newfound level of strength.    2. As you mentioned, using a bow that is heavier than what you can handle means you get fatigued faster. This means you get less practice time, which is simply a waste. Why use a heavier bow that you can only practice with 10 minutes daily before tiring out when everyone else uses a bow of an appropriate weight for them and thus gets to spend 4+ hours per day perfecting their aim? Your heavy bow strategy just means you fall behind all the other archers in terms of skill. And of course, that additional time spent practicing also goes into building their muscles, so they're probably still going to grow those huge back muscles much faster than you.    3. This is the big one and the main reason any archer will recommend that you never use a bow that is too hard for you to draw back comfortably: Using a bow that is too heavy messes up your technique. You simply won't be able to shoot the correct way when you constantly need to fight against a bow that isn't comfortable to pull back. The end result, of course, is that you will end up spending years practicing how to shoot the bow, but with the  wrong technique . And the thing is, practice makes permanent. This means that once you've accomplished this body transformation you're speaking of, you will have spent years training yourself to shoot a bow  badly , actively making yourself a worse archer by giving yourself bad shooting habits from the beginning. And of course, once you've managed to teach yourself those bad habits, they are an absolute bitch to get rid of.    Basically, it's just all around a  terrible  idea.",0
592,"See, my problem with your arguments is this: If you say one never needs to train oneself to be strong enough to use a bow, then why did people train themselves to be strong enough to use a bow more efficiently?     I'd say giving unmuscular people a bow a common trope btw is a bad idea in warfare, and so is training unmuscular people to use a bow. Because they'd need to build muscles first. Because they actually need to pierce their targets, not only hit them perfectly.    Give them spears or crossbows.    But thank you for your insight. I appreciate it.",1
593,"     As I mentioned, getting stronger is simply a result of using the bow as it does involve using your muscles, which is exercise, which builds strength. People didn't need to build muscles before they started using the bow, they could simply do both at the same time by spending a lot of time practicing archery. Far more efficient, and efficiency is good.",1
594,"     So what you're saying is...    They need to train their muscles to use a bow.    Low poundage bows are not useful for war.     You agree with the person that they need to train their muscles. You're just saying that they will train their muscles by using weaker bows, which the original person never argued against.    You're arguing literally nothing.",0

You talk from a position of authority on the matter, but you don't seem to really know anything about archery combat.

610,     Why do you think I quoted you? Hmm?,2
611,A range bigger draw weight = more range    B accuracy bigger draw weight = more projectile speed hence less affected by wind     C accuracy again easier to fire line of sight    D pierce    pick one,2
612,"Okay, so in order:    A: Sort of, but not quite. What's important to keep in mind is that when shooting a bow there's a lot of factors going into a shot, and very small variations in how you hold the bow and your posture can easily lead to your aim being off by a degree or two, which seems insignificant but does translate to very significant differences once you get a couple dozen meters away. While experienced archers do manage to refine this down to an impressively small error rate, there are still always going to be a decent amount of it due to just how many factors go into it. What this means is that due to human limitations bows do reach a hard cap in distance that you can expect them to be useful at, and after that point you're basically just wasting arrows in an attempt to win the lottery. Now luckily for beginners, that particular effective distance is one you can more or less reach using a more beginner friendly draw weight. Then there's also how using a too high draw weight likely means that you won't be able to pull the string all the way back anyway which likely just means the arrow is going to fire worse than it would at a more appropriate draw weight.    B: Eh, as mentioned at the end of A, when using a draw weight that is at a higher weight than what is comfortable it does impact your ability to draw the bow back properly, which will just result in a bad release. This usually ends up in the arrow sort of flying off the string at an odd angle, making a not awfully aerodynamic flip mid air, and flopping lazily to the ground about 2-5 meters in front of you. And of course, when using an uncomfortably high draw weight the difficulty of pulling the string back means that you have a harder time paying attention to your posture and such, further degrading your aim and over time ingraining that less perfect posture into you as a habit, which I've already discussed the downside of.    C: Now the topic of line of sight is a bit of an interesting one actually, because line of sight works in a very counter intuitive way in archery. Best shown through illustration. This is a very common way for beginners to shoot, as bows are held so that the nock is lower than the eye, and when you then try to line the arrow head up with the target it results in a lot of angling upwards and therefore shooting far above the target. Now what this means is that when it comes to archery, your line of sight can't be trusted and is therefore basically useless. This, of course, means that the way to get good aim really just boils down to getting a lot of practice to get used to how you need to shoot to hit stuff at various ranges and slowly committing it to muscle memory.    D: Arrows shot at higher draw weights should penetrate stuff better yeah. However, I do think a lot of people manage to take this logic in reverse and reason themselves into thinking that arrows shot at lower draw weights are shit at penetrating things, which is certainly not the case. Thing is, even at beginner friendly draw weights all the force in the shot is still going to end up concentrated on a very small area, which happens to be a very efficient recipe for stabbing through things. Heck, people have gotten hospitalized by toy bow and arrows for kids, and those are far below what an adult beginner would use. And of course, yet again it should be pointed out that your ability to penetrate a target depends on being able to hit them in the first place, and as I covered earlier your ability to do that is diminished if you use a bow that is at a higher draw weight than what is comfortable.",1
613,I see thank you for the explanation  i get what you mean now. Thanks,1
614,"Oh so you have used a bow, you just don't understand the concept of the amount of force needed in bows used in warfare.",0
615,You seem to be misunderstanding what I'm talking about. Please reread it more carefully.,1
616,"Yup, that works fine when you're shooting a target and just need the arrow to stick.    Not when shooting people.    You want an arrow to actually stop someone, not just be a nuisance.",2

618,Yup,2
619,"the time constraint was the biggest hurdle. if they had more time then crossbows would have undoubtedly have been a better choice, they could have set up baracades, spikes, made a neat little killbox around the bridge.     another thing to consider.

638,"That holds true for all weapons though, better to make one which is similar to one they already have proficiency in. For defending the bridge a spear would be best, but a sword and shield is also a pretty good alternative - especially if they get some armour even if it's just leather or lacquered wooden.          Less effective with untrained archers is just asking for defeat. Poor accuracy and puncturing power just wouldn't be worth it compared to spears on the bridge. And on fighting on either side they don't really have the numbers to form two lines, so would be better off sticking to melee especially if they advance off the island, where arrows wouldn't help amongst trees.          The same reason they can't use guns because it's wet. Either the lack the crafting expertise to create complex metal objects, or because it's detrimental to the plot.

642,"For you, umanaworkin, uKurosov , and uCandayence , even if you limit it to swords and other melee weapons, using Katanas or steel weapons at all in this setting is sort of not the best solution. Metals are more durable then stone, but stone is  sharper , many times so depending on the specific type: you can pretty easily knap an obsidian edge to be many times finer then even modern steel scalpels. Against Metal armor, it'll shatter most of the time, but when your targets are only wearing cloth or are naked, it'll cut way better.     This is a broader problem with Dr. Stone, which is that for as much as Dr;. Stone uses real chemistry and stuff, it pretty regularly falls for the fallacy of Stone = Inferior, and that there's even such a thing as a ""Stone Age""    Let me explain: The notion of a Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron age, etc originated in the early 1800's as a way to date artifacts found in europe in primitive archaeology, and as a result it becoming became more or less just a convenient way to split up European and Near Eastern history into milestones. What it is  not , and what people misunderstand it as, is stages human civilization ""advances"" through.    Simply because European and MiddleNear Eastern civilization moved from one to the other does not mean they are set steps societies will go through. In real life, societal progression is not like a Tech tree in Civilization where there's a singular path all societies go through and you need to unlock certain technologies before advancing at least for the most part, obviously you aren't gonna invent the internet before computers or before electrcity, etc. In fact, dr. stone illustrates this: Senku is clearly able to to make use of Technologies that are far beyond a society in his condition are in simply because he knows about them, a society that happens upon the information can use it readily similarly.    Let's give a practical example, and one that circles back to Obsidian use for toolsweapons: The civilizations of Mesoamerica, such as the Aztec and Maya.     They usually get labaled as ""Stone age"" societies due to their relative lack of metal toolsweapons and use of stone, mainly obsidan, instead; and, that, combined with the fact that public education about them is near exclusively focused on their conquest by the Spanish though, ironically, it was the native city-states and kingdoms themselves that actually did all the fighting and the more bloody parts of their socity such as human sacrifice; most people are under the impression they are barely civilized, proto-civilizations having just acheived complex socities, just living in villages around pyramids and being surronded by tribal socities.    In reality, by the time the Spanish had arrived in Mexico, the region had those sort of proto-cities over 3000 years prior: By 1400 BC, there were sites with large pyramids, class systems, long distance trade, by 900 BC there was writing, and by 500 BC, formal state goverments and towns and cities had popped up all over the place. I made a summary from 1400BC all the way to 1519 when the spanish showed up here, which also delves into the lesser known but equally complex civilizatoons like the Zapotec, Mixtec, Teotihuacanos, Purepecha, etc here     These cities often had complex, interconnected water management systems with aquaducts, resvoirs, and drainage networks, some even had toilets and running water    They had formal, bureaucratic governments with courts and legal systems from 1491 by Charles Mann shows, displaying deep symbolism, and touching on themes of mortality, the meaning of life, etc.    Under the StoneBronzeIron age model, these societies, which almost every facet at least match the complexity and accomplishments of ones we see in the Eurasian Bronze and Iron ages, often, Clasical Antiquity, and in some ways even, Medieval Europoe, would yet be considered ""Stone Age"", which I think is sort of obviously not a good assessment: Would Nomadic African tribes who used iron weapons but lived in villages, had simple cheifdoms, etc be ""more advanced"" purely because they used iron?  What does ""advanced"" even mean, there's multiple solutions to solving human issues, after all. So instead have a different timeline model    In short, human societies do not all progress along the same pathway, Geographic no beasts of burden is a likely expanation for the limited wheel use, for instance, cultural, and political factors early Iron tools and weapons in Eurasia were actually inferior to bronze ones, they only switched due to the instability of the Bronze age collapse , and hell, even random chance all influence development and can cause socities to seem ahead or behind relative to how Europe developed.     This is actually a  short , condensed version of what i'd like toi post, but eh. Actually interested in doing a longer, fleshed out post using more examples from Dr. Stone itself. Would love to get it published by an actual anime newspublication site, If anybody has any ideas for sites that would accept pitches for using dr. stone as an example to talk about this sort of thing, let me know.",0
643,Isn't that the 12th time you wrote this post with only 10% of it pertaining to the show or are there 2 of you relaying each other to copy paste it over several accounts?,2
644,"thanks for the high quality effort. i enjoyed reading it, even though i might forget it all lol. it stuns me everytime im reminded of the variety of people enjoying the same stuff i do.",1
645,"     Obsidian is classified as a glass, not stone. And they don't have a ready supply of it.     Why are you pinging me to your little essay anyway? I know ancient history pretty well, but it's irrelevant to Dr. Stone because they can skip past the innovative step. If they wanted realism, they'd go straight to percussion cap guns so they could shoot in the rain.     As it is, they had limited resources and needed to make weapons that'd work when wet. From both a practical and morale based perspective, katanas are perfect for this. They're melee weapons which the village are familiar with, work in the wind and wet, and are a lot more intimidating than stone.",0
646,good god this post lmao,1
647,"I mean Tsukasa can catch arrows out of the air, so a sword might actually be more effective.",1
648,Crossbows would be a dead giveaway that they don't have guns.,0
649,"How so?    They can't use guns in a storm so they have backup weapons, or they had crossbows made before they made guns.",0
650,Strong wind during a storm and untrained wielders don't sound effective. Also no psychological damage.,0
651,Getting impaled by a bolt sounds pretty damaging both physically and mentally to me though.,2
652,"That is if the bolt hits, during strong winds, wielded by literal cavemen. While trying to not actually kill.",1
653,"Why would they not try to kill? The enemy is certainly down for it. But this is shounen, so you are correct...     elsiesigh",1
654,For one Byakuya told Senkuu to save people and create a better world. Secondly it would prove Tsukasa right.,1
655,"Ohhhh, I forgot Senkuu even said himself that he wants to save as many people as possible. You right, you right",1
656,"As many people as possible ≠ everyone.    If you're an existential threat to the cause, then get fuckin killed.    This shit only works on shounen where they have plot armor.",0

659,"It would also do jackshit in a windy rainstorm being wielded by cavemen. Even if the bow string wasn't ruined, the high winds would make accuracy nigh impossible in the hands of people who have never used one before.",1
660,"Not to mention katanas keep the gun bluff going. Making crossbows might give away that they don't have guns yet, which would give the Kingdom of Might an excuse to attack quickly. It's far more believable that they made guns but also made katanas for when it rains, rather than that they made guns and also suspiciously new crossbows.     And y'know, the characters were also clearly super excited about the katanas, and Senku needed the knife made anyway",1
661,Tbf he tried a crossbow against tsukasa and it did jackshit,2
662,     Senkuu has said that?,2
663,IIRC it was pretty early in the series.,1
664,"From what I remember one of the reasons he went for katanas, that wasn't included in the anime, was because on a psychological level they would take some of the fight out of the thugs. He wanted to cause an impression.",0
665,"Yeah, exactly, Senku was like ""these guys are just Japanese randos, they were  raised  on the myth of katanas being like the deadliest weapon in existence, they're going to shit themselves as soon as they see them"".",1
666,"thing is that there is nobody in the village expierenced in archery i think, and they needed to be prepared quickly",1
667,"Yea but no one has any experience with crossbows, but katanas are similar to spears in fighting style, so it makes more sense",0
668,"They’re fighting JoJo characters, a crossbow bolt won’t be effective",1
669,"Honestly, I don't know why the village doesn't already have crossbows.  They've had nearly 4000 years to get some tech going.",1
670,A simple bow would have given them lots of advantages . Wonder why Tsukasa doesn’t have any since it’s quite primitive.,1
671,It was about demoralizing them. Senku knew they were Japanese. The sword is a symbol of authority.,1
672,How about a Hwacha? They have gunpowder.,2
673,"     They're good for accuracy, but actually worse than a bow due to how slow it is to reload in comparison. What it might be good for is arming women and children though lol",1
674,The power of a crossbow comes from the fact that most people can use them with little training or practice. They were so devastatingly powerful to ancient warfare that they are the only weapon to be outright banned by the church.,0
675,     -         Hmmm...,2
676,"     They might've been banned, but it's not because of this. Bows were still the superior weapon.",1

I'm going to guess because of the blade spinning in a wide arc, the spearhead didn't penetrate too deep.       COOL! COOLER! COOLEST!     Well someone's enjoying Kaseki's thickness          Senku for best actor. I love his scared look! xD    KATANAS! OF COURSE THEY'LL MAKE KATANAS! Now I hope Senku teaches them how to make hakamas too to complete the look!      Maybe Hyogo will join? He seems interested at least. I do hope he does, Kingdom of Sceince has plenty of capable fighters but at the rate of Tsukasa reviving stronger and stronger people, they might need to convince more to join their side.",1

These stone people are in a literal sense stuck in purgatory. Can't die, but alive, stuck in a realm of self awareness in eternal darkness.",0
711,"If you're using Senku's experience as a benchmark, I don't think it works. Senku's mind drifting in and out was just him almost giving in to the stone and not thinking anymore, like most people. There is Yuzuriha who couldn't remember anything because she blacked out at some point for instance. And I think he said ""every 800 000 seconds or so I drift off"", not 800 years.",2

Whereas Tsukasarules with fear and  death and wouldn't think twice on killing Senku and the village, just reinforcing that his ideals are more sociphatic rather than altruistic, and that he doesn't have intentions of creating a Kingdom for the good of humanity or the planet like he states, but as a self personall obsessive interest only.",0
718,He actually said Empire of Might and I was mildly annoyed at the mistranslation because Kingdom vs Empire sounds cooler than Kingdom vs Kingdom.,0

762,"After last week's episode, the ED is much more poignant.",2
763,Yea it definitely hits harder now. I hope we get more Byakuya and Senku moments in the future.,1
764,What's their biggest obstacle in making primitive guns? The lack of enough gunpowder?,0
765,Yes. Currently Tsukasa Kingdom is in control of the Batcave,1
766,Senku needs the nitric acid from the bat cave to make gunpowder.,2
767,Metallurgy advanced enough to make reliable barrels    That shit's hard and requires a lot of manpower,1
768,Aren't matchlock barrels just tubes? It's not like he needs rifling.,0
769,"And even making a tube is pretty labor intensive and requires properly developed techniques.    You're also forgetting the matchlock mechanism itself. Gotta figure out how to make springs.     Then you also need gunpowder itself and it takes a long time to make unless they have an easily accessible source of nitric acid, or potatassoum nitrate. The closest known source is controlled by their enemy.     You need a steel barrel , not just an iron tube. Getting enough  material  in a couple of months, especially during incoming winter, to arm 50 ish people on their scale would be impossible. Then you need to turn that material into steel, which you then have to turn into barrels and matchlock mechanisms, on top of the wood bits.    And they only have a single craftsman.     Don't forget that the ironsand they're using is also not the best way to get iron out there since it requires far more work to get something good enough out of it. They need ore of good quality if they want to make realible guns fast.    It's an entire supply chain that would take years to develop and refine. Just for guns. They only have untill spring, it's a tiny village as well.    This video shows it well what it takes to make a single old ass gun. They could speed the process up by developing machining tools but that also takes a lot of resources, manpower and time. Neither of which they have.    They're better off makingng pikes and crossbows then drilling villagers. And given the state of the village most of them aren't really fit for combat. Neither do they have enough supplies.",0
770,"     Yes, gunpowder was the main limiting reagent listed by the show itself im pretty sure.         Couldn't you say the same for a lot of the shit they have made?         I don't know anything about making springs tbh, but again, is it really much harder than what he has accomplished so far?    You could also try to do a good old hand sparked flint.           If that's the case, then by shounen rules that's probably months.    And they aren't up north, right? There shouldn't be serious snow during winter or anything. Nothing an established tribe can't handle pretty easily.",1
771,"     Surviving any winter, no matter how bad, requires food stockpiles and they only have fishing to feed them. They'll develop stuff later but right now they're kinda fucked.",0
772,No? That's only for winters in colder climates where everything dies. You trying to tell me that you have to stockpile food for a winter on the equator?,0
773,"I'm saying that all they have is fishing, they don't farm. No necessary food processing knowledge either. A lot harder to stockpile food.",1
774,Manpower as well,1
775,"Senku: ""You utter fool!   German science     Nippon steel   is the world's finest!""",0

778,"Yeah their basic iron is quite impure, which is also why Katanas wouldnt hold up against medieval europe swords       But they found a way around it to make it usable, thats what I love about humans. We always find a way to make it work in the end",1

780,Unless they sold you the one with impurities. Did those guys actually get fined? It was a pretty big industry scandal...,1
781,"I have to question Tsukasa's logic.    He brings people back but it's all grunts. I guess for labor but these guys are dumb as hell. What is he doing?     ""Here I'll find as many similar looking grunty somewhat brutish dumb guys.""",0
782,"Influence. He's a famous mma fighter, who is best to be an early supporter that won't cause trouble while we build up. Undying mma fans.",1

784,"He probably has plenty of different kinds of people, it's just that those grunts are the ones he sent out for fighting work.",0
785,"Tbh, I found it weird then, and find it weird now, those people look way more like cavemen than the villagers. I mean, they are dumb nameless mooks, but they really don't need to look like that, they could look like normal people.    Tsukasa does have non grunts though, like Hyouga and Gen.",1
786,"In terms of body type, they look more like bodybuilders, to be honest. If you compare an Olympic weightlifter to a competitive bodybuilder, there's a stark difference in appearance. The inhabitants of the village are more apt to look like very fit, but otherwise normal people, instead of the kind of aesthetically muscled look that the mooks had. Hyouga having a more conventional design further reinforces the idea that he's trained himself for practical spear-fighting??? instead of just raw strength and appearance. If Tsukasa is just using appearance as a primary criteria for reviving people, super muscle bound folks are probably at the top of the list, even if that doesn't necessarily translate to good fighting ability.",1

795,One thing: they better kill those guys. There’s literally no reason to leave strong people from Tsukasa’s army alive. It’s gonna be stupid if they leave them to go back to something,0
796,"Senku wants to save everyone, he has no reason to kill people if he can instead convince them to join him.",0
797,"Or help spy from within, especially if Hyoga joins their side. Would be more interesting if he doesn't though",1
798,How can they really trust him after everything?,1
799,"That is true, but then again they put trust in Gen and how'd that turn out lol. I do get your point, maybe Hyoga will submit and secretly become a double agent to spy on Kingdom of Science. Who knows, I'm excited to see the next ep hahaha",1
800,"Gen is superficial as can be.    He literally said he turned sides for a cola.    A fucking.    Cola.    But then again, that's after he saw the electricity.",2
801,It's obviously not for a cola though. It's just a test to see if senku values him and has the smarts to actually make consistent progress.,1

820,Tsukasa will likely deduce that his force was defeated by Senku because a mere village wouldn't be able to repel his spear guy and it'll sound very fishy that Gen was not able to find Senku the first time. I don't think Gen can bullshit his way out again.,0

830,Isn't Tsukasa's thing to go full stone worldo with young people because older people are corrupt or whatever? Why is the whole gang he sent outside of maybe Hyoga like 30-40? Also why would Kinro have died if he fell from that height when two contestants in the tournament fell from likely the same height?,0
831,Then Hyoga would've fell too and probably kill him on the bottom just to make sure.,0
832,Probably because he had an open wound so the salt water would get in,2
833,5D stone warudo chess,2
834," If I was in Senku's place I would make something called   Sarin   or Sarin Nerve Gas. Let me tell you about this...    1- It can kill the enemy in less than 10 minutes    2- The symptoms appear in about 2 - 3 minutes    3- The enemy is completely unable to control his body when the symptoms appear    4- The enemy will suffer from  salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress, and emesis vomiting  and at the end it will lead to death.    It makes you go to what you might be going through a Seizure, and trust me it's scary I saw someone having a Seizure Paralysis before.    This gas is considered a weapon of mass destruction, and with Senku knowledge he could make it.    Before that let me tell you how it's done and the story behind how it was discovered.    In 1938 a German scientist was working on developing a new pesticides, specifically OrganoPhosphorous Pesticides Insecticides But   -get this-   He,   by accident   created 4 of the most toxic gas in the world!    They are called Nerve Agents In a series of gases called the G-Series The one I am talking about is:      Sarin Nerve Gas C4H10FO2P      That's it's chemical formula, as you can see we need Fluorine, Phosphor and the rest is easy to obtain.    F Florine is easy after mining minerals like Fluorite. Phosphor or Phosphorous is easily found in fertilizers Animal wastes.    With that we obtained a lot of things. Then we need a gas mask and a really isolated area from all people. We will also need clothes that won't let the gas reach our skin.    After that, it's just the processes of doing it, he must first make a pesticides called Methylphosphonyl Difluoride Then he mixes it with Alcohol specifically the isopropoxy group to the phosphorus with an alcoholysis with isopropyl alcohol to get two Identical pesticides called methylphosphonyl difluoride and methylphosphonic dichloride, Yeah one of them is the same as the last one. Then they get the same quantity of these 2 pestcides and put to gether to get:      Fluoro-methylphosphoryloxypropane; Phosphonofluoridic acid, P-methyl-, 1-methylethyl ester   Yes that's the same, it's Sarin!    This Gas works by Binding with an enzyme called AcetyleCholinEstrase.    To get a background clue there are these Neurotransmitters in your body that are responsible for many of things, one of them is AcetyleCholin ACh this neurotransmitter is responsible for your Muscles to Contract, It gets thrown in your synaptic cleft that sends signals to your muscles in brain to contract, but SOMETHING MUST STOP this neurotransmitter to do that, and so the AcetyleCholinEstrase is responsible for that.    Here comes Sarin gas, You inhaled it or it has touched your skin By the way this gas spread faster than water vapor and it just need a small quantity to kill you so yeah it spread fast and kill you fast, it's immediately react with AcetyleCholinEstrase and make it unable to stop AcetylCholin and thus Your muscles will contract and contract making you unable to move, the pain is immeasurable, and you start to asphyxiate till your death!    What happen to your body is the same when you have a seizure or a paralysis you basically can't control your body moments or breathing or sight or anything.    By the way the symptoms that you might run through while this gas has touched that time is.. a runny nose, tightness in the chest, and constriction of the pupils. Soon after, the person will have difficulty breathing and they will experience nausea and drooling. As they continue to lose control of bodily functions, they may vomit, defecate, and urinate. This phase is followed by twitching and jerking. Ultimately, the person becomes comatose and suffocates in a series of convulsive spasms.    But if someone managed to get out of it, there is no side effects he will be completely fine.    That's scary Boy. Senku should use this, he would 1000000% Billion percent win lmao!     he can develop a strong gas mask, or an Oxygen tank to breath independently.    About the safety measurements, I think he should produce the gas far far away from the village with extreme care and respect he could in fact do it but the risk too high to be honest...     That thing spread like nothing, the gas were used in animals who have 4 times stronger immunity to the gas and was still affected right after they inhaled some of it.    Senku could literally dress in protective clothes with a gas mask, and just about he sees someone he would just let the gas out, who ever has escaped is in terror and who ever inhaled the gas or even made a contact with it would die.    A protective wear must be washed because it also catch on the Gas, he could make a small place far away.    By the way the gas disappears after about a day in a closed area and hours if it's in the open air and turn into harmless gases.    He could use it to win though, it's the ultra finishing move!",0
835,"Calm down, satan.",1
836,I am just trying to help lmao,1
837,"It's like Goblin Slayer. The most effective and efficient way to deal against the enemies might not be the flashiest one.    Unfortunately, this is shounen so they wouldn't go as far as chemical warfare.",1
838,"Also Senku's not a mass murderer. And really, imagine what the villagers would start thinking of him if after the antibiotic and glasses their next taste of science was ""cloud of painful death"".    The whole idea of him being an evil sorcerer might resurface.",0
839,"He   could   use it to win but that'd be proving Tsukasa's point that not every one that was petrified needs to survive. Senku said he wants to save everybody, not only the believers of science.",1
840,"So, if senku can't kill anyone he can't win... But there's a method, if the Sarin gas is impure It look brownish and smell like mustard it doesn't kill the enemy if he was exposed to not so big dose of it it's paralyze them make them immobilized permanently, for about couple of hours Although in those couple of hours the enemy will suffers from extreme pain and many many bad things but in the end there won't be any effects remaining. and so they can capture them. a peaceful way but with pain to win... why I am so worked up to let Senku use this gas lmao I want to see it but it's terrifying to be aired on TV lmao.",1
841,"No way that's happening. The Japanese have a dark history with sarin nerve gas. In a show where the science is based on reality, it would be in extremely poor taste to feature a nerve gas that killed real life Japanese citizens.",0
842,"You mean that terrorist who killed 13 people in the subway by Sarin Nerve Gas.  Probably not lmao, I am just joking but it's the ultra finishing move to Tsukasa.  Hmm, You're right I didn't see a Hollywood movie that features 911 so it makes sense.  Although I know for a fact that there are another Nerve Agents such as VX nerve gas, it's a lot more Toxic than Sarin but it doesn't spread faster. there is also the gases from the G-series like Tabun, Soman and Cyclosarin.   I wonder why I know all of these lol.",1
843,I wonder as well. Better clear your Google search history before you end up on a list Hi FBI!,1
844,"I know these from a past research so I am safe for now lol.  I did make a lot of things, no traces of the FBI going behind me. oh these things are just minor things like a Hybrid Rocket Engine and APCP Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant.. etc etc basically Explosive stuff.   Hi FBI, you ready yet?",1
845,"They have an entire lake filled with Sulfuric Acid and glass bottles now. All I can think about is how fucked a person would be if they got smacked in the face with a Sulfuric Molotov with no proper medical treatments. Think about it, All that exposed skin and fleshy bits like the eyes.",0
846,"I mean that's pretty effective but if Senku was outnumbered he might be too slow at throwing these although he can launch them from far away or maybe they will know and hence retreat. Although your Idea is pretty interesting. it's easy to get Sulfuric acid since they know where the lake was. pretty easy I would say.  Still Sarin work a lot better, it's odorless, colorless and fast at killing people.",1
847,"You don't even need to get that far. Do you know what the most effective distance weapons were for most of history? Not bows, not spears, but slingshots. Those things can literally kill you in one hit and don't require a developed physique. They use rocks as ammunition and can be built using a twig and some rope.",0
848,and he can launch glass spheres filled with sulfuric acid instead,2
849,too expensive,2
850,Not really. He has like dozens of big glass jars and chemistry gear.,1
851,"yes, lets resort to chemical warfare immediately s",1
852,He would win though...,1
853,he needs gas masks for everyone cause that shit's gonna spread to the entire village.,2
854,Jesus christ that's op. Tsukasa would be destroyed in seconds.,0
855,"Yeah, an all his army.. whoever managed to escape is in terror and will probably surrender. And whoever was effected, well he would be dead lol.",0
856,too dangerous.,0
857,     TFW you just try to protect your garden but end up killing your whole neighbourhood.,0
858,Who's the VA for Hyouga? Sounds super familiar,1
859,"Maybe this would help    “Hyouga ja nai, Katsura da!”      if it didn’t then the answer would be Akira Ishida  ",1
860,"Zura!    Ohhh it's also the one who voiced Izana from Akagami no Shirayuki hime that I rewatched recently, as well as Cavendish",0
861,"He’s also the voice of Gaara, Zeref, and apparently a Cancer Cell",0
862,Definitely edgy.,1
863,"Oh, Akira Ishida's voicing him too? Dude's got two roles this season, huh? One being GabrielVecta in SAO.",2
864,Also Byakuya from Danganronpa.,2
865,Wow this episode is so amazing !!!!!    The invasion sure was fast. Tsukasa's army are full of monsters    Senku don't be so harsh on Ginro haha    Those Japanese Katanas are so badass !    Suika is the best girl     I'm so excited for the next episode :,1
866,it was bearable before the emojis but cool,1
867,Are they now going to cut their achilles tendons and turn them into slaves?,0
868,"Sadly, this is a shounen anime.",0
869,"Ok, are they going to use the power of friendship to force them into slav  cough  friendship?",1
870,"No, they'll use the power of S C I E N C E.",0
871,"Senku makes LSD, reproduces the MK Ultra program.",2
872,"I love Gen tbh, his smug face is hilarious lmao.",1
873,"I relate to Senku whenever he does  his  smug face.    I don't know much about chemistry, but some of the things sound pretty familiar from ""How It's Made"" and I gotta give both shows credit.",1
874,"I love just how smart this show is. Every part of the story makes sense, and they take the time to explain it. Nothing in this show feels like it comes out of nowhere. And the idea to make katanas? Brilliant. Cant wait to see where it goes",1
875,Loving Gen's face. Floriography = Language of Flowers kek,1
876,I was just saying over and over again for the kingdom of science to just kill the invaders. I hope they don't just let them go...,0
877,Loving the adaptation so far. This was a major plot point for gen to finally transition into full time science team. By pacing id say this will end at the final showoff. Rest assured the show will 1 billion % get renewed and theres enough chapters for a full second season already.,1
878,I don't think I'm holding back from the manga with this one. I love the show so much and everyone says the manga is a 1010.,1
879,"Kinro stabs Minion  1 in the face with his spear. Minion  1 "" He broke my nose!!!""...     Gen placing flowers for Suika to follow.  Hyoga ""Hey Gen, why are you carrying hundreds of flowers and dropping them behind us??""....     Magma gets cut all over the place, and at the end of the episode not a scratch on him also kinro's stab wound ....     All Jokes aside about Shounen. I love this show. Another great episode!!!",0
880,"I have some SERIOUS problems with the first part of that episode. Namely that Hyoga stood there that entire time with Kinro hanging on to him while Ginro was having his breakdown and Senku was making a fake gun and then he sat there and fucking WATCHED GEN TALKING TO THEM, SIGNAL MAGMA, AND MAGMA THROW THE ROCK AND SOMEHOW STILL BOUGHT THAT SHIT. Then on top of it he just fucking leaves and then it cuts to Kohaku lifting up Ginro who is only hanging FROM HER, not from the bridge. The fuck was he doing that entire time, did he just let go of Hyoga, hang off the fucking bridge for like a minute, and then just let go of it while hanging on to Kohaku, only to grab it again to climb up? Also totally minor nit-pick, they only ever showed 3 goons the entire episode but in that final shot they suddenly showed 5 or 6.    Also I thought Tsukasa was only reviving young people because he thought old people ruined the old world? Is he okay with older people cuz they're muscleheads, or are they supposed to somehow still be young? All the burly dudes besides Hyoga look into their 30s at least.    Aside from that, great episode. I honestly thought I was gonna absolutely hate Gen when he was introduced in part cuz I expected him to be a Loki kinda character who would constantly be backstabbing everyone but I absolutely love him now. Also never woulda guessed Old Man Kohaku was a decent warrior. Huh.",1
881,That's a problem that comes with adapting a manga to anime form.    It's hard to convey that those panels and moments you read one after the other are supposed to be happening simultaneously.,0
882,     Laugh's in JoJo,2
883,"     Gen was too far away to hear, and they could have not noticed the rock before the ""gunshot"", like how it's hard to see where a golf ball is just after the club hits it.         yes.         back goons.         former?",1
884,"It's worth pointing out, this scene took place in the middle of the night, so while we could see what was happening, it likely would have been hard for someone 100ft away to see what was happening, especially with a torch between them.",1
885,"i feel like if senku really wants to win he  should  stop focusing on weapons and just start making really bad ass technology that even the brutes cant refuse like the coca cola or the ramen.     ;    ""....but Tsukasa....they have Smartphones...and TV....I wanna live there.""",1
886,"Truth to be told, he's only making weapons to defend the village and deter the Tsukasa Empire from attacking. Senku is clearly not interested in killing anyone, his goal is saving all of humanity, return civilization to its current height, and go past that.",1
887,"i know im just thinking he could use gen i guess not anymore but he couldve spied on them and seen what all they wanted and just give them something they couldnt live without, make senku's knowledge unexpendable",2
888,"At this point, he has to defeat Tsukasa to save humanity because he and senku have opposing ideals.",1
889,  condoms,2
890,"Ummm, I’ve watched this episode 3 times already now",2
891,Kinro took to the four-eyes persona very quickly.,2
892,Oh god it is Demon Slayer all over again,1
893,Bruh imagine Inosuke in dr. Stone lol dude would fit right in,1
894,But this one got a swole Dwarf smith and frisky girls,1
895,The katana maker guy would've dove into the water for that lost sword,0
896,He needs to be a little bit more playful but I got strong Ichimaru Gin vibes from Hyoga.,1
897,"If Hyoga and Gen fused, that would be Gin in a nutshell. ""Those are proper, strong eyes"".",1
898,"Who the hell are these mooks that Tsukasa has revived? Is he so hard for his stone-tech only civilization that he's sacrificed his ideals to get it?    He's not gonna be able to control these people as he expands. They're pretty clearly interested in violence, probably only going along with Tsukasa's utopia because it gets that violence. The instant they are out of his range they're gonna turn on themselves to gather resources and power for themselves.    That conflict will create a force for innovation, and they already know the very rough path civilization took before, each step they take gives them an advantage over their slower neighbors and an absolute advantage over Tsukasa.",0
899,That OST was  this episode,2
900,I'm not liking the fact that they're not killing their enemies. The tournament was more brutal.,0
901,"Oh shit! It is getting lit now.    This is the first time I really like Gen. Was still a tiny bit nervous he might betray Senkuu. That ending with him was dope.    I never really loved Taiju and Yuzuriha, but man do I want to see them again. I have to think when the news reaches Tsukasa that Senkuu is alive, won't he realize they are traitors for lying? I hope we see them join the kingdom of science soon!",1
902,"Very good episode, and very funny.",1
903,"The Tsukasa Empire doesn't make much sense to me. So, he's reviving all the strong people he can find. But he can't guarantee that all the people he revives won't want science. No matter how power craven you are, there's no denying the fact that you'd rather live with technology than without. Can't wait for the first cholera outbreak lol.",1
904,"The entire point is that Tsukasa doesn't understand that fact.    He doesn't understand the fact that even if everyone on Earth right now is a ""good person"", there's never a guarantee that the next generation follows.",1
905,"Yeah, Tsukasa is crazy, but he can’t guarantee that every person he wakes up is that way.",1
906,Tsukasa has a dim view of modern medicine.,2
907,love when the old dude busted his clothes. someone was still peeking! ahahaha!,1
908,I was 100% expecting him to make Tower Shields and go Roman on their asses.,2
909,The greatest weapon.,1
910,"For some reason, just now I realized how absolutely excellent Senkus VA is. He just clicked with the character so good I didn't even realize it. Mad props to him.",1
911,"Such a satisfying adaptation of the manga, not necessarily full of sakuga moments int the animation, but perfectly translating the humour, themes and hype from the manga.",1
912,Hyoga giving out some serious Gin Ichimaru vibes.,1
913,"Funny how the depetrified modern Japanese look far more like Stone Worlders than the actual Stone Worlders do.    Kinro definitely thrust at the first attacker with the pointy end of the spear, so how was it that the blunt end made the contact??    Why exactly would a storm mean matchlocks are useless? Just cover them and the gunpowder with something so they dont get wet or blown out, problem solved.    ""Japanese katanas!"" Unlike those other katanas I guess. I like how they somehow have no issue cutting through stone.",1
914,"Now is the time everyone! If ever you were unsure about getting into this anime, now is the time to give it a try!    Watch up until this current episode. If you don’t see what’s so awesome about this anime by the most recent episode then go ahead and give it up. But I doubt that will be the case.     I, for one, am very excited now about the future of this anime. Hype has gone from 7 to 10!",1
915,"So does the Kingdom of Science have iron or steel weapons? Since steel is just an alloy of iron and carbon, it seems like a small procedural change that would have a high benefit.",1
916,"It was a lot more difficult to create steel with primitive technology than wrought iron. It would take much longer than 3 days to not only make the steel, but then make it into weapons; especially with the low-quality iron found in Japan",0
917,"Pure iron is not a thing in practice; metallurgy process actually usually mean carbon is  added  to iron, so much that you need to remove it in order to get steel. That's pretty much, I think, what the folding and beating process is for.    So, assuming they started from pig iron the type found in Japan, and why katanas were made the way they were, then it's steel, albeit not of great quality and likely with a high carbon content.",0
918,Why did Senku pass the small blade to Gen and then pass it back to him? Is Gen the one cutting the tip of Hyoga's spear?,0
919,Yes.,1
920,"I'm pretty sure that moment was a flashback.    Gen is out with the enemy, just before the festival.    Suika gets tasked to deliver a pocket knife and succeeds.    Gen uses the pocket knife to cut the spear.    Gen comments about the spear.    Flashback ends.",1

923,No! That would prove Tsukasa right!,0

926,Gotta say I love this show. It's been a struggle avoiding the manga.,1

935,"     It isn't so much he thinks Gen is lying. Gen said he didn't see a body, so Tsukasa is working on the assumption that isn't conclusive proof Senku is dead; so he wants to take over the Villagethat Gen now told him about before a maybe-alive Senku can get there.",0
936,"     It's a trick, but it's not that the spear telescopes, the front grip of the spear is a hollow bamboo tube that's not physically connected to the spear shaft. This means he can hold onto the bamboo tube with his full strength and exert maximum torque onto the spear shaft, while still letting him rapidly slide the spear back and forth which without the bamboo tube would be impossible due to the friction from his hand.",1
937,"I understand the mechanic.  I mean telescopes as in the sleeve gives it room to move around, so he can change his grip on the fly as well as spin it.  Its a fairly common accessory in tools for getting better range of grip, so ive seen them in modern times a number of times in construction tools and stuff.  I knew they were used in weapons of old but hadnt really seen that concept ever used in anything.  So was just neat to see the guy and understand his trick instantly because of modern use.",1

Tsukasa has no reason to sit on his ass if what appears to be his wing man disappears into thin air but Yuzuriha and Taiju are already in it risking their lives. That's the whole point since the start, that they're either gonna be a big revolving door for some grand scheme, or die before it happens. The audience already understands that. Senku understands and accepted that. Taiju and Yuzuriha got that too. They are acting with that knowledge in mind, and there is nothing Senku could do in this situation to stop them outside of convincing a guy who's so loyal to Tsukasa and so high in the pyramid of his new regime that he got custom magic bamboo thrusters when the goons get stone hatchets.",2

955,link pls too lazy,0
956,Man these guys attacked way faster than I would have expected and the guy with the spear is really good. Well its good that Senkuu and Gen were able to stop the guy with the spear but if they get away senkuu lose a spy. Good to see the return of detective Suika.,1

969,this show is so dope and the facial expressions and comedic moments work for me and i don’t usually lol to anime humour. gen is growing on me that little two faced bastard. him and senku can probably think of a legitimate reason that tsukasa cant or shouldnt cast gen out just yet. and if this wasnt a shounen id swear the op is foreshadowing senkus death but its likely just the passing off of knowledge.,1

981,I'm a bit dissapointed with the villains. They look like generic henchman when Tsukasa has limited himself to intact Japanese teenagers in walking distance who I guess look strong.     I also don't like that the spear needed to be sabotaged. I liked that it just falls apart because he made it using inferior tools. Or just chips when encountering a metalwork blade.

I've been and continue to be surprised by how little actual progress in technology this show makes. Every small progression seems to take forever but then once they make that achievement suddenly they have that ""thing"" on tap and can reproduce it practically at will. It took them what...? Three episodes to make one iron rod but then they make five katana's in thirty seconds. It also seems like there are so many tangents to actual progression... I just find this show very frustrating.    I don't want Senku to pretend he has a gun when the bad guys come for him I want him to have a repeating gatlin gun that scares them so badly they run, hide, and never come out until Senku is completely done restoring all of humanity. I don't really care about the ""War Of The Flies"" shit. I just want to see one smart guy drag humanity out of the stone age and at this rate I seriously doubt that's going to happen.",0
1013,They don't have any more gun powder. He could whip up a gun in minutes if he had enough to make it worth using.,0
1014,But he can't make more gun powder because reasons.,1
1015,They lack proper nitric acid. This is like their reoccurring resource gap.,1
1016,But it's a contrived resource gap. In other words the gap exists not for practical reasons but because the author decided the gap must exist because heshe needs it to exist to serve the plot. Contrivance has never been a friend to good storytelling. And if the reason that Senku can't make more gunpowder is obviously contrived while at the same time Senku has the ability to make Katana's in a matter of hours it comes off as sloppylazy storytelling.    And that was my point.,1
1017,"I don't know, depending on the tools available, nitric acid could be very hard to source. I haven't heard anyone give a complete breakdown of how they could make more using their likely options.",0
1018,Considering the knowledge Senku has and the resources available the Ostwald Process probably wouldn't be that difficult for him to make happen. Chrome has collected many resources that could be used as a base metal for the process and we know they have an ample supply of ammonia.     But there are like 5 different historical ways to create nitric acid. The wikipedia page on it in the history section goes into detail on them but it should suffice to say that with Senku's already displayed knowledge of chemistry the acquisition of nitric acid is indeed a contrivance by the author and there is no practical reason for him being short on it.,1
1019,"The Ostwald process requires certain chemical catalysts that  might  be difficult to source.     I'm not discounting the possibility that he has at least one option available, I just haven't heard anyone be able to list one that he would  definitely  have the tools to complete, given what we know or can assume about his surroundings.",1
1020,"That's the problem with things like Chrome's ""collection"" and in a larger way the show in general and you're really tapdancing around it.     The author can, and has, pulled whatever heshe has needed out of Chrome's collection. The chances that Chrome doesn't have gold, platinum, or one of the other base metals and they are all much easier to smelt than steel if he just has the ore seem slim considering the things he's collected already. The lead galena Senku mentioned a large basket of galena which is the ore for lead alone tends to show up around gold ore. Additionally Chrome's criteria for collection seemed to follow 1 Is it useful. 2 Is it shinypretty. 3 Is it somehow unique or rare. considering the collection he had. And things like Gold and Platinum would fall under several of those categories.     But ultimately we're arguing over minutia. I can make some reasonable inferences about what Senku and Chrome should have available to them and support those inferences with things that have been shown in the show already, but ultimately the problem with the collection and the show in general is that it's a lazy plot devicecontrivance in which the author just pulls out whatever heshe needs to keep the story going and denies things that might cause the story to develop in another way. It's convenient for the author to deny Senku gunpowder because the author wants Senku and the village to be at a disadvantage to the martial power of the attackers. But the reasoning for them to be at a disadvantage is poorly executed and doesn't feel genuine  because  the author hasn't gone to any narrative lengths to explain why Senku would be at such a disadvantage.     In fact the author is writing circles around this problem by using up ""the last of the gunpowder"" and then pretending that the explosives won't work in the rain and all of that comes about because for whatever reason the author didn't want Senku to use any of the MANY, MANY other available methods that were demonstrably available to him from things already shown in the show to defend the village so that he could write a sword fight with Katana's.     It's lazy, sloppy writing and it takes focus from the ""advance of the kingdom of science"" away so that, what should have been an immediate and one sided battle in favor of Senku ends up being a lengthy, mutli-episode battle with katanas made in an unreasonable fraction of time against a spear guy with a stone spear who's supposedly so badass that he can take on all those better armed people and the only way to defeat him was to out their spy.     Your arguing against how contrived this all is makes me analyze the show and the more I do so the more problems I find and the less I like it so I'm going to stop now. Because I've already put so much time into the show I'm going to see how the season ends. Crunchroll dumped a truckload of money into the show so I won't be surprised if it gets another season. But it won't get another season based on merit or quality. It will be a business decision based on investment made and an effort to recover more profit. The show itself is lazy and told I can't speak to the Manga or any LN's that may exist poorly. There was a way to do this amazing premise and be clever about it. This just wasn't it.",0
1021,"Platinum is a relatively rare metal, not equally distributed, and not particularly ""showy"" in its natural state.     Yes, Chrome's collection  could  have just about anything, but realistically it would only be materials local to the southern Kanto region, within a day or two's walk of the village, and something that would be immediately appealing. To the best of my knowledge, there is no platinum mining in Japan, so any occurance of it would be trace, at best, and practically invisible if you didn't know what you were looking for.     As he noted in the most recent dubbed broadcast episode, he didn't collect silica sand because he didn't see a value in it, so he wouldn't have  every  material.          True enough, their progress is designed around the needs of the story, but also by reasonable material limitations. It's not like they tend to just completely ignore easily available options, so it may be a plot-convenient coincidence that they don't have the materials they need to make gunpowder, but  also  it's a perfectly reasonable reality to their situation, so why get bothered by it?         The last bit was just because they didn't  have  any gunpowder. He wanted to be able to convince Hyoga that they still had the threat of guns, but didn't have the means to actually do it. It's like how in WWII the British army built massive tank battalions out of wood, so that from above it looked like they had a huge force ready to invade, but really they only had a fraction of that, and this caused the Germans to deploy in advantageous ways. Trickery is a good thing in war.    I don't think that it was  just  to ""make katanas,  I think if anything his primary goal was that he didn't want to get into a shooting war, so that's what he wrote the plot around, and then katanas were his immediate solution to the problem of not using guns. The point of the story is not to produce the most efficient killing machines possible, but rather to use clever tactics to  out think  the enemy.    Also, remember that gunpowder is not the primary use of nitric acid in the show. If they had it in easy supply, not only could they make gunpowder yawn, they could also wake up hundreds of sleeping Japanese people, who could really level the odds. But establishing nitric acid as the key component of the revival fluid in the first chapters, they made it an essential ""limited resource.""         It makes perfect sense that Hyoga could be way stronger than them. He is using presumably the end of thousands of years of martial arts skills, developed in practical warfare between dozens of cultures. It's a tech tree of its own, and he has all sorts of skills at his disposal. It's really a bit of a miracle that these villagers would have any real combat skills at all, given that they don't really have warfare, and at most would be having duels to learn practical skills.         Probably a good idea. No show can withstand too much nit picking.          Yes it will, because you aside, most people really love the show. Your opinion is not a fact.",1
1022,     You're clearly forgetting that the island the astronauts landed on was so far away from the mainland that they couldn't get there on their own. Additionally the island moved closer to the mainland in the almost four thousand years since everyone was frozen due to tectonic plate movement and continental drift.     To put it simply the southern Kanto region isn't anywhere near the southern Kanto region. And considering we have no idea what has happened to the world in the almost 4k year since everyone was petrified there's no way to know where they are now or for that matter what volcanic or tectonic activity may have brought what elements to the surface.          Yet they had no problem getting silica sand because the author deemed it expedient.         Because it isn't perfectly reasonable because they are ignoring easily available options.          I disagree that I've been giving it too much nit picking. These are things that take me out of the story and fail to allow me to suspend disbelief. That's not my fault as a viewer.         But what is a fact is that the blue ray sales aren't great and the show has failed to inspire manga sales. Which means it usually would not see a second season.,0
1023,"                 No, that's not how any of that works. An island would only move feet over that time, not miles, and not in that direction. They are nowhere near that island right now.    We've even seen Japan from above, in the episode with the lightbulb.         We have a pretty fair idea of what impacts would occur over that period. Even if a local volcano erupted, it would deposit chemicals roughly similar to what they have in the area today, and any volcanoes super far away would only distribute basic ash in minute quantities, heavy metals would fall out way closer to the eruption. I suppose an unusual meteor could strike or something, but that would be a billion times convenient, and one of the worst plot contrivances in the show if that was their justification.          Because it's relatively common. It's reasonable to assume it's around. The point is, things that are reasonable to have around, should be assumed to be around. Things that are more rare in nature, need more detailed explanations.          And  again,  I have yet to hear anyone lay out one of these ""perfectly reasonable options."" The Oswald process is not one, given the limitations I pointed out.          In this case, it kinda is. Too much over-analyzing can break pretty much any script.          I don't know about that. It's popular overseas, and I think aims for a different market than some anime, more youth-oriented, so maybe their blueray sales are a smaller part of their production budget.",1
1024,Clearly we're not going to agree. Personally I think there are a lot of much better written shows that deserve 2nd or 3rd seasons over DS. My personal feelings aside the sales reflect its lack of popularity in Japan and Japanese anime makers rather famously don't give a shit about foreign interests in their work. So if DS does see a second season it will be despite the normal situation in which it wouldn't... almost assuredly due to the involvement of Crunchtroll in its production.,1
1025,"Maybe so. The point is, the audience is there for the show, since the NA audience seems to enjoy it. It seems to compete with My Hero Academia in Japan, and that series is going strong. If Shokugeki no Soma could get a 4th season after the reaction to the last manga arc, then I don't see why Dr. Stone wouldn't get one. I think that you're just grasping for reasons why it should fail because you don't want it to succeed. Can't we just leave it with ""I don't enjoy it much?""",1
1026,"No we can't. Because it's not a matter of taste. As much as you'd like to dismiss my complaints as such there are real, substantive problems with the show and it fails in a number of ways to achieve decent storytelling. These are technical issues not matter of taste. And were I to allow you to be able to point to my concerns and say ""he just doesn't like the show"" that would be a misleading falsehood.",0
1027,"     You say ""it's not a matter of personal taste,"" and then you go on to say ""As much as you'd like to dismiss my personal taste as such there are real, substantive problems with the way my personal tastes interact with the show and it fails in a number of ways to achieve decent storytelling, according to my personal tastes.""     There are not objective things you are relating, they are aspects of your own personal taste. You do not  like  how it does a certain thing, that does not make it objectively  wrong  that it does them that way, and a different viewer can take in those exact same aspects and have a positive reaction to them. Given that the series is almost always in the top 1-5 slot among Jump series, and that most people reacting to it seem generally favorable, I think there's sufficient evidence that they are not reacting to the series the same way that you are.     That's ok.          But most of what you've pointed out as ""technical issues"" are not, such as you seemed to be working under the misunderstanding that the village was on the island from the flashback, when it is not, or that they would be able to use the Oswald process, when they could not. You've repeatedly cited that they should be able to make as much nitric acid as they need, but when asked repeatedly for an example of how they could acquire some, you were unable to provide one that would work.     Every argument you have made seems to fit the theory of ""I do not like the show, therefore it must have flaws to it, so this must be a flaw, and this must be a flaw,"" and so on, rather than ""I do not like this show, therefore  I  do not have to watch it, but plenty of other people really enjoy it,  and they are not in any way less correct than I am.""     Roll that latter one around a bit, see if you can make it fit.",1

Tsukasa just wants to rule over a new stone world - restoringadvancing civilization isn't important to him.    The katana thing was pretty awesome. I love when Senku shows up with something surprising and beats the crap out of everyone. MVP to Kinro for being a stand up guy and willing to put his life out to save the village.

And besides, people who have fought with spears their whole lives aren't going to become fighting gods when they get swords. It would have made much more sense to have made better spears or other kinds of polearms for the village. Naginata if it  has  to be Japanese. Or how about bows? Senku already made a crossbow so we know that he's capable, the attackers would be defenseless against arrows or bolts on that bridge.

It's not a matter of being better than stone, Senku outright says that ""Katanas are the best swords in the world.""     This feeds into people thinking that European swords were crude, dull and heavy while a Katana is a weapon that can cut right through plate armor. That's a lie that's been propagated for far too long. Even I used to believe it.     Also someone I saw in the comments said that European swordsmen had to be jacked for the same performence implying that they're way heavier when they're actually usually less than 2 kilos     This shows that this isn't a made up problem.",0

But of course, how dare I complain about misinformation in an anime that has been nothing if not informative until now.

Also making a bunch of katanas can't be faster than making a whole lot of spearheads, right?",1
