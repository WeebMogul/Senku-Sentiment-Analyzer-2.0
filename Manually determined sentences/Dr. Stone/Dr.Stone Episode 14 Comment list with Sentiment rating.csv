0,"For those who finally break down and wish to read the manga, this episode covered up to ch. 38.",1
1,"I started reading the manga a few episodes back, and I completely forgot how early into the manga the anime is. At this rate, the show could go on for another season before catching up to the manga, depending on how they adapt the next arcs.",2
2,"It's a shounen, many of the panels later on don't take much space in animation form. Rough rate of 4 chapters per episode with 10 episodes this season remaining means 40 more chapters or so will be covered.     ""I'd guess they will end on the conclusion of the stone war arc. Up to Ch. 78.""",0

6,"  Original comment by ufireglz |  Top-level comment     ---    They added a bit from the source material, but it was all really tastefully doneLike Senku's calculation..

7,"Dayum, there was a lot of kinda-spoilers in the new OP but was subtle enough that you can easily overlook it as nice visuals.      From the looks of the new OP, they’re covering more than I thought they would. Seems like it might reach to the point where  and plays the glass music disc.",1

11,"Summary of this totally honest and fair tournament:    - match 1: won by attacking the opponent from behind while he was talking with the referee to settle a matter of external interference  - match 2: fixed to hasten the beginning of match 3  - match 3: won by default thanks to one player being occupied with an engineered distraction  - match 4: won by doping  - match 5: won by setting the opponent on fire    This is probably the dirtiest TOURNAMENT ARC of any shonen, ever.",1

119,Yep. And I'm gonna miss singing along to the end song too...,1
120,"It’s not that they’re bad, but the new oped are really disappointing in comparison.",0
121,"I enjoyed the new op, especially the visuals. The ED was an eh for me.",1
122,I liked the song for the old OP more but I like the visuals better on the new one. I agree with you that the ED is a solid eh,1
123,The Ed is amazing as a song. I can't get enough of it personally.,1
124,I think the song is good but the visuals are way too generic in the second one.,1
125,Visuals for the new OP are stellar,2
126,the Ed is so good for me because of the scenes with senku + mysterious person that i know because it's a manga spoiler.,1
127,I dunno there was just something special about the first OPEDs Maybe these will grow on me some more,1
128,"with long running shows like this, the first oped are typically their strongest showing, then they break out the B material. Not that it's bad either, but you've also gotten so used to the old one that the new ones don't sound nearly as good in comparison.",1
129,I guess bleach is the outlier where the first 4 are probably some of the best OPs ever.,1
130,More shows should do what Log Horizon did and stick with what works.,2
131,It's almost always the case. People love first OPED more until new ones grow on them.,1
132,"While I think the first opening was better just as straight music I think the new one fits the series better, its closer to a mystery series than a standard shonen, at least its supposed to be. The first OP was hype as hell but didn't fit with the ""action"" going on in the series imo",0

134,Not like this.. frustration,1
135,Guitar rift intensifies!,2
136,It'll be back for a climactic moment in the last or second to last episode,2
137,Nah. Probably one of the shittiest songs honestly,0
138,new op feels like its twice the size of the old one,1
139,"Goddamnit, I'm still gonna hum it on my own... and none of you can stop me!    Also, quick question; why do anime change the OPED so much? There are some songs that should just   stick   no matter what. I'm lookin' at   you  , 'W ind' by Akeboshi. ",0
140,The first op is alway best,1
141,"Ikr, tho during this opening I was kinda getting into despite only hearing it for the first time",2
142,Gotta wait for the Blu-rays,2
143,"its not censored, those are his pubes",1
144,Oh god the idea of trimming the pubes wasn’t passed on?,1
145,You're supposed to trim pubes?,2
146,"Well for girls, trimming the bush so it doesn’t get caught on articles of clothing or the folds of the genitalia which can get painful is always a good idea. For guys it’s less important but it does make your junk look bigger. Completely optional depending on your hair growth rate.",1
147,"Good point on some of the advantage of less or no bush.   Shaving the pubes on women came in Ancient Greece, statues indicates that was also done much earlier in Sumatra and the Romans continued it at least till they went Christian. Note Greek and Roman Statues have pubic hair on men but not women. Ancient Egypt both sexes shaved everything including the head and wore wigs just in public if status demanded to be cooler in that always hot place.  Statue in Pompai from India shows shaving the pubes even in India.  Along with skirts with no underwear and no hair to trap moisture in the vagina infections would be way less common also. There is actually a practical reason for women wearing skirts even with pubes if no underwear it does lower infections just like nudity does.     Read long article in Wall Street Journal in early 90's that predicted based on past history that completely shaving would come in fashion and probably last for hundreds of years probably requiring a fall of civilization to end. At that time fairly large landing strips the limit of shaving except for the tiny amount of women who completely shave who can be found in all times of history and their are a few pictures of this even in the 50's and before. Shaving prevents crabs and lice so probably this why mostly found in swingers and prostitutes.",0

159,"Seeing as divers in high-diving competition apparently jump from around the 22-27 meter range and the record height is 58.8 meters he's probably not gonna die from it unless the water is shallow. There better be a life guard around just to make sure though, from 20 meters and up it does tend to get risky, especially since he was clearly not prepared for the dive.",1
160,"rule  1 in fiction. Falls only hurt if you land on the ground. you can land on garbage bags, small piles of hay, water. those little canopies outside buildings will automatically slow your fall enough so that you don't get hurt",0

186,Absolute perfection.,1
187,"A little late to the party, but here's a cleaned up attempt. Gen Shadow Bind Jutsu.    Too bad the original Shikamaru image was low res. I could redo the hand sign in illustrator as a vector image, but that's a bit too much effort for now...",1
188,You did great work tbh.,1
189,"     Those are mudras, ritual hand gestures in some Eastern religions.  In modern Japanese media, they're used sort of like a Buddhist version of ""abracadabra"", so they show up a lot without being references.",1
190,"Well, I learned something interesting today: The Karana Mudra, which was thought to expel evil, is identical in both form and purpose to an Italian hand gesture commonly referred to as the ""devil horns"". Because  of course  a wiki walk starting in this sub would somehow lead me to Dio.",0

213,"He already ruled it the melon mask as a piece of clothing though, so he'd have to go back on his own word. And besides, after his sly little grin when he saw Chrome won I don't think he's gonna pull any favors for Magma.",1
214,Agreed. I honestly think no one in the village was hoping for Magma to win except Mantle,1
215,I mean Magma doesn't seem quiet with his plan to murder their Priestess after they get married. I'm nore annoyed that this society is giving him a chance to be their leader.,0
216,Rule ga rule da,2

235, touche,2
236,"Ehh if you think about it it wasn't really BS, Magma never actually forfeited the match, he just said it was over line accurate to the manga which was technically true.",1
237,Referee was probably looking for an opening to disqualify Magma anyway after his earlier unsportsmanlike victory.,2
238,"He ruled the  mask , but not the  glasses .    I'm basically bracing for the use of sand, sun, or glass being grounds for disqualification. I need to see the next episode to clear the air. I'm preparing myself for another twist.",1
239,"Jasper already ruled it Chrome's victory, so this guy, who's shown to be sympathetic to Chrome, hates magma, wants the best for Ruri, & hasn't gone back on his word would have to betray all that. & even if they  did  want to call it cheating, they have, Gen, a master manipulator, & Kohaku, who everyone trusts, to back Chrome up.",1
240,"Like I said, I need one more episode to clear things up.",1
241,"Chrome's already been declared the winner, though. And it wasn't outside interference if he was just using something that was lying around in the ring from the start.",1
242,"I mean, it was already on the battlefield at that point. It wasn't really outside interference, just making use of the environment, just like the pocket sand.",2
243,The mask was on the floor at that point. Magma could have grabbed it and done the same thing. It's fair game.,1
244,"There wasn't any rule against using sorcery, just outside interference.  As long as the sorcery came from Chrome it's allowed.",2
245,well everyone in the village knows Chrome as a sorcerer so they'll just think it was his magic,1
246,"Nah, their goal is advancing science in the village.  They can just show them how they did it and explain how it works.  Especially now that Chrome will be in charge, they shouldn't need to worry too much about mystifying it.",1
247,But then it could disqualify Chrome because he used an outside weaponattack,2
248,"It was already in the arena when the fight started.  Given that they didn't clear the arena between fights, I think they'll be fine.  No different than throwing sand that was in the arena in Magma's face.",0
249,Magma just burst into flames for no apparent reason. How is that Chrome's fault? It's not like anyone there except Magma actually believes in sorcery.,0

262,"Ah yes, i had forgotten about the luckiest grapes in   manga   now anime history.",1
263,We finally get the hottest panty shot of the season,2
264,I'm gonna be honest. I was happy that I had forgotten that. You made me remember it. And now I suffer.,1
265,This is not exhilarating,0
266,It shouldn't get one millimeter of attention,2
267,1o billion percent not cool,0
268,"Figured you were talking about the OP, clicked it, now must bleach my eyes.",2
269,Lewd.,2
270,That is bad civilization,0
271,Fan service in anime is really getting out of hand smh my head,1
272,"not really, we did have a beautiful panty shot in the animal molestor anime.",1
273,"Course it wasn't gonna be  that  easy. But the way it was won in the end was pretty neat with Gen's tricks and everything else.      And I think you chowed down the wrong kind of herbs there Ginro, making you hallucinate like that...",1
274,"Aye, it was very satisfying for me, too.    I guess next episode Ginro will start training with Hamon, yeah?",1
275,Chrome to overcome enemies stronger than them. No jobbing of side characters followed by MC power creeps.      mug8,0
276,"Also, he protected Suika's galsses, so he's a gentleman too!",1
277,Indeed. a bit.,2
278,"I was thinking it will just have a placebo effect on him since he was only eating the raw materials. Senku even said that it's better not to tell him so the ""placebo effect"" won't came off.     Having a bad stomach after that was hilarious though lol",1
279,I think Senku was telling them not to mention the impending side effects so Ginro could live in blissful ignorance for a few more minutes.,1
280,very cute the way they won and how everyone in the village wholesomely joined together for their hatred for Magma to completely ignore the random outsider that freely walked into the village and started casting curses,1
281,                ,2
282,Would be funny if Chrome collapses afterward and Ginro ended up winning the tournament,1
283,I'm something of a science user myself.,2
284,"Yeah, they often sneak memes into this anime, really nice.",1
285,ATATATTATATA! I understood that reference!,2
286,"FUCK YEAH! Great episode. Chrome is going to win the tournament! His ship with Ruri will sail!    I like the new OP and ED! This is kind of a hot take, but I never cared for the old OP or ED. I am pumped we got new ones. I really think they are better.    Can't wait to see what happens next week. I get the feeling Senkuu's parents un-petrified early on and that is how Ruri knows about him. If this is the case, it is going to be very emotional when Senkuu realizes they are dead. I will also be very sad.",0
287,"I dunno, chrome looks like he’s about to pass out, so Senku might win by default, but I don’t see him getting married to Ruri, too out of character for him",1
288,"That would honestly be such a funny turn of events if Senkuu married her. No way it happens, but it definitely would be a surprise!",1
289,"Agree with you 1,000,000,000% about the OPs and EDs.",1
290,I'm ten billion percent sure that you missed a zero.,2
291,"Don't forget he still has to get over Ginro.  Science wins either way, but who gets the girl?  No way Ginro gonna just forfeit.",2
292,     Senku: Think again muthafucka,2
293,"here's the new OP    I've liked it even more than the first one.    I just love how big of a sister Kohaku is, the scene she embraces Suika is so fucking heartwarming",1
294,Apparently we who prefer the second opening are the minority. I always found myself skipping the first OP. This one is a lot better.,1
295,Yeah the first one sounded a bit too intense for my taste to be honest.,1
296,I see Taiju and Yuzuriha on the OP give them back already!,2
297,It's so weird they've been absent for 10 or so episodes when they've been introduced like main characters :o .,2
298,I'm honestly really worried about them since we haven't seen anything of them even when we've been shown the Tsubasa empire.,1
299,"Naw, I think once Gen 'confirmed' Senku was dead, Tsubasa left them join them and I can imagine with Taiju's work and Yuzuriha's arts and craft, they've probably made themselves into important members. Gotta get close too yano.",0
300,"Yuzuriha is easily one of the most valuable members of a primitive society. She's like Kaiseki, only with handicrafts. Doesn't matter how strong your goon squad is when winter rolls around and nobody has proper clothes",1
301,Well Gen knows about them right? He didn't seem concerned when he showed up here so they're presumably still fine.,1
302,Wait an anime only who likes Taiju and Yuzu?!,1
303,Damn right I do!,0
304,"I honestly really liked the whole Brains, Muscle, Craftsmanship dynamic that they and Senku had. Are the actually unpopular?",1

307,Oh I thought it’d be ok this time since they asked for it. I’m not willingly discussing about it.,1
308,I heard that the reason they were removed from the story was because readers disliked them,0
309,That’s a joke becuase the manga got popular after they were removed from the story. The writer didn’t do it specifically for the viewers.,1
310,Oh fair enough. I just know that there are stories of other manga changing course from what the author planned very quickly after it starts because of reader opinions.,1
311,"Technically you still have:    Brains - Senku    Muscle - Kohaku, though she can't hold a candle to Taiju's Stamina.    Craftsmanship - Kaseki",1

313,"I'm curious, is it possible to do something like that IRL?    Using water like that to start a fire...",1
314,You can 10 billion percent do that    ,2

316,"That's one of the reasons why bottled water is so important when you're camping. If you get lost in the woods and don't have all that boy scout know-how, you can focus the light through the water to light a fire.",0

318,Yeah it is!,1
319,"Yes it is sadly. If someone trow away a bottle with still Liquor inside it, with an unlucky angel and ""High noon"" Forest fires can also break out like that",1
320,I highly doubt he could hold it in the right position and kept it aiming at the same spot tbh,0

328,Those spear sounds reminded me of OPM S2 ngl..,2
329,"Lol true, but I'm not expecting OPM S1 level fights and animation in this show so I don't mind it.",0
330,Well this show has much better direction than OPM 2 anyway.,1
331,"Yeahhhh, but this isn't an action show, so it's fine.",1
332,"Reminded me of the hits that Garou was taking from Bang and he's like ""shit im about to lose consciousness""",0

336,"This was fun. The power of science and charisma came through in the end for Chrome. Now it doesn't matter who wins, since Ruri will be saved.    It's nice to have Gen back at the right time. Hopefully he sticks around a bit longer than last time.",1
337,"Gen is my favourite character alongside Senku honestly everyone in the kingdom of science at the moment is great!, but I wonder if Tsukasa is on Gen’s tail",1
338,"Well I suppose it depends on how Tsukasa approached it. If he completely trusted Gen's assessment, then he shouldn't worry if Gen went to collect more info on the natives so Tsukasa knows what about what he might have to encounter.    But if Tsukasa is suspicious he might have another spy to check on Gen. Tsukasa's pretty smart so I wouldn't be  surprised if he went with that option, but I suppose it depends on the level of trust.",1
339,"Don't forget that while Tsukasa is smart, so is Gen. He's a master at predicting psychology. He wouldn't have gone back if he thought that Tsukasa would do something like that.",1
340,"Hmm, good point.",1
341,"True, though I wish Senku could just defeat Tsukasa so Gen can have more screentime haha",1
342,EGG CRUSHING FINALE!     ,0
343,"All according to keikaku .       &nbsp;     NOTE: ""keikaku"" means ""plan""",2
344,"Ah, yes, the necessary flashback to last episode. We needed that.",1
345,"God I love this anime.    I was so confused why Chrome is shielding the mask like what's he gonna use it for and is defending it with his life?    Then as he hold still I immediately thought IS HE STARTING A FIRE WITH THAT LENS?! A FREAKING CONCAVE LENS!!!    Like what Senku said there is   no way   you can do that. No freakin' way! What shocked me the most, and Senku, is that Chrome filled the lenses with his sweat to create a ""fake"" convex lens so he can start the fire. Chrome is a fucking genius!  though I doubt you can actually do that in real life, but whatever, Chrome is damn cool! ",0
346,"Water lenses that can start fires, are actually a thing!",2
347,"i was expecting chrome to lose after his failed due to his concave lents, then senku pull some sheaningas and win against magma. stealing the spotlight from chrome. almost like it happens in 1000000% of shounens. this was much better.",0
348,"i agree, the fact that the show doesn't feel the need to knock down side characters in order to make the protagonist look even better is one of the things I like. It's like, the show is secure in the fact that we know senku is awesome, it doesn't have to beat us over the head with it.",1
349,"Yeah, Senku is like a catalyst who's constantly bringing out the best in all the other characters.",1
350,IMO the best example of that this episode was Ginro. The herbs barely did anything but his sheer belief in Senku and his science made him a goddamn champion.,1
351,aqua lenses are possible    ,2
352,"Oh wow! So it is possible. Though we have to take into consideration that Chrome used his sweat that is totally not pure water so it can fail IRL + he has to hold it real still while he is almost on the verge of fainting which he did, proud of this boi. Or it may be, who knows, experimenting things is amazing.",1
353,"In this case, what matters more is how transparent the liquid is rather than it being pure.    Considering the amount of sweat used and size of impurities in sweat, I think we can ignore them.",0
354,"The thing that makes me thing is that in this case we have a three-way interface: air, water, and glass. I think it'd be interesting to work out the raytracing of it all and I may try to as soon as I have some time. I'd say it probably  can  be done though of course not in such a ridiculously precarious and approximate manner.",1
355,"While watching this Video thanks for that. i begin to wonder if the old Ancient ""pyramid"" Builders also know of this effect. to bring the Power of their Sun God down to earth with little Help of Water",1
356,They wouldn't have had clear materials to hold the water my dude. Glass lenses came before plastic or vinyl.,0
357,"Well, there is a place called the ""Glass Desert"". So there was a possibility for Glass",1
358,"I like how even the characters say ""can you actually do that"" and he confirms and gives an example well starts to, before Gen interrupts.",1
359,"Slightly less relevant, but still cool:     ",1
360,     You think this anime would hit you with anything other than hard science?,0
361,This is the first ever anime that has got me reading the Manga. I've caught up in the Manga but it's really cool to see the Manga get turned into the Anime. This weeks episode was awesome and can't wait for more!,1
362,"though its easy to tell that the animators are having difficulty capturing boichi's style with motion, seeing how characters often get less detailed when they need to move compared to stills that are based of the manga art.    but that wont stop me from enjoying the anime, since its still nice to see the story with voices and music, even if the art isnt as good",1
363,Me too my dude. I held on for Promised Neverland and Kimetsu no Yaiba. But I gave up on this one. I binged the manga last week. Lol,1
364,Best moment of this episode was the look on Suika’s face while she was trying to watch the match -.-,1
365,more like  ,1
366,"oh shit nice new OP    LMAO the reality, funny facial expressions in this ep    they're geniuses, wish I were as smart as them :,    also HAHA gen's mentalist strategy    I love the kingdom of science",1
367,Great episode !    Chrome did an amazing job    Magma is an asshole. Serves him right    Ginro is so funny. The heck he ate all of the ingredients raw so of course he'll get a stomachache LOL. And the Ginro filter VS reality is the most hilarious part for me     And of course Suika is the most adorable one in this anime ,1
368,I just instantly want episode 15 to see how ruri gets cured,1
369,"""here's the cure""     ""oh thanks dawg""     ""Senku, it hasn't been working""    ""Oh dang, guess it wasn't a bacterial infection.""",1
370,using ur own sweat and tears to start a fire to save ur beloved is the manliest thing I've ever seen,1
371,also be totally calm and still despite the beating received,1
372,I say this pretty much every episode but the usage of music in this anime is just superb,1
373,"The science felt a bit iffy this episode, but the end results were awesome.    Also that ref is a POS for allowing such bullshittery to happen, Magma just straight taking advantage of Kinro talking to the ref, and it’s okay.    Probably my least favorite episode, though I still enjoyed it. Things like the ref and the fact Kohaku is dq’d five ft away from the ring just bother the crap out of me.     Curious as to what Rui wanted to tell Senku, she probably saw him in a dream    The new OP and ED are awesome, lots of good things to look forward to.",1
374,"Honestly going into the tournament arc here I think this is truly about the best way the whole thing could have gone down.    Kinro shows he can win, along with Suika getting to be helpful, but gets beat by Magma being underhanded meaning he isn't the final victor which wouldn't have worked.      Ginro wins to create hope but can't be the final victor so ""loses"" in a moment that adds humor to the whole thing.      Kohaku has already shown she can beat Magma and her winning was actually a loosing scenario for the team so having her get DQ'ed with such a heartwarming moment was better than having her lose or throw the fight against someone else.    Senku winning would have felt forced and cliche so he couldn't be the one to beat Magma.  Not to mention he probably shouldn't be the final victor to marry the girl.    So Chrome winning in a way that shows he's smart beyond just what Senku tells him while still not feeling cheep through the help of Gen was probably the best scenario for his fight.",1
375,I honestly though they were gonna focus on the galaxy brain aspect of Senku with him having an ace in the hole in case it came down to him in the finals.,1
376,"Honestly that was about my worst case scenario because we didn't even see him preparing anything or something that would suggest he had been worried about it, if he pulled something out last minute like that it would have cheapened the whole struggle.    From the moment we found out the winner gets to marry Chrome's waifu I wondered how they were gonna make him win.  When he went to get the sulfur instead of having him train I thought they might actually let Chrome pull a ""as long as I save her life I don't care who wins"" but then when he was shown to be training in the last episode I figured they would have him actually win.  But I was pleasantly surprised about how he won and thought the whole tournament went way better than I would have guessed at the start.",1
377,I absolutely loved the episode because of all of this.,1
378,"Thanks, i like this breakdown",1
379,"No problem, I was really apprehensive about the tournament when they first mentioned it but I've been really satisfied overall how it was handled overall.",1
380,"Chrome winning felt cliché to me. As soon as I saw Kinro losing, I knew Chrome would be the winner somehow, to feed the whole romance plot. Don't get me wrong, I liked that he won, I'm all for his romance as I'm rooting for him. But ""Win tournament to marry the girl I love"" felt more cliché than if Senku would have won because he's an MC.    I was hoping something like, Senku won, rejected the marriage, and instead, asked for something else that changed the village in a way. The ChromeRuri romance plot would be left open to be developed better.    But the tournament arc showcased everything as you said, so I'm satisfied.",1
381,"I think Chrome winning is the right kind of cliche, fighting to get the girl is cliche because it's what people like to see.  And even then I think they did it in the least cliche way you could do something like this.  He wasn't fighting to marry her, that's just a bonus, he wants to save her life.  He didn't train to beat him for days leading up to it, he trained to lose but cause damage so someone else could win.    Senku winning would have felt like he won just because he's the main character.  We never saw him training and he's specifically shown to be weaker than everyone else.  He's supposed to be brainy not brawny.  Sure he could have won with since science trick but again his winning and getting the girl would have been the wrong kind of cliche.    But overall yeah I think this episode really moved Dr Stone up in my eyes.",1
382,That’s what i was hoping for as well,1
383,"Definitely fell in the category of ""Would never fucking work out like that in real life.""    For the least of which reason that Magma is a sweaty teenager doing exercise outdoors. I doooont think his clothes would be dry enough to set aflame.",1
384,He did say it was fur. The base of it would have gotten wet with sweat. Not the surface.,2
385,"Wait, is Magma supposed to be a teenager?",2
386,"     The anime doesn't exactly make it clear but Senku does mention that its a surface flash fire. His clothes could be soaked with sweat and this would still work because it only ignites the outer fibers that stick off the clothes, which are abundant on cotton clothes.    I actually can't find any videos of the effect but basically in order for the fibers sticking off the clothes to be damp enough to not catch fire on a bright and sunny day like this his clothes would have to be absolutely drenched. Like dunked in water, over saturated drenched.",1
387,"I don't recall any tribe I have ever heard about using a fight to determine leader. Tribes go for a elder system of some sort normally. In some cases a war leader will rule but that is sort of a by acclamation vote based on their leadership in battle and other places over a period of time, thus normally older than younger.     So the selection contrived.",0
388,"     They can produce sodium hydroxide and electricity. Its not hard to put fruit in a jar and forget about it for a week. They could easily produce a still too given what else they've done.    Also I'm guessing the ""hundred stories"" Ruri knows have something to do with the past, and one of them probably has Senku's name. I'm going to bet that the founder of the village knew Senku somehow and the village is made of their decendents after unthawing.",1
389,"I think the ref was walking a fine line here. He doesn't want Magma to win, but if the obviously strongest competitor gets disqualified instead of defeated it will weaken the legitimacy of the tournament as a test of fitness. So instead of calling out Magma, the ref lets his opponents get away with as much as is reasonably possible.     Kohaku was given no leeway at all because if she wins they'll need to do a  third  tournament and ain't nobody got time for that.",2
390,"Wow.    Anyone else that absolutely hated the referee this EP ????     Magma hits Kinro with a cheap shot while they are discussing the rules    -   ""YUP! NOTHING WRONG HERE! GG MAGMA!""         Kohaku is a few seconds late    -   ""GG KOHAKU DISQUALIFIED AND I WON'T EVEN GIVE HER A MINUTE""       Magma's clothes spontaneously catch on fire for no reason to them after Gen the ""Sorcerer"" just allegedly casted a spell on Magma    -   ""GG CHROME WINS! GOOD CLEAN FIGHT!""        That stuff really pissed me off for some reason.",0
391,"It's probably justified though, the village has probably never seen so many different attempts at gaming the system. This is supposed to be a simple tournament where 2 guys fight and the winner moves on. Nobody was expecting to have to deal with magic masks, backstabbing, doping, fake emergencies, random sorcerers coming back from the dead to curse contestants, extended mid-match games of Red Light, or contestants spontaneously combusting.",0
392,Senku is already introducing the village to the greatest invention of humanity: Reckless cheating. I'm so proud of him.,1
393,"He's obviously biased, but every match he's biased in a different way:      Let Magma win by cheap-shotting; Maybe he felt like if he was going to allow the mask, he'd need to allow such tricks to be consistent?    Disqualify Kohaku; He likely has his own reasons not wanting Kohaku to winfight Magma, assuming he was instructed by the Chief.    Chrome casts fireball and nut-shots; There's a weird guy making likely empty threats on top of the chief's hut and the local weirdo just conjured fired from nothing and threw the village's strongest guy off the cliff by his nuts, using the same mask you ruled was legal a few matches ago. Would you risk pissing off these two like Level 10 Wizards by calling foul, only for your rulings to be contested based on some genuinely sound arguments?",0
394,"        I don't think so. It seemed to be more about the fact that there were no allowances when it came to the rules. Even if she was late by just a few seconds, she was still late and I guess he ruled that there would be no exception.",0
395,"     You can literally see him unhappy about doing it when he sideglances at Kohaku coming in late, what are you on about?",0
396,The ref being blind makes the show more authentic.,0
397,Gen sorcery was to stop Magma's heart.    Everyone on the village already labeled Chrome as a sorcerer so they pretty much think that the fire was from his sorcery instead.,2
398,"Well it depends on the rules they have for the tournament. Unless it was directly against the rules, there's no reason why he would have to penalise Magma for attacking Kinro while he was talking to the ref. You could say it was his own fault he lowered his guard like that and had his back turned. Likewise with the other occurrences that he let slide. It would make more sense to take issue with the tournament rules than with the ref.",0
399,Can someone actually calculate how to start a fire like that?,2
400,"There are stories of geniuses solving very complicated math problems in their head.    For example, there's a certain math problem called ""two trains and a fly"" that goes like this:         This is a trick question because there a two ways to solve this problem: the very difficult ""right"" way by using calculus to determine the sum of a converging infinite series, or the easy ""trick"" way using basic deduction the trains will crash in 1 hour and the fly travels at a constant speed of 75 kmhour, so the fly will travel 75 kilometers.    According to the story, Jon Von Neumann a very famous mathematician who was a child prodigy was told this problem as a student, and instantly gave the right answer.  The person who told him the problem was disappointed and said something like ""You must have heard this before and known the trick.""  Von Neumann is said to have been responded ""What trick? I summed the infinite series.""",0
401,Did Von Neumann also feel a little dumb when he learned the trick?,0
402,There are savants who can solve equations in their head. It just means Senku is smarter than Einstein.,1
403,Smarter? Maybe not. Better at keeping his braining running with math? The story has the kid keeping himself at least semi-conscious for  ,1
404,"Intelligence is a measure of potential, not of results. Had everyone not turned into stone Senku wouldve won a Nobel prize with a shocking new discovery of some sort or another.",1
405,And yet nobody with a sane brain would base that on the fact that he has a good memory and is very good at calculating stuff in his head. Even he said earlier in the story that he is nothing special when it comes to those groundbreaking inventions.,1
406,"He’s a savant. Savants are free from the shackles of mathematics and are free to think about complex topics abstractly. The way Senku’s Brian functions places his potential around the level of Einstein. And with modern technology being what it currently is, Senku has all the tools to surpass Einstein.     Well, except for the collapse of civilization part.",1
407,     I don't think you even believe for a second what you're writing so I'm just going to ignore this bad taste troll. You have a lot of time on your hands to try and say such things about a random anime on a forum on the internet.,0
408,"What are you even talking about. Your lack of understanding doesn’t mean what I’m saying lacks truth. Einstein is famous because he realized that space and time form an interconnected plane. Senku is capable of that sort of abstract thinking and he can instantly test hypothesis to boot.     Plus he’s a fictional character meant to represent the pinnacle of scientific knowledge, just saying    Edit: also can’t wait until Asagiri gets his cola, Senku recovers the bat poop cave, and the space age is reached in a matter of years. Because I actually watch the anime dumbass    Edit edit: Sulfy-Chan is my waifu",0
409,"In a post truth world, one's ignorance is equal to your supposed ""science"".",0
410,"     Lmao, I guess you never got very far in math. This really shows the how lacking public education is when people think that math is all just following hard rules and formulas.    Actual high level mathematics  requires  abstract thinking.    Math is the language that makes true sense of the world.",1
411,"I’ve taken plenty of math; do you know how much legwork goes into even the simplest mathematical discovery? I’ve had to write entire proofs on concepts that one takes for granted in public schooling. You don’t just stumble upon E = MC2, you have to spend pages pages of mathematical gymnastics deriving it from already known laws. If Senku can do complex equations in his head, he can also trace the entire proof without having to fret over calculations.     It’s not that Senku is capable of multiplying big numbers, lots of people can do that. Senku can literally apply mathematics at will.    Stop trying to act like you’re smart by contradicting me, you sound stupider with each response.",1
412,"     Read usernames my dude.         First you say he's ""free from the shackles of mathematics"" but now you're saying his advantage is that he ""applies mathematics at will"", make up your mind mate",1
413,Basicaly Senku this episode ,2
414,I laughed so fucking hard at ginro's self delusion scene,1
415,"Ginro is consistently funny as hell. He has so much potential to just be awful, like Mantle, but he pulls it off.",0
416,"Sure he's an absolute idiot, a bit of a scumbag, lazy, petty, a coward... what was I saying again?",0
417," THINK OF YOUR WAIFU AND BE CALM!       utahapraises      Why do i feel like the judge is gonna call foul for the melon?  Something is fishy...      OH NO HE DIDNT JUST BREAK THE MELON OF JUSTICE!  FUCK THAT GUY!      Oh man new OP looks like a lot of fun is waiting for us.      Of course the asshole wins too.      And Monkey vs Potato, this should be funny.      Fuck those assholes and thier scheming.  YOU DONT MAKE MELON LORD AND JANE CRY!      Ginro... what do you got for us?  Oh god... hes doomed... F for Squirrel boy.      Ginro is high as a kite and just going berserk ahhahahaha.  But he won!  Hahhahahaha      So Senku advances to the finals and Monkey is fighting the Asshole.  Lets see how this plays out.      GANBATE MONKEY!  DESTROY HIS TESTICLES!      OH DAMN SHARKFACE IS BACK! AW YEAH!      Damn hes taking a beating, but whats he got up his sleeve?      Start a fire with the lense?  Well.... we can see if it works.      Wait hes not?  Whats he doing?  Oh he is thanks to water?      MATHS!  MORE MATHS!  EVEN MORE MATHS!  60 SECS!      Sharkface taunt?  Oh damn.  Thats some mind games and thanks to his fake death its working.      SUCH A SMUG SENKU FACE I LOVE IT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!      THINK OF YOUR WAIFU AND BE CALM!  I love it!      FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!  MAGMA IS FEELING A LITTLE HOT.      HE USED HIS SPECIAL MOVE! TESTICLES DESTROYED!      Science won this fight!  Fuck you assholes!  Time to save us a sister!",1
418,KEEP    CALM    AND    THINK OF    YOUR WAIFU,1
419,Exactly what i was thinking of haha.,1
420,They're moving through this tournament very quickly. Like fire.,2
421,"Not gonna lie, I'm glad they're blowing through this tournament. I couldn't care less about Magma or Tsukasa or Taiju or Yuzuhira. I just want to watch Senku do all the science things to bring back the modern age.",1
422,I'm just glad they ditched the ridiculously overpoweredintelligent Tsukasa for a meathead with limits who actually acts like you'd expect.  Far more believable and fun to watch.,1
423,"The new ED is so touching. If they cover more family background story of Senku or Taiju's I'll be more than happy.    The episode itself is honestly slightly disappointed than I expected for the resolution of the hyped tournament. I can't believe Magma wasn't disqualified by backstabbing Kinro and then the judge just shrugged off and ignored it. Also igniting the cloth by the glass lens is a bit too unrealistic for me even the Dr. Stone's standard.    It seems like the actual winner of the tournament is not declared yet.  ""my guess is Chrom would concede to Senku to give the marriage to him? Otherwise Senku doesn't have to be in the tourney to begin with.""    Hype for Taiju and Yuzuriha in OP! Looking forward to the second cour.",1
424,Well technically as long as Jasper didn't declare a victor the fight is still on going.  The only mistake was he turned his back to Magma when asking question.,0
425,"Well, Magma told him that he'd forfeit once he confirmed with the judge that it was legal.  Kinro's mistake was believing him.  The judge can't do much since Kinro was done asking the question, and the fight is still ongoing.  Otherwise, the contestants can keep delaying the fight by repeatedly turning around to ask questions.    As for your meta prediction, Senku is in the tournament because he can still give an easy win to his friends or try to wear down the opponent, for example by running around the ring.  Don't forget that Senku still has to fight Ginro, and Ginro might try to win it all.  The way they drummed up the previous relationship, most everyone will probably be rooting for Chrome though.",1
426,"If Jaspter clearly explains it like that I would agree and fine with it. For me it is the lack of compelling explanation in the scene's direction, not the plot itself.",1
427,There is no reason that Magma would be disqualified in that scene.,0
428,Magma take advantage of his honesty and hit him from behind.  That why he immedically attack right after Jasper say the mask is ok,1
429,     Some people in another comment already pointed out this is completely feasible.,2
430,"The water lens is actually feasible. Slightly exaggerated in anime fashion for this specific occurrence, but the concept is scientifically sound nonetheless.",2
431,"More than slightly exaggerated, it was a suspension-of-disbelief breaking. The sun had to be in just the right spot, the melon had to be broken just right so he could hold it with the spear without blocking the light, he had to collect enough sweat to fill the lens while being beaten, Magma had to hold perfectly still even though he had no reason to even with Gen saying his heart would explode if he took a step he had no reason to freeze completely enough that the light would be on the same spot for a full minute,  Chrome  had to hold the spear  so perfectly still  that the liquid in the lens didn't even  ripple , and Magma had to not notice the bright spot of light on his clothes that was steadily heating up to 300 fucking degrees.    It's ridiculous for an improvised plan with that many points of failure to go without a hitch on the first try, and it's even  more  ridiculous for a scientist who knows  exactly  how much trial and error it takes to get this shit to work to rely on an untested and barely plausible method he just came up with in the heat of battle.    It was a shitty way to resolve his arc. It flew in the face of all the hard work and preparation and trial and error they've been doing this whole time, because apparently they can just wait until a crisis to whip up some half-baked idea using whatever's around, and the Plot Gods will magically align everything so it works regardless of how dumb it is.",0
432,"I mean, what  else  could he have done? Personally it seems well within anime limits of disbelief-suspension to me. As long as it's theoretically possible - regardless of implausibility - I'm more or less fine with it.",1
433,"I just wanted to see something that was prepared in advance. A flashbang, a sling, anything you would logically think to bring to a fight with a superior opponent. The power of science doesn't let you pull solutions to any problem out of your ass in a minute, it lets you think up and test a bunch of solutions so you're sure you have one that works. This is literally the message I got from this show until now.",1
434,"Science also gives you a wider set of options with which to improvise. Improvisation isn't the same as ass-pulling, even though people always seem to conflate the two.    Chrome recognized an opportunity to apply a scientific principle. That's engineering in a nutshell",1
435,Engineering in a nutshell is  repeatedly failing  to apply a scientific principle until you find a simpler way that actually works. A decent engineer isn't going to stake everything on a solution with a million points of failure.,0
436,Except a Enginer will try anything that can work no matter how improbable when nothing else possible is left for them to try and they consider failure costly.     Thus the dramatic license.,0
437,Completely agree about the ED. It actually made me a little sad. All this time and it just occurred to me they had families that they must miss so much,0
438,"You said it better than I did in my own comment, but I absolutely agree. Gen coming back is a bit to convenient as well.     This was the only way of throwing some science in, but it was cool to see what Senku can do in his head",1
439,"Senku implies that Gen has been watching them for quite some time, so it's not that strange for him to show himself at a crucial moment in order to get what he wants.",1
440,"He implied he was watching that specific day, i think",2
441,"Maybe Chrome and Senku will keep trying to concede to the other, since either or gives some big advantages.    Or maybe they'll be dual-leaders: Chrome as Ruri's husbando and Senku as village's acting leader.",1
442,"I doubt they're gonna try any shenanigans, I'm pretty sure they'll just concede and let Chrome through. Senku has no interest in leading, and it would be pretty dumb if Kinro won it all in the end. Chrome, on the other hand, is a pretty substantial ship with Ruri, and in a lot of ways, this is his chapter of the story. There's no reason for them to push Senku up even more; this is Chrome's time to shine.",1
443,"If chrome wins, he would likely have authority to invite senku into the village",1
444,"Yeah, I have a feeling Senku will be the winner as well, although I don't really have a good reason for thinking that x",1
445,Probably so Senku can do whatever he wants. if chrome was the village head they would follow him not senku if that makes sense. And also I don't think Chrome wants to marry Ruri like that.,1
446,I mean Senku can still do whatever he wants with Chrome in charge.,2
447,"Fuck Magma. What a piece of shit, geez. At least Gen has his relatable passion for cola going for him. Magma has no redeeming qualities.    He's not even the strongest guy in the village!",0
448,"I think deep down Gen at least has a kind heart, he's just the kind of person who needs a ""selfish reason"" to do things for others to maintain his facade.",1
449,You completely missed the point of Gen’s character.,0
450,"Does anyone know the OST track for Kinro's Masked Warrior? It really reminds me of classic cartoons, it's great. The crescendo is awesome.",1
451,Im a hundred billion percent sure that Senku is going to try and pull something so that he  marries Ruri and becomes leader.     Something something    i become chief    something something    for the kingdom of science    something something    i get to dictate what the people do    something something    evil face senku  ,0
452,Chrome would be better as a Puppet King that Senku could control through   his teachings   their unwavering trust and friendship. He's somewhat of a outcast but he's still part of the tribe and likely carries more sway with them than a sorcerer from the outside.,1
453,"Yh, Chrome will most likely become chief. Just thought there'd be a quick joke skit where Senku teases Chrome",2
454,"Everyone seems to have missed how Kohaku clearly shouted ""Suika!"" while the subs wrote ""Senku""",1
455,Magmas bloodline: terminated,2
456,So how does Magma know what a minute is? Or was he just confirming the sorceror had a set amount of time before he ran out of power?,2
457,I mean these people are descendants of modern humans in one way or another and i think basic time keeping would be one of the things that survives generations of losing knowledge.,0
458,"Did they tell Magma ""a minute?"" That was a time Gen knew, but I think he just implied to Magma that he would ""hold out as long as he could."" Given the performance, Magma assumed that would be ""reasonably soon,"" so he had no reason to chance it.",0
459,Ginro Chuuni yeeting his opponent out of the ring was too much. Then he goes all skinny all-might afterwards.,2
460,"Oh great, the smug snake is back.     finethen",1
461,"I gotta say, when Magma got lit on fire, that was one of the most satisfying things I've ever seen!",1
462,Not him getting his nuts jabbed and knocked off a cliff?,0
463,"Well yes, that too! I mean just in general, him getting defeated felt so satisfying!",1
464,"     YEAH!         YEAH! ...wait a minute         WAIT NO STOP         AH FUCK WE LOST    EVEN SENKU SEES IT COMING    tbh I expected it, there was totally gonna be something that leads to Chrome winning and getting his waifu, but it doesn't make it any less harder to watch the car heading straight for the wall",0
465,"This episode was so memeable.    ""I'm something of a science user myself""    Senku's calculations    I hope to see some new formats on ranimemes",1
466,"New OP! Gonna miss singing ""Ohayou sekai, good morning wooooorld!""",1
467,why did they switch it to a like dislike poll?,2
468,Ginro's match was the funniest shit LMFAO.,1
469,"I'm going to miss the ED, I honestly think it was way better than the OP",1
470,They cheesed the hell out of this tournament. Who needs honor or talent when you can use knowledge to manipulate the fight?,0
471,"In the new opening I noticed a cross, I think it’ll be incredible how they tackle religion",2
472,What do you mean?,2
473,"I think it's Senku's fake grave that Taiju and Yuzuriha made, since they are the ones beside the cross.",0
474,"While I preferred Good Morning World over this new OP, I will say that I basically died laughing when   PELICAN FANCLUB   showed up on the screen",1
475,It's certainly one of the more unique band names out there. Sometimes you just gotta bird up.,1
476,"well this is slightly petty that i am still upset about it, but last week i got accused of lying about anime only to get away with posting spoilers,,  got a bunch of downvotes, then my post got deleted for posting untagged speculation.    here's what i was right about so far:    1 chrome becoming leader and ""somehow"" beating magma in a way i couldn't predict- and i definitely didn't predict the fire and gen showing up    2 ginro winning his match      here's what i was wrong about:    1 thinking kohaku would make it to the final round and throw for chrome, when she actually didn't win any rounds    2 thinking kinro would lose because of the mask disqualifying him, but he actually just got backstabbed by magma.    yet to be confirmed:    1  ""the village splitting into a pro-science, senku aligned faction and an anti-science, tsukasa faction"", which is must be said i have been predicting since we found out tsukasa was the girls' ideal man     2  ""ruri knows senku because senku's dad founded the village and passed down knowledge about senku to the lorekeeper like the momonga animal story was passed down""    if people still think i am lying i don't really know what to say. i probably won't keep posting on this sub or at least on the seasonal anime since i mainly like making predictions and looking for plot hooks, so having to spoiler tag most of what i post would be awkward and being accused of being a liar takes some of the fun out of sharing my speculation in the first place.",0
477,I just read the comment. Any manga reader could've said you were far off to a mod. Shame.,0
478,"I think you're fine. Good speculations which may or may not turn out how you thought. It is surprising some things are pretty dead on. The mods are quite hit or miss in this sub in how they enforce things, you might be better off on the Dr. Stone subreddit, but it can be littered with spoilers from manga readers.",1
479,"     ironically, the spoiler policy on this subreddit is a major reason i've participated here. even when spoilers on other subreddits are tagged or otherwise marked as spoilers, for some reason i often reflexively read them before i mentally process that they're an actual spoiler, which is a major reason i don't participate on those subreddits, and that's ignoring that untagged spoilers tend to be more common too. since here they're contained to the ""source corner,"" which i would have to go out of my way to read since it's not mixed with the other discussion, i don't have this problem.     i know a lot of people seem to dislike the spoiler restriction, but overall this is a very anime only friendly subreddit when there can be something of a stigma against being anime only in other circles. it's just limiting the visibility of anime only speculation like other subreddits would a spoiler that's weird to me, but then i wouldn't want to be the one to do the thankless job the mods have either moderating threads or setting policy.",1
480,Spoilers can ruin a show for me so I'm glad this subreddit is so strict about them.,0
481,I wish this subreddit was strict about them. People were constantly spoiling shit in the YU-NO and Attack on Titan threads.,0
482,Eh I feel like they do a pretty good job. I'm not sure of the last time I got a major spoiler on here.,1
483,"There was a masked character in the last few episodes of YU-NO and in one of the threads, we were speculating on their identity and someone just posted a picture from the VN of the character with their mask off.    I reported it, but it was still a massive spoiler for me and had been up for hours.",2
484,Wow that really sucks. I feel for you bro.,1
485,"     I remember when one of my comments was removed for complaining about the way a character was treated in Naruto Shippuden , at a time when in every thread everyone would be outright spoiling episodes' worth of plot about shows much bigger on this sub. Good fucking times. Not like the end of Shippuden is worth anything to begin with too. Preventing spoilers from being posted is good, but jesus fuck hypocritical mods that just let the ""hype"" happen always pissed me off.",0
486,Some of the things you say are kinda obvious anyway. That's probably why the mods think it's a spoiler or something.     ;    Personally I like seeing speculation so please do continue.,1
487,"On your 2, I had the same exact thinking too. We'll see how the anime does it otherwise there's no good explanation I can think of of how Ruri knows Senku's name.",1
488,"It's worth spoiler tagging predictions, just in case people don't want even speculation to mess with their own enjoyment. Just comment on what  has  happened and spoiler tag what  hasn't  and you should be fine.",1
489,"Time doesn’t exist in this anime, just like JoJo’s. The characters can talk for 20 minutes straight and the villain won’t do anything meanwhile. Before he was fooled by Gen’s ‘sorcery’, Magma had so many chances to finish Chrome off...",0
490,It's even worse in Dragonball because they are all supposedly moving around at light speed while everyone is monologueing.,0
491,And planets that are about to explode in a few minutes lasts for a lot of episodes.,2
492,I mean Gen kinda handwaved it away at least by mentioning that Magma was super exhausted and was taking every opportunity to rest. As long as Chrome wasn't coming after him he was happy to have a break.,1
493,One second has passed     dio it's been a fucking hour and you call that a second ,2
494,"What a great show, how many chapters will air?",1
495,24,2
496,"Amazing, thanks",1
497,I'm a bit of a science user myself!,2
498,MY GOOD MORNING WORLD THEY STOLE IT     YOU THIEVES BRING IT BACK          Crunchyroll Stop it,0
499,"Now the question is, where do the villagers shit?",0
500,Over the edge of the island?,2
501,"Hope they don't drink from there too, or else Senku's first order of business after gaining the village's trust will have to be convincing them that a big stinking portion of their health issues could be easily avoided by not drinking shit water.",1
502,Isn’t that sea water?,2
503,Is it? I never noticed whether those islands were off the coast or in the middle of a lake.,2
504,"I assumed it was a bay at the very least, but what do I know. If it is a lake though, the Latrine would have to be pretty far inland to stop sewage runoff",1
505,"The water may or may not be drinkable, but so long as they shit off the side downstream from the side they draw water from, they would probably be fine. Just to be safe they would probably want to draw water from a little bit outside town which would be more convenient than going out of town to crap.",0
506,Rip OHIO SEKKAI,2
507,I miss the old ED already...,0
508,"Same. The new one isn't bad, but ＜LIFE＞ was smooth af.",1
509,I wonder what Senku’s backup plan would’ve been if Chrome lost. I saw this title and definitely thought he was going to make a flamethrower or something,1
510,"My bet would've been gunpowder at the tip of his ""spear"". Convince Magma that he's a super strong sorcerer and get 1 hit in to blow up his chest.",1
511,He also could’ve totally just thrown acid at him if it came down to it,2
512,Sulfuric Acid-chan is helping!,1
513,Or that one acid capable of human disposal,1
514,"The amount of dirty tactics in the tournament was amazing, rigged from the ground up haha",1
515,Can’t wait to see how the cola is made!,2
516,"Aw, aw AWWWWW! He's looking into the back of a reflecting telescope in the end credits? Aw. For a science Anime that hurts my soul.",0
517,1.5 episode tournament arc? Not bad.     The new OP’s visuals are really pleasing as well but nothing will beat good morning world.,1
518,The new ED and flashbacks makes me want a prequel series with the cast as kids performing science experiments.,1
519,I don't like the new OP as much but it has so many hype shots of things to come,0
520,"""Don't worry, I'm something of a scientist user myself""       HMMM   ",1
521,FUCKING AMAZING EPISODE,1
522,"What Magma did was obviously cheating. Like, it wasn't even hidden. Kinda bad writing that he won despite it to be honest.",1
523,     What do you mean exactly?,2
524,Kinro was clearly consulting the referee. The match doesn't go on when something like that is happening. And Magma himself had said that if the referee ruled that the helmet being given to Kinro hadn't broken the rules that would mean he had lost.    You can't say that you forfeit and then sucker punch your opponent.,1
525,"He didn't cheat, he was just being a jerk. Nobody called time out, and his ""semi-surrender"" was only heard between the two of them. It was dirty pool, but within the rules they had going which are pretty lax.",1
526,"Actually I want to say more about that. Where are you getting that nobody heard his surrender? They're, what, 5 metres away from him? Did Magma whisper it tenderly into Kinro's ears? And does Senku have super-human hearing because he clearly reacts to it!",1
527,"They specifically note that Suika can't hear what they are saying, I believe to imply that nobody else could either. I don't think Senku could hear either, he could just tell from body language that  something  was up.",2
528,"He was on his knees while Kinro turned his back to him. How dumb would the villagers have to be to think he was doing anything else even if they somehow hadn't heard him as you said? Also, the good guy squad clearly heard him.    I'm saying he should have been called out.  Especially  if the rules are lax because otherwise he could have been exploiting a loophole.",0
529,"They specifically note that Suika can't hear what they are saying, I believe to imply that nobody else could either. I don't think Senku could hear either, he could just tell from body language that something was up.     Him being on his knees would be no more a ""surrender"" than when Chrome was on his belly several times in the fight.",0
530,"That is so much bullshit. If that's what the creators were intending I want to have a discussion with them about sound, from about 6 metres away because apparently they think I should be inauidible.    Besides, the referee clearly must have heard it. And I don't understand how people can say that it's within the rules to attack someone who's consulting the referee. Even if every villager is deaf they would have seen that. Have you people seen a single sport?",0
531,"     They weren't shouting, Magma was speaking fairly softly, they were outside, with a little crowd noise and wind going on, I have no trouble buying that they couldn't hear from that distance.          Have  they? ",0
532,"No, that's why their rules are loose. The ref decided on the spot that the helmet wasn't breaking the rules. Even uncultured tribesmen would be able to tell that letting someone who feigned forfeit win is bullshit.",0
533,"Again, it is unclear to anyone others than Kinro that Magma forfeited. He was downed, like Chrome was, but the fight was not ""to downed,"" and he did not  publicly  forfeit the match. It was dirty, but not rule violating, like a football player who hits a  little  too hard but not hard enough to call a penalty especially back in the old days, where refs didn't care.",0
534,     There is no rule that states that. The match ends when the opponent is knocked out or surrenders.,0
535,"Imagine if people kept trying to score in goals when a referee stopped the match in football the good kind where they use their feet These rules are kind of expected.     And even if they weren't, there should have been some kind of disapproval of it. We humans tend to dislike cheap bullshit, especially when it's determining our next fucking village chief.",1
536,"Bro you are comparing football to a stone-age chief selection tournament.    Cheap bullshit or not, being cunning is an important aspect for a future chief.",0
537,While cheating is not so good for someone who's going to be their leader,0
538,Can't think of any primitive tribe that did a battle of young people to choose new chief. So that's a big stretch there to start with. A great war leader sometime but that's a war leader doing well leading in war and normally older to pull that off.,0
539,True.,1
540,They made that way more complicated than it needed to be.,2
541,Better than Chrome stabbing Magma in the dick and winning like that.,1
542,That new OP is great!,1
543, NEW OP HYPE!,2
544,Magma got Endgame'd so hard,0
545,That’s some bull shit reffing haha but I guess we couldn’t have the bad guy defeated instantly.,0
546,Can we discuss evan stone here too?,2
547,Another win for the Kingdom of science. Got to give it to Chrome for winning the match against Magma with a little help from Senkuu and Gen. Seeing what Ginrou thought he looked liked compared to what he actually looked like was pretty funny.,1
548,"Eh, this episode wasn't nearly as good. At least Gen is back, we got a new OPED combo and the story can progress.",1
549,Am I the only one who heard STAND sfx in this episode?,2
550,Love the new opening,1
551,"New op looks generic af, don't really mind since i skipped the last one anyway but they really did me dirty by changing the ending, that shit was fire, new one is just shit lol",0
552,Lol Senku is totally going to steal this contest away from Chrome,0
553,How did nobody there expect Magma to pull what he did?    Not a fan of the new OP - visuals are great but the song isn't catchy at all.    I'm surprised Gen is agile enough to climb up to high places and balance on them.,1
554,The OP was a absolute banger.,2
555,damn that went by fast as fuck. its unfortunate for the band who did this OP that they had to follow up OHAYO SEKAI GOOD MORNING WOOOO!!!!!,0
556,Magma's faces were the besttt,2
557,"The new OP previews two new characters: the cotton candy lady and Tsukasa’s new deputy, unless the grape-stomping girls are new too.",2
558,"I mean, it's no       OHAYO SEKAI GOOD MORNING WOOOOOORLD!!!    but it's pretty okay I guess. Also I was basically shouting at Chrome to kick him in the nuts the whole time, I like lighting him on fire better",1
559,"Magma, you bastard! Well I guess it would have been too simple if he just lost to Kinro. The whole process of Chrome beating him was hilarious af.",0
560,"Spoilerific opening, uh?",2
561,"I don't see any spoilers to be honest, just teasers of characters. Doesn't ruin any plot at all. From a manga reader, sure its spoilers because we know what's going to happen but the opening doesn't hint any kind of plot besides ooo new characters.",1
562,"Well, this is a science show, and it clues in some of the science to come. ;",1
563,I half expect Ginro to try and screw everyone over.,0
564,"Senku explaining how Chrome made a convex lens out of his sweat and tears really confused me there. I don't know if it was a subtitle error or what, but the subtitle said that he made a concave out of the convex lens, when in fact it was the other way around.",0
565,"I really want them to kill off Mantle already, that 2ft high dick rider is the most annoying character from any anime I've watched so far. Even more annoying than that frog woman Phryne from Danmachi season 2.",0
566,Ahyeeee,2
567,I really need to know the outro song for EP 14,2
568,Magma is flat between the legs after that ep aha but fr I need to know the name of the song for the outro on the latest ep,2
569,that was a hype fight! was surprised gen came back to help. seems like we're gonna learn more about senku's dad based on the ending.,1
570,I laughed my nuts off when Gen unleashes the DAB on Magma.,1
571,I have a feeling Senku will win the tournament by default because Ginro passed out and Chrome will probably pass out after all that beating. That'd be cliche.,1
572,This is a terrible system of government.,0
573,"Fuck, the last 5 minutes had me breathless",0
574,Gen used shadow possession jutsu. Super effective.,1
575,pretty ok ep. good payoff for all the buildup and the characters were utilized in a way that makes sense for them. senku strangely didn't contribute much during the tournament but that might have been on purpose to show that the other characters are starting to learn stuff.    the childhood friend angle with chrome felt a bit forced as well as the absolutely bonkers rules of the tournament.    also i think they will need some bodyguards after this so magma doesn't assassinate them as he seemingly likes to do.    wonder who will get the big tiddy onee-san next ep.,1
576,the new opening is great. way better than the old one. the new ending though has nothing on the original,1
577,WTF was up with Ruri's face? lol. Great episode otherwise,1
578,I am so fucking happy that the OP doesn’t suck now. Idk what they were thinking with that first one. Just utter dog shit,0
579,"Men this anime its better than it has any right to be.    Easily the anime of this decade from episode 1.    Gen acting and ""sorcery"" lmao.",1
580,     Let's not get ahead of ourselves.,2
581,If we stop praising animation i don't see which anime could surpass this one.    Vinland Saga rn is above average on every aspect but not perfect at anyone.    The only other contenders for this would be Mob S1 and SnK S3 p2. I would like to say that SnK calms down too much after ep 4-5.,1
582,"You're saying that this anime is better than:    1. Shangri-la  2. Katanagatari  3. Summer Wars  4. Yondemasu yo, Azazel-san  5. Tatami Galaxy  6. Durarara!!  7. Hunter x Hunter  8.

583,".........    .........    .........    ... Outbreak Company?    I mean, I liked the show and all, but it definitely doesn't deserve to be on this list.",1
584,"Lets see.    Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.    7: Something something the second strongest character ever doing nothing on the whole story...    15,24,27: If you have absolutely no taste you could consider this as good animes.    32: Good animation == good story    31: Are you honestly trolling? Are you truly thinking Keijo is a contender for anime of the decade?    30: Obviously trolling.    29: Re Zero is really good and i rewatched it several times, the problem is that this first season the plot barely advanced at all which its one of the points of the story since he is resetting the story.    41,42: I honestly don't see how in the world would you put Cells at Work and Pretentious Asshole Ghosts anime above Dr. Stone.    43: Dororo falls insanely hard after the first 12 episodes and its ending is meh.    44: Having good animation doesnt equal having a good story.    Those are honestly the only stuff worth mentioning.",1
585,"     Keijo!!!!!!!! is a masterpiece, so I don't see why not.                        Bruh, are you some sort of hipster weeb whose pet phrase is ""I'm not like the other weebs who think good anime is anime with good animation""? Bad animation doesn't equal having a good story either!           ...   konosubawot3",1
586,     Thanks for not wasting my time bro. It was a pleasure.,1
587,"smh, maybe one day you'll be able to appreciate the plot.",1
588,"Only those?! It's like Shouwa Genroku Rakugou Shinju doesn't exist, Lupin III didn't have 3 tv great series. Or things like Madoka, Psycho pass, Monogatari, Ikuhara stuff don't offer more than Dr.Stone.",1
589,Really? Madoka at the same level of Psycho Pass?    Madoka was bad even for the time it aired. Monogatari is just blegh.     It's hard to get into.    The fuck is Lupin even? Some french cartoon?     Ikuhara tries lets leave it at that.    Can't talk about Shouwa its on my ptw list sadly.,0
590,"I even prefer Madoka+Rebellion over Psycho Pass, but it's more of a personal priorities.  You gave 10 mostly to shonen, so Lupin III.     And now I'm genuinely interested what makes you love Dr.Stone so much? I can agree that it's fun but fail to see how its story can be called great.",1
591,"I honestly have no idea. While i seldom get charmed by shows and religiously watch them ASAP every week Dr Stone for me is something more than a simple charm.    From ep 1 i already gave the show a 10 on every episode. Sure some stuff like Psycho PassMononoke is far more mature, i think the target audience alienates them from being the best of the best.    Any point i would try to make would be a wasted effort when it still has half a season ahead of it and also the fact that this could be on the same boat of PN that has a single good first arc and then the rest of the story is garbage.    For being its first real directing work Iino Shinya is doing a fantastic job at delivering the punch lines and comedy so that already hits me at a soft spot since i tend to roll my eyes a lot when it comes to comedy. I think it has the potential to be the best of the best because i don't seem to grow tired of it unlike a lot of other shows that i have highly rated that suffer a lot during a rewatch.",1
592,"Thanks for the explanation, I hope that the rest will still hit all the right marks for you!",1
593,Jojo.,2
594,Wow i was under the impression that Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency aired on 2006 for some reason...,1
595,Didn't like the animation,0
596,Must be a large candlestick,2
597,"I can hear the manga author thinking: ""Well this is a science manga so they can't win with fighting they have to win with primitive science. Hoo boy, anime bullshit don't fail me now!""",0
598,Water lenses are a real thing though. You can find plenty of YouTube videos of them working.,2
599,"In Portuguese subtitles Chrome calls himself a ""cienceiro"" which means something like ""sciencian"" science + magician. Seeing as the English sub couldn't translate it this way hurts me a little lol.    It could also be translated as ""sciencerer"" science + sorcerer or ""sciencecaster"", 'science user' seems kinda bland to me.",1
600,"Well in Japanese it's ""kagaku tsukai"" so it's literally ""science user""",1
601,"Yes, but I would be better to use a make up word for it. In my opinion, of course. No need to downvote other people's comments just for that, lol",1
602,Well I didn't downvote you. But it's been science user from the beginning in the English subs so I guess that's what I'm used to and I think it works fine.,1
603,"I didn't necessarily think it was you, I was just saying. It works fine, it's that I didn't know that it was different in English subs and when I saw it I just wanted to point it out.",1
