0,"Well anime-only lads, we are finally through the  slightly weaker  prolouge arc,  congrats!   A few very important things from the episode that needs some highlighting:      As stated in the episode, Yuzuriha and Taiju will be gone for months years.   Taiju haters rejoice!   Back when the manga first came out, these last few chapters were the changing point where the focus really shifted to Senkuu, and the writer has started to expand the story properly.      The E=MC2 on Senkuu’s clothes was not just some „lolImsosmart” nonsense, it’s the anchor equation that keeps the petrification grounded in science, no matter how much it seems like magic  well, at least in this world..       The petrification is not just some layer, it turns you to stone completely. However, when people manage to break out of it, the outer layer of tissue was too degraded already to turn back to cells, resulting in the stone layer and the crack marks.      The petrification has amazing restorative capabilities, Yuhuriha even mentioned that they might be even capable of healing the reattached body parts. Which brings into question whether this petrification was an attack at all….      Fact: Kohaku is a miracle of nature    It’s going to get crazy from here, so buckle up, you are not ready for some of the stuff that is coming.",1
1,I'll miss Yuzuriha but Taiju would definitely have started to wear me down if he stayed around much longer.,1
2,Thanks for reposting your comment.,1
3,"The KohakuXSenku ship is sailing now.    I am hyped and I read up to this point too  and beyond it. I can't wait until we get to  ""Senku versus Chrome's ""sorcery battle"" and Chrome's arc as a whole. I am so excited to see science younger brother. The Kingdom of Science is being born!"" ",1
4,I was gonna ship them but they all put emphasis on her being very young so I didn’t know if I could.... Ruri and Senku seem cuter to me ,1
5,"Senku's only a year older than Kohaku psychically... and actually, at this point they're only a year apart in age. Senku's currently 17 at this point in time.",2
6,Yeah I googled it after my first comment... makes me wonder why everyone acts like she’s 12.     Anyway I felt the chemistry quickly died down between them. Is there more developed in the manga between them later?,2
7,"Some people just really wanna use an age difference to make it so people can't ship what they want, in order to make more people ship the ""less problematic"" one... or in canon, in particular with Tsukasa, probably not expecting anyone native period and her being young is part of that.    Definitely more development and you can view it however you like, but the manga does give them more development and it's fun. They fight like an old married couple and trust each other wholeheartedly.",1

9," ""people are theorizing about the survivors being underground. that's actually an interesting theory, but I can't wait for them to find out it's the other direction.""         hikariactually ",1
10,I really hope that gets covered this season. It would be a great thing to end on,1
11,"I was originally expecting it to be the mid-way point  episode 12 , but we just finished Volume 2 at episode 6, and that doesn't happen until volume 6 I believe.     I feel like the pace will probably pick up after this though tbh",1
12,"I'm honestly a bit confused about where the first season will end. At the start it looked like they will adopt a 2 chapter episode pace, which would have landed the end of episode 24 exactly at the start of the second major arc. But now that we are going with 3 chapter episode pace, I have no clue where would be a good end point...maybe at the  ""all-out sortie?"" ",2
13,"I'm guessing at the record, before the counter-offensive.",2
14,"Volume 4 actually. ;      I am so excited, I thought reading ahead would make the anime less exciting to watch but it's even better since some scenes have been executed better and with animation and voices those scenes just get better and better.",1
15,"ah, I just guessed based on Volume 6's cover lmao, it's been too long!        spinning     sounds perfectly reasonable to be the end of the cour then, seems like the perfect climax to keep people excited imo",1
16,Sounds about right to me. I really hope we already are signed on for multiple seasons cause we're gonna ten billion percent need them.,1
17,"My bet is that they will end the season on ""the record."" It's a strong emotional beat, and a good breaking point before they go fullspeed into the next large arc.",1

21,Fair enough.,1
22,"I’m anime-only.  Can someone explain how exactly the depetrification of the spot on his neck revived senku?  Was his neck cut, or was his spine just broken?  Was he technically dead for awhile, as he wasn’t breathing?  If he wasn’t breathing, did the depetrification also heal his brain from going an extended period without oxygen?  Does this imply that depetrifizing any small part of your body “heals” all other internal “injuries”?",2
23,"Not everywhere, just within the general vicinity. It healed both his broken spine and the head area. However the stone's power hasn't yet been fully expounded in the manga.",2
24,"When I read the manga at this point, I just took that Tsukasa's spear hit the stone on back of Senku's neck making loud crack sound, caused Tsukasa to believe that he've succeeded cracked Senku's neck.    Now, some hints has been flashed out in future arcs regards to nature of petrification, but still not fully explained yet.  ""Petrification has healing property  hence Senku said that it may not actually be an attack , it is possible that Senku's neck was broken that time, but as 'side effect' of depetrification, his neck healed along with it. So yes, Senku may actually be technically dead for a while."" ",2
25,I didn't recall Kohaku being so thirsty in the manga.,1

39, He wouldn't do that         evilgrin ,2
40,"This raises too many questions about digestive tracts and petrification.     Since Taiju was petrified with his mouth open, did dirt and debris build up in his throat and lungs?     What about the  undoubtedly thousands of  people who were petrified while pooping?",2

44,"Veins and bones are filled with blood and marrow, though. Also they're closed systems. The digestive tract is a hollow tube that goes through the middle of you. It's normally closed off by sphincters, but if they're open because you're yelling or pooping...",2

72,"For you and  u lindorm82 , you actually both touched on something I think is really important to note, because for as much as Dr;. Stone uses real chemistry and stuff, it's entire premise  no not people turning to stone  is based on a totally Un-scienfific misunderstanding that's unfortunately really common.    Which is that there's no such thing as a stone age, nor does civilization really even have steps to begin with.    Let me explain: The notion of a Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron age, etc originated in the early 1800's as a way to date artifacts found in europe in primitive archeology, when more reliable dating tools weren't available, as it was noticed you could roughly divide the sort of findings you'd get as being mostly stone, bronze, or iron remains. From there, it became more or less just a convenient way to split up European and Near Eastern history into milestones. What it is  not , and what people misunderstand it as, is stages human civilization ""advances"" through.    Simply because European and Middle Near Eastern civilization moved from one to the other does not mean they are set steps socities will go through. In real life, socitical progression is not like a Tech tree in Civilization where there's a singular path all socities go through and you need to unlock certain techologies before advancing  at least for the most part, obviously you aren't gonna invent the internet before computers or before electrcity, etc . In fact, dr. stone illustrates this: Senku is clearly able to to make use of Technologies that are far beyond a society in his condition are in simply because he knows about them, a society that happens upon the infoirmation can use it readily similarly.    Let's give a practical example: The civilizations of Mesoamerica, such as the Aztec and Maya.     They usually get labaled as ""Stone age"" societies, and, that, combined with the fact that public education about them is near exclusively focused on their conquest by the Spanish  though, ironically, it was  the native city-states and kingdoms themselves that actually did all the fighting  and the more bloody parts of their socity such as human sacrifice; most people are under the impression they are barely civilized, proto-civilizations having just acheived complex socities, just living in villages around pyramids and being surronded by tribal socities.    In reality, by the time the Spanish had arrived in Mexico, the region had those sort of proto-cities over 3000 years prior: By 1400 BC, there were sites with large pyramids, class systems, long distance trade, by 900 BC there was writing, and by 500 BC, formal state goverments and towns and cities had popped up all over the place.  I made  a summary from 1400BC all the way to 1519 when the spanish showed up here, which also delves into the lesser known but equally complex civilizatoons like the Zapotec, Mixtec, Teotihuacanos, Purepecha, etc here      These cities often had  complex, interconnected water management systems with aquaducts, resvoirs, and drainage networks, some even had toilets and running water     They had  formal, bureaucratic governments with courts and legal systems  from 1491 by Charles Mann shows, displaying deep symbolism, and touching on themes of mortality, the meaning of life, etc.    Under the Stone Bronze Iron age model, these socities, which clearly match the complexity and accomplishments of ones we see in the Eurasian Bronze and Iron ages, at times even Clasical Antiquity, and Medieval Europoe, would yet be considered ""Stone Age"", which I think is sort of obviously not a good assessment: Would Nomadic African tribes who used iron weapons but lived in villages, had simple cheifdoms, etc be ""more advanced"" purely because they used iron?  What does ""advanced"" even mean, there's multiple soilutions to solving human issues, after all. So instead have a  different timeline model     In short, human societies do not all progress along the same pathway, Geographic  no beasts of burden is a likely expanation for the limited wheel use, for instance , cultural, and political factors  early Iron tools and weapons in Eurasia were actually inferior to bronze ones, they only switched due to the instability of the Bronze age collapse  , and hell, even random chance all influence development and can cause socities to seem ahead or behind relative to how Europe developed.     -----------------------    This is actually a  short , condensed version of what i'd like toi post, but I'm in a rush right now. Actually interested in doing a longer, fleshed out post using more examples from Dr. Stone itself. Would love to get it published by an actual anime news publication site, If anybody has any ideas for sites that would accept pitches for using dr. stone as an example to talk about this sort of thing, let me know.",1
73,"I greatly appreciate this information you provided. A few months back I started reading up on Mesoamerica, more so focused around the Classic Period I believe, and had picked up a couple books: one being a copy of the Popol Vuh translated from the K'iche' by Michael Bazzett and Servant of the Underworld by Aliette De Bodard.    I'm not anywhere near a history buff like a best friend of mine is, but I wanted to make a story that involved their culture and mythology and I really enjoyed what I found. Reading your comment kind of clicked with me, even though I only knew less than a quarter of the things you supplies lol. That being said, thank-you!",1

76,You're welcome.,1
77,Is this a pasta?,2
78,"About half of it I typed up just now, about half of it adapted from prior comments of mine touching on the same subjects.",2
79,Loved it. Subscribe.,1
80,Bruh anything can be a pasta with the right attitude,1
81,"I... Don't really know.    If this guy is who I think he is then no, it isn't pasta but one weirdo spamming this everywhere  personally I've mostly seen it in MAL  and this is the least weird thing he posts, if that tells you anything about the guy.",2
82,"What about this post makes this guy a weirdo though? It was extremely informative, and mostly on topic to Dr. Stone. Isn't this kind of tangential information exactly what discussion threads are for? I'd hope the point isn't just for people to spam their favorite quote, or argue over who their favorite waifu is using templated memes and copypastas.",1
83,"The spamming part, I would assume. Information isn't weird, it's what you do with it that can become weird.    And it sounds like he's saying the guy spamming this was already a weirdo, not that this post made him a weirdo.",2
84,"The spamming part and  again,  if  this guy is the one I think he is  the other comments not-related to the post itself.      Also, this post is certainly not on topic for Dr. Stone. It's a longass rant about why ""stone age"" is a stupid term when the meaning Dr. Stone is trying to convey is not affected in any way or form.",2
85,"I don't use MAL, so no, not whoever that is. I really only post here on reddit, sometimes on youtube and imgur, etc.     Though now i'm curious: Could you link the MAL posts you mean?",2
86,It’s to specifically relevant to be a pasta.,2
87,"I don't think anyone actually thinks society goes through stages like that. Maybe i'm wrong and you run into a lot of idiots, but i think it's pretty common knowledge that terms like stone age, etc. are just generalizations based on the level of technology widely used in that vague period of time.",2
88,"     You went on a massive rant, but you never justified this claim in the slightest.    The best you did was  disprove  this claim by talking about how senku is very obviously using technology that is much more advanced than you would expect.    I also don't really see anything in dr Stone that enforces this ""stone, bronze, iron, etc."" progression at all?    It's just people using primitive technology because it's all they currently can make with the resources they have.",0
89,"You are talking about  sophistication  while the "" whatever  age"" is more about the available   materials science  . You can do a lot of things without using metals but it is much less than the equivalent if you had the same knowledge  and  metalworking. Simply put you can't have an advanced society beyond a certain point if you don't develop metalworking and that's shown by all civilizations over human history. Some developed metalworking and continued to improve while others  like the mesoamericans you are so fond of naming  capped at a certain level.",1
90,"If you read their post, you would know that multiple mesoamerican civilisations   did   develop metal working, but due to various factors  the superior sharpness of obsidian, the lack of available tin deposits e.t.c.  developed very differently to European civilisation. What's not to say that a Mesoamerican civilisation wouldn't develop something like the computer, given another 400 years?  Since ""European"" civilisation didn't develop computers for another 400+ years afters the conquistadors .",2
91,"Because you need semi conductors, copper cables and more? All of which require extensive metal working.    A lot of modern science required very specific and very high strength components, most of which were metal until not short ago  and mostly still are, but there id some more variety due to plastics and advanced ceramics .       I mean, how would you develop automated mass production without machines for example? Or just any form of non-giagantic complex machinery? Or not even so complex, how would you make a cannon or a musket without iron steel?    Because if  you  had read the post I was responding to you would notice the guy said they did develop the  basics  of metalworking and didn't expand upon it. So saying they had ""metalworking"" is the equivalent of saying that humanity knew how to work iron because some people could hammer meteoritic iron into useful shapes.",2
92,"My point is that there's not any reason that technology   had   to develop the cannon or any other weapon, that just happened to be what did develop. What's not to say there wouldn't have been some other technological advance from mesoamerica given another 400 years?",2
93,"Nothing by what is not to say that they wouldn't develop advanced metalworking as a necessity? A lot of the cultures that survived well into the conquest of the Americas  did  develop those techniques and make quite a good use out of them. Like many andean peoples, who used swords and even some forms of firearms.    Technological development is not  lineal  but it is still quite limited. There are only so many things physics  and economics  allow you to do. There are only so many solutions to the same problems.",1
94,"Uhhyou are aware that mechanical computers existed long before electronic computers right?         And no they were working on metalworking, just because their metalworking had not reached the same level of sophistication as that found in Eurasia does not mean they had not improved upon their own techniques.    Quite frankly your views reek of a rather Eurocentric view of history and human development.",0
95,"Mechanical computers which are either made of metal  because that's the only way to make them  relatively  small  or that would be titanac monstrosities with the processing power of a calculator  and that's assuming a much more advanced level of sophistication than mechanical computers even enjoyed in real life .      About the cannons. From your link.         And then goes to say that they were mostly reinforced with metal in most cases, either steel iron rings or a coated interior.    Also, this is trying to evade the point because it's the equivalent os saying ""I can make a crewed rocket! Well, they  do  blow up after reaching orbit but they totally count as spaceships, right?""           Isn't this changing the goalposts? ""They don't have metalworking and they don't need it"" is now ""they did have it, just not as good"".             Ah yes, the classic ad hominem. Never miss you.     Come back when you have a real arguement.",0
96,"     Fallacy fallacy, does this mean I win?    Also I should point out that that was not an ad hominem, I did not attack your character, merely your views.",0
97,"It's not you who is stupid, your beliefs are.      And no, I'm totally not attacking you.    EDIT: Also, it's interesting to see that you didn't answer any of my other points.",0
98,How it's saying that your views reek of bias are an ad hominem?,0
99,"The problem is that people do not use ""Stone Age"", ""Bronze Age, ""Iron Age"" etc purely as a description of a society's materials science capabilities, but an overall assessment of a society's overall complexity, assuming that because X society does or doesn't use Bronze it will be as or less complex then Eurasian Bronze age socities overall, etc.    Even from a pure materials science perspective I don't think it's as solid a framework as you might imply. As I mentioned, early Iron tools and weapons were inferior to prior bronze ones. The Andeans like the Inca had rather impressive understanding of tensile physics and did stuff with rope and cloth that wasn't possible using iron or steel in europe at the time. And as mentioned, Obsidian, while more fragile then metal, is many, many times sharper.    I obviously don't deny that for some technologies you do need certain prior ones to develop them, of course that's true, but you could just as easily divide that sort of progression by transportation technology  land, sea, air  rather then materials science, and to  intrinsically  claim that Iron is more advanced then Bronze or even that Bronze is more advanced then Stone is less an objective assessment and more valuing certain mechanical properties and with that valueset in mind, Iron is better then Bronze and Bronze is better then Stone. There's also the issue that a tool or weapon or construction project can be more or less complex independent of material choice: If you get a big chunk of iron and just beat it into a rough point and stick it onto the end of a wooden shaft, that's not a more complex or more advanced weapon then a spear with stone points and edges where a ton of ex pertise and fine craftsmenship went into locating the right quality stone, knapping it expertly to the exact shape you need, carving the wood to have a specifijc form and shape to achieve a specific utilitarian purpose where said design was refined over centuries of tweaking and adjustments, etc.    And while I agree that without using metal tools or weapons they would eventually hit some hard limitations, I would dispute the idea that the Mesoamericans had hit a ""cap"" yet. For reference, I'll point you to  this  summary of Mesoamerican hisotry I made from the first site in 1400BC with monumental archtecture, class systems, etc, to 1519 when the Spanish showed up.     Just in the Mesoamerican Postclassic Period, from 900 to 1519 AD, there had been a number of notable technological and social improvements. and changes. In reference to this conversation, Metallurgy is one of them: Metallurgy first occured in Mesoamerica around 600AD, likely spread up through Central America, and over the next 600 years or so was limited to gold, silver, and copper working with some aresenic based alloys and was relatively simplistic, despite the fact that as mentioned, even prior to the introduction of metallurgy, you had extremely complex water mangement and hydralic systems, huge cities even by contemporary european standards, etc. By around 1200 AD, Bronze smelting had been developed and you see more complex alloys as well as metalworking techniques in general, producing pretty fine pieces like this  Aztec serpent labret with an articulated tongue .    Other examples would be political and adminstrative complexity. I'm going to be somewhat reductive and generalizing here; and what I say will be most applicable to the Classical Maya and Postclassical Aztec, since as mentioned the region had dozens of major civilizations at any given time and hundreds of different specific states with their own structure, but generally speaking the Mesoamerican states of the classical period were theocracies where the priestly class held most political power domestically and kings were seen as divine or semi-divine figures with dynastic rule, often with rulers installing their own family members in conquered cities and a reliance on that and political marriages to cement their inter-state political authority. This is pretty similar to what you see, say, Ancient Egypt or Bronze age Mesopotamia; States still had formal goverments and judicial systems, some govermental offices, and organized armies, but there were generally not huge bureaucratic institutions with tons of moving parts;     In the Mesoamerican postclassic, by contrast, especially in the late-postclassic, rule became more secular and domestical political power structure of goverments more often aligned with soldiers, with more formal monarchies or oligarchies where the nobility made decisions or voted in kings: The Aztec captial of Tenochtitlan for instance had a de facto royal family, but the nobles voted in the next king and did on occasions vote out incompetent rulers  on one occassion even assassinating them . You also saw formal republics, such as Tlaxcala, which was a unified republic of 4 main city states with a collective senate, unlike Tenochtitlan's oligarchical system, having senatoroial positions open to commoners by merit if they underwent the appropriate legal and ethical training. Bureaucratic  complexity increased as well: Tenochtitlan for instance, obviously, had a huge economic network stretching across hundreds of towns and cities, a hierachy of tax and economic officials, and a similarly complex institutions with many civil offices for it's religious administration, judicial system, with multiple levels of state appellate courts, and military, which had a large formal rank structure, elite units and knigtly orders for nobles, armories, garrasions, barracks, etc; as well as municipal goverments for city districts with their police force, local court, and school. On that note, there was actually state mandated public education for all children regardless of social class or gender, though nobles had access to better schools were formal philsophers, poets, theolians taught and there were lessons on writing, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, science, etc rather then just basic history, poetry, morals, and religion  and martial training for boys and domestic skills for girls  for commoners. And on that note, they were also in a bit of an intellectual golden age: as mentioned, Philosophers, poets, etc taught at elite schools, but also formed their own intellectual circles and we even see some indications of stuff like political satire, etc.     I could go on  such as in population scales and envoirmental agricultural yields, and how even the most densely populated area wasn't even close so hitting it's carrying capacity yet  but bottom line Mesoamerica was not stagnating or hitting a cap in any regard yet, perhaps aside from the limitations not having beasts of burden placed on long distance adminstration and military campaigns, though even in those regards socities adapted and came up with novel solutions and alternatives.",2

If anything, Senku talked about accelerating all the way to ""weapons of science"" in the form of guns, which would have expedited invention well past the bronze or iron age. I think the invention in the shows is driven by circumstance and knowledge, which is principally how human civilizations have always developed. We are limited by what we have access to and the knowledge we have at the time.     Like I said, I appreciate your explanation, but I think the conclusions the commenters above came to were because of their own misunderstandings that they have developed from other sources and not because of the premise of the show.",1

No, I can't, but the United States actually had their own River Valley civilization, the Mississipians who had had dozens of sedentary towns and even cities with some degree of class systems and political relationships, large-scale monumental archtecture, etc, and their structures were purely wood and earthenworks; no stone.    They never reached the level of complexity you see in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, or the Andes in general, since Europeans and their diseases wiped them out only a few hundred years after first developing into complex socities, but their largest site,  Cahokia, had 30,000 to 40,000 people , which is, to compare then to Eurasia, huge by Bronze age standards and still very sizable by Iron age or Classical Antiquity standards; and may have had a formal state government.     Had they not been wiped out it's entirely possible they wouled have gone onto use stone archtecture, of course. To be clear I'm not stating that litterally every facet of society is optional and there's no baseline prequisites, and fundamentally the fact we DO see complex socities share so many political, cultural, archtectural, etc conventions and frameworks shows that a lot of this is stuff most socities will develop via convergent evolution, but my point is is that it's a mistake to purely judge things based on the european path of progression when we see historically that other groups don't to various degrees.",2
113,"I have bit trouble grasping the essence of your comments.    I think it is ok to use the term stone world, because it symbolizes the very first steps that are needed to form a society. stone tools  I don't see where this implys a fixed order of future steps.     Maybe you are refering to the part in the anime where Senku is talking about skipping those steps? I thought that those are just the scientific steps of finding a hypothesis and refuting it.     ;    After thinking a bit about it, it could be that this anime is going to show us the different ways of building a society with only stone tools but with different moral systems. One of them will stay with stone tools and will focus on improving other things while the other one will primarily focus on developing better tools until the tools are good enough to level out the inequality in strentgh. But somehow i think that they will focus on Tsukasas ruler complex.",2
114,     People don't do that though? They don't think it's literally a videogame skill tree. It's just a rough generalisation.,2
115,Plenty of people unironically do see it that way.,2

119,Holy shit! You're the guy from the zaibatsu's subreddit!!!! Nice to see you here too. And thank you for the wonderful post.,1
120,That I am!,1
121,Can I ask how or what led you to get so into Mesoamerican history? Like I agree that it is absolutely interesting and we can learn a lot about humans by studying pre-columbian american civilizations and what not because they were so isolated from eurasia. But how did you specifically come to slam into this stuff?,2
122,"As a kid I was enamored with the visual design in Dreamworks movie The Road to El Dorado  which, despite not even trying to really be accuracate and having a lot of errors, is honestly still one of the only pieces of mainstream media I know of that accurately shows them as functioning, urban socities, not just orgies of blood and violence or tribes  which stuck with me a lifelong attachment to Mesoamerican aesthetics, but I still never really knew more about those cultures then anybody else.    A few years back, probably 2012 2013  so I guess not ""a few"", how time flies  I got into Civilization 5, and was reading the Civililopedia entries for the Aztec and Montezuma II, and I was sort of mind blown by how much cool stuff it talked about and how much history and information it had: You get taught virtually nothing of these socities in schools, and get the impression that we have no information, but to have the names of specific rulers, information about specific wars, and, of course, the fact that Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities in the world at the time, and was litterally built on a lake with venice like canals running through it, gardens all over the city, etc got me hooked.    So from there I started doing further reading and looked for more information. I eventually found my way to  r AskHistorians , and voraciously read pretty much any point or comment I could find there, which gave me a decent emough foundation of actual information to then do further reading on my own without being totally lost and being able to spot obviously bad sources.     In the past year or two in particular i've tried to really get into actual scholarly academic papers and studies as well as books by researchers, as well as network with said people as well over twitter, etc. I'd like to be able to pursue studying it academically but my life situation is sort of awful and i'm not sure it's worth it. As of now it's purely a hobby.",1
123,"Wow dude. That is pretty cool and in a way, inspirational. I hear you on schools not teaching a lot of history, well at least before the revolutionary war. I was so surprised after getting into CK2 and EU4 how much history I didn't know, so I also got into reading into history from video games. However, the precolumbian societies were an area I never really heard or knew much about. I know you had the special flair on the zaibatsu's sub and saw you talking about this stuff there and then to see you in an episode discussion for an anime I figured I would straight up ask you because it sounded like you were a professional historian from the way you structured your posts and what not. As to your life situation man, I know that sucks. I've been there. I was homeless for a little while after getting out of the army, but things can get better as long as your vigilant when the opportunity comes to see the opportunity. But in the meantime I don't know if you are aware, as most people seem not to be, but here in America at least, the majority of the top universities in the country make their courses availible for free online. Granted, it doesn't count toward any degree or accreditation but it is available for pure learning.  MIT  and many others also provide a plethora of opencourse learning online. Maybe this would be something you'd be interested in. In the mean time, Thank you for your well put together and educational reddit posts on these not-too-well known societies. Best of luck dude.",1
124,"Damn, how much more advanced could our current world's society be if these Mesoamerican societies had been left to their own devices smfh, fucking Conquistadors set all of humanity back.",1
125,"This but unironically. There were even European inventions that re-invented mesoamerican technology, like using ceramics for their sharper cutting edges  in a tradeoff for their brittleness  compared to metal.",1
126,"First the disease would have still spread and killed almost all of the people it did. Europeans did not know modern knowledge on desease. This huge die off would have collapsed the civilizations like it did the great Amazon Civilization  it was not a Jungle Wilderness  and the Amazon Civilization disappeared with it's only contact with Conquistadors being peaceful as they traveled though to the sea.     2nd the Mesoamerican societies were military Empires just like the Spanish, morally there was not a huge difference both sides were in the might makes right mode and the Aztecs were taking huge numbers of prisoners to sacrifice.    I am quite sure the Mesoamerican societies would have treated Europe the same way the Europeans treated them if shoe on other foot.     The loss of culture was tragic but I know of few practical things the Mesoamericans came up with that were not done by China and Western Civilizations.   With a bit better luck, the Spanish only won though extremely good luck, the Mesoamerican societies would have thrown the Spanish out and held for awhile especially if English help was arranged like when Francis Drake went by that region on his around the world trip. Then cultural exchange would have prevented a few Spanish nutty religious extremists from destroying lots of records that Rome actually ordered saved and sent to them. Normal Catholic Church policy was to lock away pagan records for further study not destroy them, but keeping the type of extremist who tends to be in outlaying areas has always been a problem. Not that the church did not ban and burn books it just always kept copies for it's self normally.   Conquest India and other places style would probably still occurred but that would have left local leaders and culture still mostly intact. This type of conquest was getting local leaders to recognize your supremacy while still leaving the local leaders in charge.",2
127,"I mean, most of their collapse was due to disease iirc.  Societies don't do so well when plagues wipe out 50%+ of it over an extended period of time.",2
128,The disease was brought up from Spain so...,2
129,"Yes tying a civilizations level to just metal technology is rather stupid. I would suppose they were just copying in a way the Ancient world's Gold, Silver and Bronze age ideas of their past.  I think Iron actually regressed civilization in some ways for awhile because of the wave of conquests with it cause loss of greater civilizations.   Civilization mainly a military game and thus military oriented in advancement of technologies. Civilization though is in error things done in Mesopotamians are not possible without Bronze or Iron.     I have considered these Civilizations superior to the Spanish in most ways but Spain was fairly backwards only having the advantage of military technology and a huge force of unemployed warriors as the Reconquest of Spain had just finished. Morally the Aztects sort of deserved it, the hate of the other groups is what made them lose. And I know The Aztects would have treated the Spanish just as badly as they treated other groups if they had won and say already had disease resistance from earlier contact with the West. Dang Vikings you did not push on or tell anyone else in Europe what you found. And it was possible for Roman period ships to reach and contact then would have changed everything. Unfortunately for them the Mesopotamians did not catch an exploring bug or get enough Polynesian contact  if any  to get a long range sailing option.    Edit to add with some disease resistance and say British help the Civilizations of Mesopotamia did have a military structure that probably could have equaled Europeans ones once they had firearms. Unlike primitive cultures their troops did fight in formations in a organized way. One favorite read of youth is where the Aztec Empire Controlled everything past the Mississippi with Europe Dominated government to the east of it.",2
130,"     Would you consider it safe to say the ""advanced-ness"" of  pre-industrial civilizations  should be based on how complex the society itself is rather than what technology they have access to? Obviously, as you pointed out, the Aztecs were rather advanced, but from the current view, they lacked the ability to make iron, therefore they were 'less advanced than Europe.'  when in reality they should be viewed about the same     I think the fault in the ""             Age"" model is due to the fact that the use of it started after the industrial revolution, when technology really started to kick off. From this perspective, societies without industrial tech are less advanced,  which is a true statement  and back tracking from this result in;    Internet  ",2
131,"I mean like you said he's using these ages as guidelines, probably for organizational purposes  Because Europe was arguably the most advanced set of civilisations throughout history    Even Japan was in a hurry to catch up when the Europeans came back at the end of their Meiji Era because they realised how utterly outclassed they were    And another point is that the Europeans were also undeniably the most scientifically innovative and advanced which is a big YES for Senku    Edit: Hey at least I'm now an expert on Mesoamerican history after that lesson",2

195,"     This is why they're professionals and you're not.    You know what else is basic? Not drawing eyes as absolutely retarded as anime eyes in general, they look nothing like real eyes. Why do they do it? Because that's what abstraction is, and people think it looks cool.    The anime girls that you think look cute probably look retarded to people who have never seen anime before and aren't used to it.    And no one magically woke up one day and started drawing anime. It's a slow process of trial and error trying out new and different things and seeing if they work out. We wouldn't have anime as it is today if people were too afraid to draw things ""wrong"".    You may know the basic rule of ""1 eye space in between the eyes"", but you may also find it interesting that there is supposed to be around 1 eye space between the eye and the edge of the head. Which that example you posted breaks.    Not to mention the eyes are so fucking big that the eye sockets of the skull would be absolutely massive, and the face gets smushed down so much that the mandible of anime girls could be smashed with a slight bump.    Everything about them is ""incorrect""",0
196,"Anybody who has seen animated cartoon is already familiar with stylised disproportionate designs, it's not an anime exclusive thing.",2
197,"Just because you have seen abstracted forms before doesn't mean being familiar with all possible forms of abstraction.    Picasso saw truth in his paintings whilst most normies will, at best,  pretend  like they understand the mess of shapes that he painted.    ""Not photo realism"" is not a style. And anime is very different to conventional western style sensibilities.",0
198,"There are rules that you can break and there are ones that you can bend and also ones that you can't.      The point being, Boichi's female designs look weird to almost everyone because the eye distances are too big. And just by looking, it's obvious where the problem lies. An average Joe can point out the off-looking eye distance.     That's why it's so baffling to me why someone who draws for a living and probably familiar with facial structures can't see this. He can design male characters just fine, after all.",0
199,"     1. You're wrong. There is nothing objective about it, it is just a matter of taste    2. Do you suppose someone just woke up one day and figured out how to draw anime? The only way to figure out what ""works"" is to try out different things and see if they succeed of fail.         Nope, they don't look weird to ""almost everyone"". There are people who are expressing their love for the designs, and the people who don't care won't bother writing comments about their lack of caring.         I already explained it to you mate, did you not read?    It's a matter of fucking taste. Once again even the anime facial structures that you like are FUCKED UP and 'wrong'.     You have a bad case of the dunning krueger effect. You're too lacking in knowledge of the arts to even realise how little you understand.    Anime characters do not follow a strict set of anatomical rules that  must  be followed, that is not how art styles work. Just because  you  don't like the style does not make it 'wrong'.

247,"if true, she could never speak current japanese. the language would have evolved",2
248,"This seems like a really bad plan. Tsukasa isn’t dumb by any means. Hell, he’s the second smartest character we’ve seen so far. Taiju and Yuzuriha are good people and Yuzu isn’t dumb, but it seems like it would be easy for Tsukasa to see through them. And they’ll be in ever constant danger. Will be interesting to see where that goes.",1

266,  Who petrified the world?      Who the FUCK made this soundtrack.,1
267,Late to the party but I got you!!  Tatsuya Kato  w  Hiroaki Tsutsumi and Yuki Kanesaka.      The music style sounded very similar to Free! so I absolutely HAD to check halfway through the first episode  ,1
268,Dude I LOVE this show. One episode a week is sooooo slow though.,1
269,God ikr    I wanna watch it ALL right now! Its so good,1
270,First episode: Why are there bagpipes in Doctor Stone?    Now: FUCK YEAH BAGPIPES THIS SOUNDTRACK IS A GODDAMN BANGER,2
271,Bag Pipes + Freestyle Rap is a surprisingly effective combination.,1
272,"Bagpipes + anything is fucking great.    Bagpipes and hiphop?   Good.     Bagpipes and metal?  Great     Bagpipes and EDM?   Sure, why not.     And my personal favorite,  bagpipe covers of classical music. ",1

281,It’s actually insanely good. I love it,1
282,"They said the thing again except Taiju said it! Yay!    Tsukasa is still kind've a dick, but hey at least Senku got to show his amazing science skills. Kohaku is probably my 5th favorite character in the entire series and I'm really happy we didn't have to wait forever to get to her. She is truly best girl.    I think the creators had way too much writing the scenarios for how the petrifaction possibly happened. Their so ridiculous, I love it. Also, I loved the shot where we see Taiju and Senku in mechs against Tsukasa and Yuzuhira just looks so cute in her own 'mech'.     Overall, I gotta give major props got TMS thus far. The animation, while not the most impressive this season, it's still really good and they capture Boochi's face perfectly.",1
283,"     My money is on ironically, a person doing it for the benefit of humanity. One scenario could be that someone concluded global warming was too far advanced, and that the only method of preserving humanity was drastic action. Replace global warming with virus or other dangers for possible contingencies. The healing properties are too beneficial to be a fluke. It practically looks like immortality.",1

285,"That's a really good way to write a boring villain, and a really hard way to write a good one.",1
286,Oh the conflict as real life villains are mostly the boring types. Realism or a good story.,1
287,"Yoshikage Kira is an amazing, disturbed villain. But yeah, it's rare.",1
288,Senku even said it this episode.,1
289,The fact that it was questioned whether or not it was actually an attack more or less confirms to me that it wasn't. You're probably on the right track.,1
290,That is the scenario this episode seems to put a lot of emphasis on.,1
291,"Kohaku's your 5th favorite character? well there are only 5 relevant characters right now anyway  Senku's group,Tsukasa , and her ",1
292,He’s probably a manga reader. In my top 5 characters only Senku and now Kohaku have been shown in the anime.,1

307,You need 2 to agree to sale a ship.,2
308,"Well, I guess that's a goodbye to Taiju and Yuzuhira for now. Hopefully we get to see them a bit in the future just to see how they're doing.    Kohaku's already an interesting character, since as Tsukasa deduced she seems to be of a generation born after the events of the petrification. It's sort of a neat what-if regarding a person of the common age meeting someone of the stone-age, how would the abundance of knowledge and technology affect them?",1
309,     I need more of these precious goofballs        toradorasalute ,1
310,Definitely. Goofballs help make things lighter so it's not heavy all the time. Plus they were endearing in their own way.,1
311,I figured she was born post stone age since she had no crack lines on her.,2
312,"Oh damn, didn't notice that.",1
313,Nice job!,1
314,"I don't get the ""generation born after events of petrification"" thing. How were they born when everyone was petrified?",2
315,"I think Tsukasa is making the assumption that others have likely woken up earlier before even Senku did. That would mean that they had children that were brought into this stone world and don't know anything about the civilization of old.    This at least seems consistent with how Kohaku doesn't know anything about Gunpowder and seems to think Tsukada was angering a Mountain Spirit, as well as her not knowing what a pulley system is.",2
316,"     Well you see. . . when a rock man, and a rock lady, love each other  very  much. . .",2
317,Have you considered the possibility that maybe senku  wasn't  the only one unpetrified?,2
318,She still infected by modern Nudity Taboo otherwise she probably be wearing a loin cloth at most.,2

321,My apologies. My recall was faulty because the men being shirtless it seams without reviewing the whole thing seams to only be temporary when found otherwise they are wearing shirts. And they are wearing shirts when finding the new girls so I can't draw the conclusion I just drew yet.,0
322,"The little callbacks and the tiny things are the best part of Dr Stone, why does science boy have E=mc squared written on his clothing?  To let you know he's science boy of course but WHY he himself wrote it is such a nice touch, because the how and why of him escaping is tied up in that formula.",1

324,Einstein is best girl.,1

328,"I cringed when he deliberately cut himself like that AND rub the wound against unsanitized surface.    In his situation, one weak infection is good enough to end him.",0
329,But he has soap,1
330,"he didn't have soap in the flashback , he only aquired it after both Taiju & Tsukasa were revived.",2
331,He could've acquired it any time he wanted to in the case it was needed.,2
332,"you're wrong , he couldn't do it by himself , because of his weak stamina , he needed Taiju's help to collect & crush shells in order to make soap.",1
333,Taiju only sped up the process. Collecting and crushing shells isn't some monumental task.,2
334,"""I'm surprised you could write so legibly on your own butt!""",2
335,"Yeah at first I cringed at that because I thought they are all getting edgy Shounen-y by showing off the formula on Science boi's clothes.     That's why the scene was my favourite one today. The realization to the roots of science and him engraving it on his clothes to never forget that, they really established how powerful science is by that quite well.",0
336,     I mean he did bite his own thumb and write the formula in blood for god-knows-what reason.,0
337,"ink dye takes time to make, blood is readily available.",2
338,Infections are also readily available,0
339,He has   Dr. Stone   soap though.,2
340,But he didn’t have much limestone until Taiju woke up,2
341,Soap,2
342,It was probably to get himself pumped up. He will be quite lonely after all.,2
343,I thought he might've used his blood to test with the formula for the petrification potion so he might as well use it to write something before it heals up.,2
344,"I said this when we first saw his outfit, but this is exactly what happens when you have a smart character written by a stupid author. ""Just sprinkle a little math on there; science nerds love math!"" And then they use the only equation they know  but don't understand ...    I'm really glad they ended up subverting this by giving him both a reason to write math on his shirt, and a reason to use that equation specifically.",1
345,Thankfully the author puts a shitton of work into Dr. Stone. He often goes on a 1-2 week break just to gather scientific source material.,1
346,I thought the same thing. There was a little cringe when I first noticed it but......ok.....it's tied into his character enough to be somewhat believable to me at this point. Just enough to suspend a little disbelief. I'm really enjoying this show.,1
347,Don't mention many hypothesis on Dark Energy to him. Short version Universe is expanding at a accelerating rate and thus if Energy is causing it the Energy is coming into the Universe or being created and either way as far as this universe is concerned Energy is being created. Of course this knowledge is of no use in this shows story probably.   Credit to PBS Space time were I go to have my mind blown into tiny parts frequently. Learning some understanding of relativity or Quantum Mechanics will do that.,1
348,Basically 'Quantum mechanics forbids this',2
349,PBS Space Time is great. I like to be subscribed to it so I can pretend I understand it.,1
350,"when I first saw that I remember thinking how dumb it was, and it's still dumb, but I'm glad that they at least went back and justified it.",1
351,"I love it when anime's integrate their ED song into the final scenes of the episode, it makes the scene + the song so much more memorable whenever they do that. I got goosebumps when Senku dropped from the tree and the song kicked in full blast.",1
352,"Same here, that was definitely the money shot of the episode. The way his clothes flowed as he leaped down. You can tell a LOT of love was put into that sequence.",1
353,I still sometimes replay the scene in Jojo where Joseph machineguns Straizo.,2
354,Or Zeppeli's sacrifice to the opening notes of Roundabout.    HAve you seen Flowers of Evil? In that one they do it every single episode and it is awesome  in a dark way ,1
355,"Hunter x Hunter flashbacks, especially second ED.     DORE HODOU",1
356,Fuck the Hunter x Hunter ED song riff that started at the very end of the episodes made me so fucking hyped EVERY SINGLE TIME. Especially during the Yorknew arc.,1
357,Gundam has that alot.,2
358,I remember how impactful the scene in episode 23 of Re:Zero was where Julius has to kill Subaru while the ED played in the background. You're right about both the scene and the song becoming more memorable,1
359,How am I not noticing the music everyone's raving about? I don't remember a thing about it. o o,1

369,"well i mean what else is she supposed to do? shes got a 1 ton tree laying on her, and her back is on rock. So it isn't like she can dig her way out. Plus even though we know there are probably other people out there in the world, we don't know how many. She could have been on a long hunting trip and be days away from her village",2
370,"and she doesnt look like she has any way to signal that she is in trouble, so for her village, they will only send help only after too long have passed and if senku hasnt come by, well, she is dead.     That's the thing that hit me, without all these modern communication tool, when you are in trouble, well, hello death, nice to meet cha.",2
371,"That parallel sequence was real nice, i absolutely love their brolationship lol.",1
372,They really believe  in each other.         aliens ,1
373,Those aliens should be our new Snuu's,2
374,"Splitting up, can't say I saw that coming. Though dealing with an opponent like Kraven a little left field thinking will have to do. I mean as long as Taiju and Yuzuriha can convince him that them coming back to him is their only option for survival now.      But more importantly Ayla finally showed up  Que the theme music: ",1
375,"I think you mean Tsukasa  Kraven  and Kohaku  Ayla , right?",2
376,Of course. I've just given them fun nicknames to refer to them as instead cuz of how much they remind me their namesakes. Kind of a running joke gag thing I ended up doing. Which reminds me I forgot that I nicknamed Senku Celeryhead  from King of the Hill  during the first episode and haven't been using it. Oh well it's not that important.,1
377,"I recently started chrono trigger and only just reached the part with ayla, im glad i can get that reference now",1
378,Well that's good to hear. And have fun with Chrono Trigger.,1

Going to a tree immediately after it falling with that beast of a man he was trying to avoid potentially nearby didnt seem too logical.    glad to see this is where the story is really supposed to kick off though, wonder how she got unpetrified as well as the other characters in the promitional art.",2
381,I think some time must have bassed between the tree falling onto Kohaku and  Senkuu arriving ,2
382,"I mean, it takes time for Senku to run to her from when he heard the tree falling. He was above some cliff or something when he heard saw it.    Also, we can be sure Senku got there analyzing the environment surroundings.",2
383,"And with the girl just calmly lying there looking like she gave up on life, I think we can assume she had been there trying to escape for some time before finally realizing she couldn't.",2
384,"When it implies a potential waifu, even if a man isn't aware, logic and rationality won't prevail.",2
385,"He's logical, but he also wants to save people. He's not going to let someone die. I doubt he even wants to kill Tsukasa",2
386,"Well he knew the only trouble could be Tsukasa and another person, and he knew Taiju and Yuzuriha were in the opposite direction.    Edit: forgot to mention that he has to meet the person smoke signaling him too",2
387,"Yeah but the whole plan is to keep from Tsukasa finding out he's still alive, so running right into a situation where Tsukasa likely would be was undoubtedly a bad idea. He's just lucky he didn't run into him.",2
388,He knew he needed the person who smoke signaled him,2
389,And so he should have waited. No point in finding the person who sent the smoke signal if he ran into Tsukasa and got killed again.,2
390,"The logical thing to do would have been to lie to Tsukasa about going along with smashing statues and then poison him or slit his throat while he slept.    Senku isn't a man of cold logic though, hes a bleeding heart when you get down to it. That's why he's determined to save everyone and why he rushed in when he thought someone was in danger.",2
391,"What are you talking about ""Unpetrified?"" Tsukasa literally asked what generation she was. Obviously some people woke up long enough ago that there is a primitive human population around.",2
392,"To be honest, Tsukasa was most likely 100% focused on getting back to the cave, which I'm sure Senku would've recognized.     The moment the tree fell, he was probably miles away",2
393,"Don't know where you got the idea that he's supposed to be super logical. Science and logic might be his  method , but his  motive  is the inherently illogical drive to save   everyone  . Meaning if he thinks someone is in trouble, he'll always rush in to try and save them regardless of the danger to himself or the ""greater good.""",2
394,     It's a pretty wild spoiler tbh,2
395,I mean instead of a giant pulley system he could have just dug a few inches under her to slide her out... So he's only as smart as the writing requires.,2
396," Kohaku Stitch     There's really something about Boichi's  female  designs that really appeals to me, and I can't really explain what it is for some reason.     Kohaku is certainly interesting. She's basically proof that Senku isn't the first person to have awaken.  Her being second generation  would mean it's likely that there's more people awake out there that has already built a small civilization. I mean it would make sense, it's not like you can only get nitric acid from bat guano. Definitely interested to know more about her!",1
397, the duality of man ,2

422,"Crazy thing is, the anime actually toned down the uncanny factor quite a bit.",0
423,Probably because Boichi is a former hentai artist.,2

460,"I mean, there's a reason they don't. For as much science as there is in this show, there's also a ton of not-science.     If you only have fifty minutes to teach a class, spending forty of those minutes on world-building and character drama that has nothing to do with the class just to get to the parts where Senku explains some concepts that are hyper-specific to this incredibly unlikely situation he finds himself in.     Don't get me wrong, it's cool as fuck, but without the actual story surrounding it, it would be the same as any other lecture. If you crafted a show around everything you'd realistically need to know for a course exam, that would be a pretty boring show, in fact they did used to make edutainment crap like that. Trust me, it was barely any better than a standard lecture. If anything, it was more patronizing.     Shows with a lot of science are only cool because of the stories that surround them, and because they often focus on the edgy cool parts of science, like the effects of drugs and chemicals, making weapons, making cures and antidotes to poisons or survival knowledge.     Honestly the best classes are just the ones run by passionate teachers who knew how to make the boring bits more interesting. And can explain concepts in concise ways.     I know you probably weren't being entirely serious but I see this sentiment crop up a lot whenever some anime has this perceived educational value and I think it helps to take a step back and contextualize its actual usefulness in that regard.",1
461,"Yea i agree. Shows like this help to inspire people. But if you actually already want to learn it then its much better to get a higher information story ratio. A litlle bit of story is good, so you can remember it better. Doing practical things will create such a faked real life story.",1

Introduces a great new dynamic. Who are they? How will they react to Senku's knowledge? What will Senku Teach them? Can't wait to find out.",1
470, in another world with my   smartphone   precocious high school scientist ,2
471,KOHAKU! Manami Numakura sounds great as best girl! Also is this a  ship  I'm sensing?        bacchiri ,1
472,Sensing? I started shipping them  the moment they started interacting .,1
473,I knew this ship will happen the moment I first saw the OP,1
474,"I couldn't connect the ship routes, but I was definitely waiting for her to show up after seeing the OP the first time.",1
475,Senku x Science forever.    With Gorilla as his ntr lover.,1
476,Dammit gorilla! Stop ntr ing science,1
477,"Ah, she has a great voice. Riko from Love Lab is one of my favourites she's done.",1
478,     I like Kohaku 10 billion percent more now,1
479,"I thought that Kohaku sounded like Saber a little, was surprised when I looked it up and it wasn't Ayako Kawasumi",2
480,DAMN RIGHT IT IS!    I've been shipping it since I started reading the manga!,1
481,"I don't think Dr. Stone has a romance tag, so it'll be unofficial at the least.",2
482,The fact both Vinland and Dr Stone are getting close to perfect adaptation is a dream come true. The pulley scene was perfect.,1
483, This small excitement and relief moment of the usually calm and collected Senkuu when he finds Taiju is such a nice little touch. ,1
484,Love how Taiju just takes the insults from Senku,1
485,"This is a good example of being ""bros""",1
486,"Anime only : what the heck with the girl character desin,she looks like 2009 anime.      Manga reader : you will get used to it.",2
487,"I actually loved the designs of the girl characters, even if the male design is better  Senku just looks so cool every time I see him .",1
488,"Wait till you get to Boichi's Old Dudes, they look Badass!",1
489,"I love when the character designs are different, it really helps set it apart from the hundreds of other shows with cookie-cutter characters. This and Demon Slayer especially stand out this season.",1
490,Yeah I think people have come to expect this sorta homogenized anime aesthetic so anything a bit more stylized looks off to them.,1
491,"Yeah, it's weird because normies who aren't used to anime think  all  anime characters look weird, and  they do , we're just used to it and have acquired a taste for it. You'd think anime fans would be aware of how this works and that it's just a style, not the characters being drawn 'wrong'.",1
492,Well there's style and then there's appreciating the art which is between subjective and objective and it's slightly off. Nobody would say clannad style looks good I think.,1
493,"The style is not ""slightly off"", plenty of people have expressed that they like the design of her. Just because there is a vocal crowd against it does not make it ""objectively"" bad.",1
494,"Same, while I still don't like it yet, I really don't mind it because I know I'll love it when I get used to it. If it worked with The Promised Neverland and their mouths being so high up then I'm ten billion percent sure it'll happen here too.",1
495,     Then it sucks that this anime has only one female character design with the hair swapped out.,0
496,well kohaku and yuzuriha are pretty distinct so it gets worse later or what ?,2
497,It's kinda like Oda. every attractive girl is either a Nami or a Robin.,2
498,You're a seiba and you're a saber and everybody's a king arthur.,2
499,or an alvida,2
500,That's why demon slayer and Dr stone have been so good to me. Literally they are already in my top 5 favorites,1
501,Bleach is an expert on that front,2
502,"More like 2000 but yeah, I like it.",1
503,"Another great episode with the debut of  best gorilla. The flashback with her as a baby looks cute.    The fight between her and Tsukasa is nice.    Also farewell Taiju and Yuzuriha, enjoy being spies.",1
504,Why are some people calling her best gorilla?,1
505,I think it gets explained soon.,1
506, Now we are in the Second arc of Dr. Stone and this right here folks is where the series really shine. Now this Excites me : ,1
507,ring ring mutha fcka,1
508,"Damn, was really liking the Senku Yuzuriha Taijou relationship, hope they get back together soonish.",1
509,"Well Senkuu said it's probably going to take years, so don't expect it soon.     I can hear the joyful screams of Taiju haters in the distance.",1
510,"Wait, people hate Taiju?? Is it redditors or fans of the manga? Or he just not well liked?    It's just that I find him hilarious and he's been a constant source of entertainment every time he appears for me.",1
511,I've seen quite a few people complain about his constant shouting.,0
512,It was really annoying in the first few episodes. It got better.,1
513,"I thought it was a funny quirk of his, but that's just my opinion.",1
514,"After Asta and Zenitsu, we've had enough of this quirk. That said, Taiju never bothered me while the other two did. First I'm hearing of this.",1
515,"true, I was of them , but I got used to it , he is really hillarious tho.",1
516,"I kinda hated him in the manga, but honestly the anime has brought me around to a Taiju fan. The atmosphere voice work BGM for this anime really did him justice.",1
517,"I read somewhere that the OG protagonist was going to be Taiju, but due to decreasing sales and noting that Senku was more interesting, Boichi decided to make Senku the focus. And that saved the manga.",1
518,"Hey, Taiju said it could be days or months.        yuishrug ",2
519,That's me. :D Glad I'm done with his shouting.,1
520,Well this was the reason a lot of viewers like you were told to wait until this part.,1
521,My guess is we'll see them in a few months and Yuzuriha will be pregnant,2
522,Did you forget about episode 4?,2
523,"Yeah, it was good that he would wait until their job is done, so she has the possibility to say no. He basically didn't tell her because she couldn't say no in that situation since she relied on him to survive.  But if they are spies in the Empire of Might with Tsukasa, then she will have the opportunity to say no. And do you think after many many months they wouldn't give into their carnal desires and make love?",2
524,"He was just being a gentleman in episode 4, she's clearly into him too.",1
525,"With how Taiju is innocent, father will be Tsukasa I guess.",2
526,Why you do this?,0
527, Evil laugh in the background. ,0
528,"The more the story goes, the more I like this anime. It's hard for me not to have a look at the manga. Sure there are some things here and there that aren't that ""realistic"", but overall I just enjoy the story, the art and the animation a lot,  Senku first of all. I like smart MCs and the fact he loves science obviously speaks to me. Self-insert is working great here :     Furthermore it looks like he found a potential athletic girlfriend? If she's also somewhat smart, she'll be perfect.    About the petrification : maybe it has been done to heal someone or many people ? We'll see.",1
529,"     I hope not, because petrifying whole planet for  4k years to heal one  or even a group  of people is a complete overkill. Problem is there aren't enough clues for now, so ""aliens did it because they didn't like one person's face"" is just as good of a hypothesis.    The swallows have to have something to do with it other than being test subjects before the big thing happened. Why swallows? They aren't anything special except for their range  which of course depends on them being an African swallow or a European swallow .     And they weren't carriers for the stone plague or whatever since in the first episode there was a flash and the petrification was sudden.",0
530,Or maybe the person people responsible just hated swallows? If I could petrify every mosquito on the planet I'd go for it.,2
531,     In which case I hope it backfired in their face and their petrified remains are scattered on the bottom of a volcano or an ocean.,2
532,"It not a virus as many will recall the basically a beam of petrification coming from one direction. Or not a virus totally, a prep virus with little to no symptoms could be involved and reduces the energy cost some.",2
533,is it because they cause coconuts to migrate?  s,2
534,"Well suppose for a moment that it wasn't supposed to completely petrify someone. Like  ""the GUILT 'Triti' from the game Trauma Center - a disease intended to cure organs but instead petrifies"" ...      ...oh my god. Is this anime secretly based in the Trauma Centre universe?",2
535,"""Are you implying coconuts migrate?""",2
536,Maybe its some space thing. Some sort of radiation from a nearby star system.,2
537,Swallows because darwin maybe?,2
538,"Some people would sacrifice a part of the planet for their beloved one. We could also think about an accident while trying to find a method to heal someone from an illness. I won't say I'm convinced myself about this theory, to be honest. So far, some mad scientist wanting to make a reset with humanity in order to save the planet because of pollution and global warming looks like the most plausible but I can't say it will be this explanation in the end either.",2
539,"The OP somehow reminds me of  of Bleach's Tonight, Tonight, Tonight OP. Like when the music lead up to the chorus hits, the glorious engrish ""Tonight, love is rationed! Tonight across the nation..."" is what I'm humming.",1
540,"""The surface was too deteriorated to revert to living cells!"" given the thickness of that surface, Senku should've revived not only skinless but also missing the outer veins   muscle fibers etc.  And with Taiju's mouth being open...    So Senku realized that the energy to keep on thinking had to come from somewhere.  But why is he not curious about how a stone brain can do any thinking in the first place?    Senku is damn lucky he missed Tsukasa when running down the mountain towards the noise.    Anyway, best girl Kohaku is finally here!",1
541,     You just forgot that the depetrification mechanic heal up from anything...,2
542,"     If it healed that much, Senku wouldn't have gotten corpses when he clumsily put together the shattered statues.  We're talking like a centimeter's width of missing flesh all around.",2
543,     Because he wasn't dexterous enough to accurately put the pieces together that's seems like that what he was talking about to Yuzuriha and guess what is her super over-the-top ability ?...         Those get automatically restored by the depetrification process I guess,2
544,This was heck of a long intro. They should've made it first time to show an OP.    No swallows were hurt during the series.,1
545,So there have been more generations of hobos before Senkuu waking up?        Oh those hobos are gonna freak out when Senkuu starts making modern shit,2
546,They're gonna lose their shit when he makes a steam engine.,1
547,I wonder how many people woke up and just died because they had no idea how to hunt or what plants to eat.,2
548,Well the lack of Taiju and Yuzuriha in the visual that came out earlier in the week makes more sense now,1
549,visual? would you mind giving e the link please?,2
550,Proper story and animation will make an anime good.    But I believe the soundtracks are what pushes an anime from good to great. The sound for this anime is really good,1
551,"Get ready, this is when Dr.stone really begins!",1
552,"I don't care what anyone says, Senkaiju is the OTP. They are the Adam and Eve of the stonu wardo.",1
553,I get the feeling Senku just told Yuzuriha to glue every broken person in the world back together.,2
554,That's gonna be a lot of penis gluing,2
555,"If this were  r Animemes doing it, there would be a lot of penises incorrectly glued to women.",2
556,And penises glued to the nose so they'd all look like Squidward        azusalaugh ,1
557,And if they're missing a few fingers and toes she could replace those with penises as well,2
558, ,2
559,"That my guess, he figured out that his trys might have failed because he did not connect the parts together well enough.",0
560,"That’s where I thought they were going too, but I don’t see how being spies on Tsukasa helps with that.",2
561,"Well, Tsukasa wants to break all the adults, so maybe he wants her to pick up all the pieces in his path, as it were.",2
562,"Kohaku is so cute, and hell yes! I can ship her with Senkuu.    More importantly, Tsukasa made it sound like Kohaku was born in this world!?! Does that mean some people never became stone and were alive during these 3,700 years?! Or perhaps someone awakened roughly around 17 years ago and then had a child?    LIKE HOLY HELL THIS IS HUGE NEWS! I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER!    The beginning of this episode was dope with Senkuu and Taiju saying the same things and Senkuu using blood to write E=MC 2.    Also, I had been saying it would be perfect for Senkuu to get a love interest who was either a science freak or oblivious to science and didn't believe it. It sounds like Kohaku may be the 2nd one which is awesome!",1
563,I think it's more likely that some people may have un-petrified sooner than Senku and had children. Maybe even a pregnant woman un-petrified.,2
564,"Even so, I doubt you'd be back to believing in vengeful mountain spirits so quickly. The modern-day mom would have smacked her daughter for believing such stuff.    I think it's atleast 200 years, probably several, since these people arose.",2
565,but what if the parents believed in them already?,2
566,Agree! Hopefully they tell us soon. I hate waiting for cliffhangers like that!,1
567,"You're going to be waiting probably to the end of the season, depending on how fast they go, but the explanation payoff is one of my favorites in the 25 years I've been watching anime reading manga.",1
568,"With the 3chapter episode pace we are going to get there by Ep 15-16. But I agree with you, that whole mini-arc was just amazing. Not to mention the second to latest manga chapter...",1
569,She has modern nudity taboo otherwise she be wearing only a loin cloth or nothing at all so you know parents were modern.,2
570,"not necessarily. It could have been several generations, culture of wearing clothes could pass from generation to generation.",2
571,Edit I drew my conclusion to fast. I remember the men being shirtless but only at the start it seams although I did not check all the recordings. If the men are wearing tops it is actually to chilly so both sexes would wear a top and on the encounter the men are in shirts so I jumped to fast.     Following will only apply if the guys take off their shirts and she does not modify her garment accordingly but I assume we will know her status before then.     Following is based on my thinking the guys had their shirts off for unknown reason.  But why would that uncomfortable resource using habit develop? Topless for both sexes sort of the rule when it's warm enough for men to want to go shirtless the women do to in primitive cultures. A tribe in Japan's climate would wear shirts and then heaver as the seasons changed. Nudity taboos seam to develop with civilizations with strong indications it part of the reaction to Sexually Transmitted Deseases being able to take hold once population got high enough. There is a lot more but I've seen clothing worn by primitive tribes world wide and without a civilization or a civilization's religion involved if the men go topless the women do too. Full nudity is most often only found in really hot and humid places. Although everyone swam nude and normally together anyway. Japan actually had very little nudity taboo till the West forced them to have one.,2
572,"you are thinking of primitive societies that grew and developed over time, and through evolution. People that had to start from nothing and advance through the ages.      But we are dealing with people that are already descended from modern humans. Modern humans already have vast knowledge about a whole bunch of things, and have complex societal structures and culture. For all we know these modern humans educated their children, taught them the customs of society, language, naming  her name is a Japanese name , etc. Sure generation after generation you will start to lose some of this, but I don't find it hard to believe that clothing and language stuck around. As both of those are useful things to have, and not that hard to keep up.",2
573,"Once language came up from someone else the discussion of clothing became mute because she spoke modern Japanese meaning she was a dependent of modern person who woke up fairly recently. After 3000 years extremely likely the language is quite different if they are knocked back to stone tools. Even with modern technology the languages are very likely to have changed a vast amount. It the constant human tendency to create slang that modifies things. Modern Greeks form what I have heard can sort of make out some of Ancient Greek but have to take classes to get more of it.     My clothing comments were based on a people avoided petrification but lacked the skills to maintain civilization idea and addressed to those proposing that. But I had not noticed the guys always wearing shirts so my clothing comment was off, if the guys in shirts than the girls will be in shirts. It is clearly cooler than the environment makes it look like to me.   But if they fell back to stone tools level from assuming people who avoided petrification then most likely especially with a Japanese background at least more traditional Japanese clothing values come into play were both sexes when hot and working would go topless and mixed sex baths and no reluctance to be nude when needed existed. But again this subject error on my part I sort of thought the guys work at least taking shirts off to work at times but they were not so if the guys have shirts on then women probably would wear them as well.",2
574,The KoSenku ship is sailing! All aboard the best ship!,1
575,I bet that some miners wefe underground and escaped the petrification.,1

578, Der mensch ist böse. Der Mensch muss besser und böser werden. ,2
579,LOL the plan worked perfectly and the Ubermensch civilization covers central Europe but they did not want to over populate and turned inward to contemplation. ;     All Racist superiority jokes from me is inspired by Mel Brooks in that ridicule is what the Racists deserve so yes laugh at them.,1
580,So that's it huh? We're some kind of Dr. Stone?,2
581,"Well boys, that's it. Pack up",1
582,So.     I was wrong two episodes ago in wanting to drop this and the guys telling me to watch two more were right.    Thank you. : ,1
583,"I'm so glad to hear this. As many have already said, the prologue arc is by FAR the weakest segment of the series. But if you get past that, the reward is SO worth it. I think you'll enjoy what's coming next a lot.",1
584,Yeah this show is like all of the exact combinations of things i love mixed up together and it has trebuched its way right to the top of my list.,1
585,"Yup this episode confirms it, if it hadn't already, I'm never gonna like Tsukasa, he's clearly a villain, who in only a few episodes has already made himself pretty irredeemable. I can understand why people like characters like him, and Garou, but I'm never gonna be able to force myself in that direction.",1
586,He has a very believable motivation in that might makes right and his own experiences with corrupt authority has colorex his view in that only pure people under his rule can prosper. Understanding him does not mean liking him.,1
587,"For now one could interpret that his only goal is to get people on their formative years so he could shape a new culture, since these people aren't ingrained with old social constructs. It's a nice way to fix the world's problems, an opportunity that is really hard to come by.  Of course, from the way he acted this episode, he might not have this sort of mindset. But his backstory and speeches were all drawing this sort of critique and plan.",1
588,Yeah. His plan is incredibly flawed but the logic behind it seems rational enough. The only way I see this going is a Lord of the Flies scenario.,1
589,"I wasn't sure if I would continue watching. But this episode turned me around, I look forward to what comes next.",1
590,"I really like that Kohaku's immediate reaction to Tsukasa was ""I don't know what your reasons are and I don't care because what I saw you do was so underhanded that I'm gonna put a stop to you anyway.""",1
591,"I really like the passing of time of Senku making a pulley, although he mentioned it the manga seeing it here in the the anime the encounter of Kohaku & Senku is around afternoon and finishing the pulley at sunset is really satisfying. The Ending song is literally the icing on the cake",1
592,OHAYO SEKAI,2
593,GOO MORNING WARULD,2
594,I can hear this comment and I giggled like a school girl. Take my upvote,1
595,Kohaku is already a good waifu,1
596,“It’s called a pulley!”,2
597,"Ooh, I hope we actually do get an answer to who or what caused the petrification.    I don't want it to be like The Walking Dead where the writers dangle the mystery in front of viewers' faces and then go ""nah, it's actually not relevant"".",1
598,"No spoilers, but it's still the main plot of the manga, so you don't have to worry about that.",1
599,no concrete answers yet but we've had hints about it in the manga. Not sure we'll see many of them animated though.,1
600,"I think the title is a big hint: it's some medicine experiment that went haywire would be my guess. This last ep proved Dr. Stone refers to not only soap but also the healing properties of the petrification stone.     However, I hope it's never actually revealed. A reveal would be proper in a full fantasy show, but this show is atleast  somewhat  grounded in science. There is no possibility they can explain satisfactory by science, even pseudo-science, stone magic that hit all people in the world simultaneously. It's magic or insane future-tech  from aliens, because this is the present-day and not the far future  alright. It's not really important to have an explanation.",2
601," If  the explanation is not important then I wish the show doesn't spend time addressing the mystery, to put it bluntly",1
602,"We're officially reaching the parts us manga readers keep screaming over.    You guys, get excited this is gonna be an amazing ride. Dr. Stone gets even more amazing from here on out!",1
603,"I can't wait for next episode , most of my fav characters will be introduced.",1
604,Saaaaame. Can't wait to see them animated and hear their voices!,1
605,"I like that her eyes are far apart. Makes her look unique.    Why did Tsukasa mention that she has blue eyes? What's the significance there? Are they not all Japanese?    ""She"" is Kohaku.    I hope we're done with flashbacks for a while. They take up a lot of the episode and don't really add much.",1
606,"     Blue eyes is a very rare trait in the Far-East, especially with blonde hair.",2
607,And from another Anime I learned blue eyes in Japanese normally comes with blindness.,2
608,"Fun fact, every blue eyed person on Earth has a single common ancestor from 10k-6K years ago. His name  may  have been ""Steve.       but   probably   wasn't.",2
609,"Whoa now, Captain America didn't go THAT far back in time.",1
610,"Nah definitely not, in anime it's usually depicted as light grey eyes.",2
611,"To establish that it's a unique trait in-universe.        The thing is, while blue eyes are so rare in the far east as to be nigh-impossible to find  punnett's square has no mercy, alas , anime almost never plays itself that close to reality.  Thanks to 'mukokuseki', an attempt to make anime characters feel universal, like they belong everywhere and nowhere in the real world, an anime character, even if they're full-blooded japanese, could very well have bright purple hair and electric yellow eyes.  Anime fans are so used to this trait of anime that if they saw a character with a japanese name and blue eyes, they wouldn't assume there was anything special about their eye color.        By having Tsukasa point out her blue eyes, the story is establishing that mukokuseki isn't in play... at least, where her eyes are concerned... I guess Senku's onion hair is fine... anyway, it's a way of letting the audience know that her having blue eyes is supposed to allude to a mystery surrounding Kohaku and her people, and not just be a design choice with no narrative implications.",2
612,"It’s been a lot of time, there’s a variety of ways non-Japanese people could’ve ended up there, petrified or not.",2
613,Another Saber hmmmm,2
614,umu,1
615,"I would love for them to reveal that she is a true Saberface, and MHX lands to slay her.",1
616,"Senku is too smart    And thus, Dr. Stone was born    Also, if that girl were one of their children, how would she be that young?? It's been thousands of years",1
617,"I think the point is that someone woke up before Senku did, and she's the child of those people.",2
618,"Yeah, Tsukasa talks about it being 2nd or 3rd generation. Then about the danger of a primitive group being around.",2
619,"and instead of teaching their kids science, those people taught them about sorcery.",2
620,Parent did not pay attention in school was into the occult. ; ,2
621,or just watched a lot of anime           ,2
622,"I'm thinking grandchild, it could be past that but you can't go more than several generations, you'd run into communication problems.",2
623,Read the manga and all is revealed : ,1
624,"It's pretty ironic that Tsukasa's all like ""primitives aren't dangerous at all"" when all he wants is to make everyone live primitively.",1
625,They’re not dangerous to him specifically because he’s op. Granted still a faulty line of reason when he doesn’t know their numbers,2
626,This and he will grow old and weak one day       If he is planning on leading a dictatorship he would be better off telling everyone he is a god and to not touch him,2
627,"It's less that he's never going to worry about them, and more that he doesn't view them as an  immediate  threat. His goal 1 is to defend the cave from Taiju, goal 2 is to repopulate based on his own philosophies, after that is going well. . .",2
628,     But without something clearly magic  other than his ridiculous strength  what does he have to convince people he's a god? Whereas Kohaku already thinks Senku is a Sorcerer because of Gun powder.,2
629,"Mhm, I mean humans managed that feat a few thousand years ago too. Thinking of  ancient Egypt. I think beating up their leader or strongest warrior like childs play and then telling them he is a god could suffice.        And at least he could make gunpowder and impress them with that",2
630,"Well he doesn’t want to live with dangerous people such as Senku that would use modern tools against him, so it seems logical",1
631,I like how he said there's no reason to attack them and then immediately proceeds to down a huge tree that very likely would've killed the blonde if not for her sheer luck.,0
632,The idea of primitive people is interesting. Great ending to the episode too.    Though the progress feels pretty slow so far.,1
633,If only the natives were fluffy like the ones in utawarerumono,1
634,Senku flexed his knowledge and got a waifu xD,1
635,"So uh, is it explained later why the primitive people also speak Japanese?",2
636,yes,1
637,Not sure why but I'm really digging the female character designs. They seem unique for modern designs.,1
638,"It's a throwback, and I love it",1
639,"I never said it was a spoiler but as someone else replied to you that is something only mange readers understand, if you want to make references or talk about the manga you are free to do it in the source corner.",1
640,"It wasn't his comment though. The smiley just showed the same facial expression a certain character sometimes does in the manga. So I meant how only manga readers will know what the smiley means. It doesn't spoil anything at all, it's just a facial expression.    It wasn't directed at his comment.",1
641,"Hmm, fair enough. Sadly the user seem to also have deleted his comment so I can not reapprove it.",2
642,Wow what happend here? What did you say?,2
643,"Finally the cliffhanger is over. Meanwhile I've already binged half the manga    The irony that this show is about science, meanwhile Kohaku's skirt defies the laws of phsyics",1
644,"He's like ""awesome she's like tajiu, but we can have babies"" lol",1
645,The way he did was amazing but couldn't he have just excavated the ground around her?,2
646,It's solid rock around her,2
647,"What? I really thought it was earth. I mean, the groove around her was in the perfect shape for her. If it was rock she was insanely lucky or Tsukasa insanely skilled.",2
648,Latter,2
649,My second favorite girl has finally entered the scene.,1
650,Kohaku is officialy the first memeber of Dr.Senku Stone Age chicks Harem,1
651,Im gonna jump in the mangas dick so fast right now. I did not know that this show was gonna be this good,1
652,"Really interesting to have a Stone World character. Knowing that there is at least one family out there, that was revived before Senku makes the series a   LOT   more interesting.",1
653,"I didn't understand Senku's logic for the stone only covering the body but being totally stone when it breaks. Is he saying that only people that stayed conscious can be revived since it consumes the stone to just a layer ? or it just takes more time to revive ?    Also why did Tsukasa used a tree to trap the girl ? if he wanted to stop her why not just bind her or something, or if he wanted to kill her why not just do that ?",2
654,"People are totally stone when they are petrified. When they break out, only the outer layer remains stone. This is because the outer layer has deteriorated, so it can no longer change back.    As for Tsukasa, I suppose he didn't want to kill her because of that whole pure without science thing he had going on, and he couldn't bother or take the time to bind her when he had to immediately get back to the cave to get the miracle water.",2
655,"That makes sense thanks, also the outer layer unable to change but not doing harm may be a signal of intelligent design.",1
656,"If Dr Stone goes the way of divine intervention, I'll be pretty mad.",0
657,"Lol, sorry, i said it in the sense of someone actually engineering it",1
658,Am I the only one who thinks that if episode 5 and 6 were combined it would've made a great moment even better.    aka this particular section is probably more suited to binging IMO because the without the week break in between the emotional moment at the start wouldve hit just that much harder.,1
659,"Yes, I started the manga at around the time this part was published so reading the whole 'prologue' in one sitting made it much, much better.",1
660,"Yeah, but combining episodes doesn't happen very often, especially in the middle. Only ones I remember was the ending of Made in Abyss and start of Re:Zero, were there any others?",1
661,idk of any other then that tbh but instead we can settle for now binging the episodes together instead of waiting a week.,1
662,"Well I thought that blonde girl somehow revived her self just like Senkuu but it seems people have been living throughout those 3,700 years. Senkuu tells Taiju not to be loud and he almost immediately does that. The fight at the end was not bad, to bad Tsukasa is so much stronger.",1
663,     What ?,2
664,I thought the girl Kohaku brought herself back in a similar manner to how Senkuu did. I did not think humanity continued after that wave of Petrifaction.,2
665,My theory for the the reason petrification happened is that some advanced alien race saw that Earth wasn't going to last much longer if humans kept up their bullshit so they froze them for a few thousand years to let the planet cool off.,2
666,Senku and his Stone age Saber waifu,2
667,This show is so dope,2
668,"Can someone explain to me how Senku came back?    He tricked Tsukasa to aim at his neck where he had stone there but I didn't quite understand,    1  How it didn't break his neck?  You can break stones like the broken arm and that's it     2  When using nitric acid it fixes the organs? So how come it can't fix the broken arm?",2
669,"1. Tsukasa broke his neck, but the stone was hidden in the little piece of hair just above the neck  and the stone heals a small area which included the neck     2. Honestly, I think it's better if you leave this point as it is as we're going into a future plot point spoiler if I explain it",2
670,Damn. Kohaku is hotter than I thought she would be        uwaa ,1
671,"Great episode but I was confused about Senku's hypothesis about the petrification in the beginning: ""It's the other way around! The surface was too deteriorated to revert to living cells!""    I feel so stupid. Can someone help me out? What conclusion was Senku coming to in these sequence?",1
672,"What he means by that is the de-petrification didn't happen from the inside out  like hatching from an egg  but the other way around. Basically the stone itself turned into the cells that make up the human body, however any piece of the stone that was too deteriorated  destroyed  couldn't turn into cells and so it stayed as a shell and crumbled.    This would also explain how their insides weren't filled with rocks when they got revived given that broken statues were rock even on the inside, the stone inside simple changed to cells instead of breaking down since it was preserved.    Edit: and the overall conclusion he got from this is that it wasn't something in his body that made him break out, but an external influence from somewhere nearby, the cells part I explained plays part in how he got resurrected after being killed  the depetrification healing cells in the area that's still a stone ",2
673,"Watching the dub which is why this comment is 2 weeks late, but I just wanted to piggy back off this comment since it's the closest one on the point I want to make that I could find  and I'd also like to hear your thoughts on the matter     So my roommate and I are watching the show together and thought about Yuzuriha's idea last week: what if we could somehow put everyone back together and  then  used the revival fluid? Shouldn't they come back to life then  especially with the depetrification process's healing properties ? Senku just tells her that he tried that already and it turns them into messed up corpses and doesn't know why that's the case. Honestly, I'm  super  curious about this  we were even thinking of maybe bringing broken statutes to like an active volcano or something to help reseal the broken parts. But I honestly really hope that they don't just give up on this idea and figure out a reason why. Mainly cuz, it'd be the best way to combat Tsukasa's genocide right now imo.",1
674,"Dude, did you see the breast physics? How is that not a miracle?",1
675,No bras in the stone world to keep them in place,2
676,"Have to rewatch. Young Women's breasts for most of them move a lot less than you would think especially if they don't wear bras and doubly for East Asians who's breasts often stay mostly fibrous into fourties and beyond making early cancer x-rays difficult. Other women breasts convert to fat in 20's or before.   I'm a late period Baby Boomer, 1962, I remember the wonderful no bra days, especially at amusement parks in Florida in the summer heat and even D cups don't move anywhere as much as you think they do.   It pregnancy or significant weight changes that sag them and make them bounce all over the skin tightness lost.     Look for Young Nudist videos if your in place like US were that still legal if you don't believe.",1
677,There are literally 0 spoilers in my post though. Everything was stated in the episode.,1
678,"Yeah, they did the same thing to me on the Arifureta threat when I just stated that ""X thing in the show, that looks like an X thing from real life is indeed based on that thing, he even says so in the LN.""     It is ridiculous.     Please repost it on the source material corner, so others can see it.",1
679,Welcome to r anime mods. Alienating half their audience just to handhold the other half.,0
680,"Spoilers also need to be tagged in the source corner, if you see untagged improperly tagged spoilers there please report.",2
681,Care to point out what spoilers exactly did I have in my comment? Because I couldn't find a single one.,1
682,"The one you tagged for one.    Other than that there may not be spoilers but your comment was removed because any talk about the source material, no matter if they are spoilers or not belongs in the source corner, how is that so difficult to understand?",1
683,"How is no one talking about the fact that a young woman survived a tree falling directly on top of her with no bone or organ damage? I went back and watched all of the scenes prior, and she's standing on completely flat ground the entire time. That divot she's in was not there before the tree fell, which means it's supposed to be the dent that her body made as the tree smashed her into solid rock. What the actual fuck is going on here? I thought this show was supposed to be the super duper science and logic show? I mean I get they take their liberties here and there, but if she doesn't have superpowers, then that whole scene is just fucking stupid.",0
684,That's what I've been saying about Tsukasa the whole time - he's closer to Hercules than Louis Cyr.,1
685,"I can handle some ridiculousness, like okay, he’s crazy strong, it’s a shipment, whatever, but she’s a super feminine young girl, and that’s a fucking oak tree. Sorry, but that’s just not happening.",0
686,Didn't fall directly on here she was in a sort of dig...,0
687,"Can you please read my original post before commenting? Go back through the last 60 seconds before the tree falls. There’s a shot of them standing with locked weapons and they’re both on flat ground, and there’s a shot of her getting knocked down, again onto flat ground. What is with people on this site and not reading? I literally already mentioned that. The divot was not already there. Please stop wasting everyone’s time.",0
688,The fact that the divot was not there was animation error.,2
689,"You have a source on that? That’s a nice excuse, but how was it not there in two different shots? They just “forgot” to draw it in both the side shot of both of them and the shot of her falling to the ground, but suddenly remembered for the one where she’s under the tree? That’s a pretty massive error, because it completely alters what happens on screen from “thank god this divot was here so she didn’t instantly die” to “wow, she’s so strong that a tree falling on her smashed a dent into the ground beneath her!”",0
690,"Manga pages  1     There was no flat surface landing panel in the manga, and the entire era is filled with divots, compared to the anime where it's only a shallow one in the middle where she landed. Assuming that she did not move, her body could not have caused that massive crack to appear, so it's a simple animation error.",0
691,"Well that’s at least slightly better than if they had done it on purpose. The manga version makes way more sense because you don’t actually see the ground until she’s already on the floor, but the anime shows you two different shots of the floor with no divots in it.    Thanks for the info. I’m still surprised more people didn’t notice though. Is everyone here just a manga reader as well?",1
692,"Eh, to be honest, it's a rather small detail error, because the flat surface landing was only there for like 3 frames, and they spent a lot of time showing her in a long crack after that. Animation errors like this are bound to happen  even with some of the most famous anime .",1
693,"It’s not small though because it changes the meaning of the entire scene. That K-On shot just looks awful, but it’s obvious that it’s not trying to say that she has a deformed arm.     This isn’t an issue of a badly drawn frame, it’s an issue of a frame that is simply completely different from what it’s supposed to be, and as I said previously, implies that the divot that appears  after  the tree falls  and is very close to the actual shape of her body  was caused  by  the tree hitting her into the ground. That’s not realistic at all and is not actually what was supposed to be portrayed in the first place, so I’d say that’s actually a major error. As a visual medium, a large part of the communication of the story takes place in the actual artwork and animation, and the animation on screen completely changed what happened in the manga AND it suggested an event that lowers the quality of the show because such an event really doesn’t make any sense. How is that not important?",0
694,"Did the people in charge of drawing Kohaku worked in Clannad Air Kanon?    The eyes separation is too big in some scenes.     Original.      Quick, crappy fix by me.       There is no need to make the eyes so separated.    Other than that it was a great episode, it implies not everyone got petrified and Kohaku saying she feels attracted to Senku would create funny situations.",0
695,"I don't see what the big deal is, it looks fine to me.    ",1
696,oh no,0
697,I think the general way the eyes are drawn are the issue. Moving them closer together still makes them feel a little uncanny.,1
698,"I do genuinely love Bochi's artwork, but his eyes can be very weird at times.",1
699,"I dig the way he draws the male but suddenly when it come to female, they turn into ""ugu am i cute"". Zero idea how did he fuck this up.    I mean, look at Tsukasa or Senku. So bad ass and almost perfectly drawn anatomy. Sharp looking, gazing eyes of absolute anime chads. But when it comes to females', they become stars. Not because they sparkles like stars, but because they are so far apart from one another.",0
700,"Well he did go through a shitton of yaoi manga for male anatomy research, so...",1
701,"Don't boo him, he's right",1
702,It's the nose placement. Your nose ridge goes up to the bottom of your forehead.,2
703,"Kohaku appeared! Seems a little shortsighted to say ""I didn't hear your conversation but I'm sure you were in the wrong."" I wasn't really sure what her voice would sound like since I'm not super familiar with the VA's voice, but I thought she sounded pretty good. Her character design didn't seem quite as bug-eyed as she is in the manga either.",1
704,"I mean, I don't think she needed more information: Saw a guy put a spear to a pretty innocent girl and possibly killed a guy. Even with the context, she probably would've fought the guy.",2
705,"  Pretty much this right here. If you see someone being violent, taking hostages and murdering people...honestly, you're not going to care about the whys. You're just going to want justice.",2
706,"Her voice actress is Manami Numakura who voiced Tsubame from UzaMaid, but I found her when I came to know she got cast as the VA for backpack cart Titan in AoT. She has amazing range and is great.",1
707,"To add to that, she also voices Narberal Gamma from Overlord. So I guess it somehow fits that her characters  both Nabe and Kohaku  seem to be  cute at first appearance but could be deadly  at any moment.",1
708,"Her eyesight is irrelevant here. And yes I'm aware, I've read the manga.",1

711,Like Stone age fatestay-saber clannad,1
712,"Alrighty, now Senku has a waifu of his own",1
713,So did my boy just discover a baddie that likes him?,2
714,Does anyone have a stitch of Senku & his robot army fighting Tsukasa & his primitive one?,2
715,"Last episode we get to see how Senku and his Science inspire people to be better, and in some cases even use Science to help those around them. It's a great ""fuck yeah, humanity"" story and I can never get enough of it.     Even if everyone has some cheat-level skill I love love love the accurate science and crazy characters. I can't wait to see Anime-Onlies reaction to Senku's first ""Road Map"", as well as the rest of the Village People and  ""Gen with his Cheat-Level Charisma"" ",1
716,The OP started so late I was afraid it was the ED.,2
717,Get ready for the real start of Dr Stone. Battle of the two kingdoms.,1
718, Senku’s expression      A genuine smile from senku??     I love that they integrated the final scenes with the outro. This episode was really good. I’m a bit sad that they spilt up. I was hoping to see the 3 of working them together.     Some of my favourite backgrounds from this episode.     Mountain bg      Senku holding the flag      Forest bg ,1
719,Kohaku reminded me of Ayla from Crono Trigger️️️,1
720,love the warning at the end. basing every solution on real life practicality is awesome,1
721,"That's what makes the manga really shine. Sort of ""rediscovering"" all these little aspects of science that makes our lives the way it is, and building it from scratch.",1
722,"""Senku should just petition the show to be renamed to ""How to pick up girls in a stone world"" lol",1
723,"The beginning of this episode was a prime example of what I've been saying since the start - there are so many illogical things throughout - but then the show tries to be very logical in explaining how things work and the science behind it. It really works against your suspension of disbelief but at least it's funny. The new game plan seems interesting although, Tsukasa is just too strong and seemingly a step ahead - I wonder how long it will take him to find put that Taiju and Yuzuriha are spies?",1
724,Would you mind elaborating on what you find illogical about the start of the episode?,2
725," I think it was a logical leap to go from ""deterioration isn't the cause of the revival"" to ""there must be something in that cave"".",2
726,"Can't agree with that. He figures out deterioration isn't the cause of the revival and then also that there are pieces of the stone layer missing, so something has to have acted upon those areas from the outside, at which point a bat flies past him, over the place where his body was. So it's not far fetched that he probably suspected it might have something to do with that. That maybe the bats, while flying in and out all the time, either got something on them from within the cave or carried something from the outside into cave that caused this effect, so it makes sense to check the cave.    Might be a bit much, but he is supposed to be really smart and in a situation where it was established that he would try everything. You could even forget the whole part above and imagine he was like ""Oh hey, a cave. I was never in that cave. Might as well look what's inside the cave."" and it would work out.",1
727,"Also, it's not like he had many leads to investigate. He went to the cave following a hunch  even if it was somewhat backed by his deductive reasoning  and gained empirical proof of his theory. After that he just had to experiment until he got it right.",1
728,"It wasn't a hunch, he saw a bunch of unpetrified swallows flying out of the cave",2
729,     Bats ,2
730,"Eh no, it was a bat.",2
731,"The other thing he's forgetting is that this happened over many months, we just got it in a couple of minutes for time's sake because it's a show lol...",1
732,"Yeah, the show seems pretty bad at showcasing how much timw actually passes.",0
733,"We were told in like the first episode when Taiju woke up, but yeah it might have been good to remind us.",1
734,Told. Not shown.,2
735,"Told then, shown now...in today's episode.",2
736,"I wish this had been his reaction: ""the cave is all I have to go on so it might be worth a look"". If identifying the cave wasn't a logical leap, then the leap is in his level of certainty that the cave must be the cause. Any scientist knows about extraneous variables.      That said, my previous worry was more troubling and has been reduced to a smaller gripe, so point taken.",1
737,"The two illogical aspects of this show are:    1. The petrification thing. It's pure sci-fi, and you just have to roll with that one. If you can buy the Epstein Drive or F2L spaceflight, that shouldn't be too hard.     2. Everyone's a bit extra, a bit too good at one thing. They're all min-maxers, but within the realms of possibility.     Other than that, they try to use accurate science.",0
738,Great episode,1
739,"IT BEGIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES. Didn't think I'd see this animated so soon, I'm so hyped for who is casting the characters, I always had these voices in my head for them but I wanna see what they do.",1
740,The female faces seem off. Like a low budget hentai,0
741,"I could be wrong, but I think that’s meant to be the difference of generations like Tsukasa said. I mean, obviously we have no clue how long those generations have been going, or how many came before them. I assume we learn more about it in the next episode, considering the title.",1
742,"Yuzuriha also looks like the star of a budget hentai, though.",0
743,People out here spoiling future characters and I thought I was bad.,0
744,Did the new chick  look a little funny  to anyone else,0
745,Why did Senku not tell them about his stone neck? What if they never noticed? And what if that other guy just bashed his head in instead of hitting his neck? A lot of convenient plot points.,2
746,Then the story would have ended early and it wouldn't have been as interesting.,0
747,"Well yeah, I agree but the writing is not that sensible.",1
748,"Because breaking that part of neck is sure, clean and painless way to kill. Bashing or cutting his head would either not kill him instantly or would be too messy and brutal way to kill his maybe-a-friend-in-the-past. It is not like it was Senku's number one plan to get killed there, they just made the gunpowder to not do that.",2
749,He also highly respected Senku and didn't want him to suffer because of that.,1
750," Senkus ""not in one million percent"" ""10 billion points for you"" ""not even a milimeter of interest"" is kinda getting old    not saying that its a bad thing or anything",1
751,We could only look at Senku's back so no.,2
752,"God this show gets intense. I wonder what the girl's story is. She speaks fluent Japanese, so she couldn't be descended too far from the originals. My guess is that her mother was pregnant, got petrified, and because of the energy consumption of two people in one stone body  and maybe the mother was determined to let her child live, holding on like Taiju , broke free sooner. And taught the child as muchas she could before dying.    Or maybe at least two people were freed and had  a child, but that feels less likely.    Can't wait for next week!",1
753,"I doubt she was freed from the stone. As far as I can tell, she doesn't have any flesh cracks, while the four people we know have been freed have them across their bodies. Yuzuriha's are less obvious, but she does have a spiral crack on her collarbone.",1
754,And on her shoulder.,1
755,"I was talking more about her being an unborn baby in her mother's womb when the petrification happened. The mother would have cracks, but the baby, once born, most likely wouldn't.",1
756,In that case it would make more sense that she was stone free.,1
757,     Don't overthink that one.,1
758,Can't wait for best boy debut next week,1
759,I still find this anime to be just ok. I’m going to keep watching though and see where it goes. It seems like things are going to start picking up with this new plot twist and I heard the manga is apparently really good. I know its obviously still early but I’m not that interested in any of the characters yet so I’m hoping they develop some more depth...although the stunt that Senku pulled at the end to move the tree was pretty cool.,1
760,"If you liked that, then you'll probably enjoy the next arcs. It's also when they introduce the true cast.",1
761,"Well, it is a part of the true cast, just not in the first arc",1
762,Definitely keep watching. You just finished the prologue. Now it gets really good.,1
763," A new girl enters the fray           tanakalove       So him and George were right next to each other.      Aliens, Super weapons, or super virus.  Not bad choices.      So he figured it out by backtracking things about the bats, now he just needs to know what else helped.       So the petrafication on his neck did save him, nice.      Damn George and Moe chan are so happy Senku lived.      A nice hide flag scarf?      Senku asking the big questions finally.  Who did it and why.      George and Moe-chan infiltrate Tarzan's team?

Jane what are you trying to do here?  Oh she saw Tarzan try to hurt Moe-chan and kill Senku and wants to stop Tarzan.      Tarzan thinks she was born in this world?  Hmm... i guess i didnt consider that.  I figured everyone would be the ones saved from Petrafication.  I didnt think that people could have gotten out many years ago, had kids and a few generations of primals.      Oh shit he dropped a tree on her, hes too rough.      Senku is here too, wait isnt Tarzan around too then?  Isnt this risky?      Wow hes making bombs to save her?  Wait... NO! PULLYS! OH SHIT!  SCIENCE!      Kohaku?  Shes in love?

766,What shall you do now monkey man?! I have a pully monkey man!,2
767,"Overall a great episode. Here are my thoughts     ;    1. A bit of a logical leap to go from deterioration isn't the cause of the revival to there must be something in that cave.   2. I don't know about the two competing nations turn this show went in. I hope the antagonist and protagonist continue to interact, instead of there just being a big showdown.   3. Female faces are drawn weird af",1
768,"To address your first thought: Senku's observation was that deterioration wasn't the cause, there had to be some external factor. He noted that the revival appeared to begin from his head down. At that point, the bat flew by. What this did was draw his attention to the cave, which was in the direction his head was lying. So Senku's logic here is, ""The external factor is closest to my head, my head is the closest part of me to that cave, there may be something in the cave worth investigating.""",1
769," I wish this had been his reaction: ""the cave is all I have to go on so it might be worth a look"". If identifying the cave wasn't a logical leap, then the leap is in his level of certainty that the cave must be the cause. Any scientist knows about extraneous variables.    That said, my previous worry was more troubling and has been reduced to a smaller gripe, so point taken.",1
770,"Can't say anything about 2 and 1 was already answered so for 3...    I mostly agree, but from what the manga users says and as a Promised Neverland viewer, you'll get used to it, and  possibly  eventually love it due to the uniqueness.",1
771,"Well the promised neverland was less jarring, but point taken.",1
772,Aw hell yeah Kohaku is here. Pretty excited now.,1
773,"Ohh, watched this op for the first time and just noticed it got some haikyuu vibes. Haha.",1
774,that waking up Senku scene gave me chills,1
775,"Good news for you anime only that get bothered by the girl design, that girl will not appear with that eye everytime she on the screen, for someone that read sun Ken rock you guys actually know that boichi art is not consistent but in a good way. Kohaku's eyes will keep changing every time she appear, I know it is so confusing,you guys maybe think what's good about that, for someone that read the manga I actually think the same as you guys at first but how boichi's art keep changing I actually get used to it.",1
776,"Gee, I wonder how long it will be before Yuzu and Taiju are back",1
777,I'm pretty excited for what comes next. I can't wait for the scientific army to crush the Tsukasa clan,1
778,"Ah damn, already sensed the neckbeards salivating as soon as I saw Kohaku lmao",1
779,I found my dream waifu <3,1
780,I wish there were more science moments like the ending scene and not half episode flashbacks.,1
781,"As far as I understand from that last episode  maybe I'm wrong, we'll see in the future  the new character  Kohaku  is born generations after Senku and the others.  And yet, they speak the same language.  Isn't this a little strange?    It leaves me thinking that maybe everyone were petrified but Senku wasn't the one to break free. Maybe.    If that's it, I can't wait to see an alter ego to Senku in a ""stone"" society meeting the MC  I suppose that she isn't alone and thus, lots of people have been revived ",1
782,"expected a filler episode but no, good episode.",1
783,why would you expect filler,2
784,the first 4ish minutes of the episode misled me,2
785,I disagree then. Flashbacks don't equal filler for me.,0
786,It should when its naruto lolololol,1
787,"Christ, those Shippuden retcon episodes. . .",0
788,"There's a couple things I don't understand at the moment but maybe it'll be addressed later in the show?      Are they spying from a distance, or actually living with Tsukasa again? In either case, wouldn't he get suspicious of them being around  if he encounters them ? After all, he did ""kill"" their friend    Did Senkuu actually tell Tsukasa the formula to revive people? It seems a little illogical; he could have just told him just about anything and he probably would have believed it, or even the correct stuff but with the wrong portions so that he has to spend time ""rediscovering"" it. Without the proper formula, Tsukasa's army would be pretty much nonexistent by the time Senkuu builds his",0
789,Senku doesn't lie when science is involved.,2
790,"     With him, but think about it, they've got nobody else around, he accepts it as a marriage of convenience due to extreme circumstances. He knows they can't be friends, but he doesn't suspect Senku is still alive, and Taiju is a manic pacifist, so what would be the point in them being enemies?          Senku would never lie about science.",2
791,Her MASSIVE eyes...    It doesn't bother me... it doesn't bother me.    It bothers me! It bothers me a lot!    Also holy shit Yuzuriha is too damn cute.,0
792,"kohaku seems cool, but those eyes...i'll brave it out!",1
793,The eyes are cool the whole face tho is not proportional,1
794,"Holy shit, the OP didn't come in until 9 minutes into the episode. That was amazing.",1
795,oh man that cut between senku and taiju both waking up was great. 9min before the opening song! Im excited to see the new characters and how the conflict plays out,1
796,Good episode. Makes sense that they have to split up.     Loved the brief action between Tsukasa and that girl.,1
797,"The new girl looks at Senku like she's ready to repopulate the earth. Well, he did just save her and proven he's got a good enough chance of protecting their offsprings with science!     Still, she look dopey, not unlike Yuzuriha when talking. I assume no female character is to be spared from now on either.",1
798,"Yuzuriha's gonna have to watch out, because there's some serious bromance in this show.",1
799,"I love when the ED plays over a scene, like we saw there at the end. It got me so hyped when he finished that pulley.",1
800,The crushed tree was lifted off? Well I better just lie here because there's no chance of the rope breaking and the tree falling back down.,2
801,"Prologue over, the ""real"" Dr.Stone may finally start",1
802,6 episodes are out but there are only 4 on Funimation??    I just subbed to them and already went thru fire force and 4 eps of Dr ...,2
803,The dub is 2 episodes behind but I'm sure you can still watch the others subbed on Funi but you'll have to search.,2
804,Nice blue eyes.,1
805,"there some lines that were skipped during the ending scene     1st one was about explaining how Senku used the soap.    2nd one was when he finished making the pulley ,saying even the meathead Taiju and the unstoppable Tsukasa would be impressed by the ""herculean"" strength of the pulley.",1
806,"By this episode I can say that I truly expect the rest to be some good lots of silly fun  in a good sense, obviously  but I have still a problem... The pacing.     Goddamn, both episode 5 and 6 were pretty slow.   Watching once every week Is painful.",0
807,I'm tired of all these saber faces but this one is fine.,0
808,"""  Rofl, this is exhilarating!""  ",1
809,"So, new waifu knows what organs and bones are. She can't be totally primative.",2
810,"So a bat was flying around in daylight. Yeah, that makes total sense",2
811,this bitch is straight-up wearing   heels      what the absolute FUCK is going on,0
812,"i guess we know who the main girl is, since she looks like a pornstar.",0
813,"I like the new girl, strong women are my weakness.     I can't believe Senku put the lovebirds on a bus. LMAO.",1
814,Good show but was defiantly to hyped up.  The last few episodes have felt like the creators forgot that what we really want to see is survival science stuff.,0
815,I’m starting to not like my this show. It’s starting to get very boring and it seems like it’s dragging. And why is  forget his name  so damn strong,0
816,I feel the same but I’m going to keep watching atleast a few more episodes to see if things pick up,1
817,"One thing about this show, pretty much everyone is a little bit extra, Senku is extra genius, Tsukasa is extra Tarzan. There really aren't many ""average"" people in it. It's just something to roll with.",1
818,No we do have the one female that is very very simple. Like it’s just becoming a very normal anime. That had a lot of hype at the beginning. BUUUUUTTTTT I’m still going to watch it lol,1
819,"Who is simple? Everyone is extraordinary in this anime. If you are talking about Yuzuriha, she is very skilled in crafts of any kind, which was mentioned, but will be expanded upon later in the story. Don't know what is so normal to you about this anime, because I haven't really seen anything like it before",1
820,It’s dry. And not very intriguing anymore. I will still watch it but it doesn’t have that flare that it started with.,0
821,"I wanted to see any Yuzuriha fan art and googled ""Dr stone Yuzuriha"" and the autofill results are spoilers ;-;",0
822,"I'm not going to spoil one way or the other, but autofill results aren't necessarily accurate.",2
823,Thank you,1
824,     That's not a smart idea.,0
825,"If you're referring to what I got in my autofill, the results are all talking about Senku's ""death"" in the previous episodes.",2
826,"Yeah I am, I decided to have a proper look. I don't know why that was autofilled",1
827,They were under a tree.,2
828,They are. It's not stopping the rain though since you can see the rain hitting his body and then on his face when close up.,2
829,"So i'm pretty sure I saw someone post an out of context manga panel for this show, and I think it involved this girl. Something about they get married and divorced within the same few pages. Is that actually this girl?",2
830,No.,0
831,"I don't really like Kohaku's voice, always imagined her having a higher pitched tone. Gonna be more interesting to watch it this way though.",1
832,"Boichi, you're female character designs suck. They are literally reskins of one another.",0
833,Lol have u watched fairy tail and rave,0
834,I mean I see what you mean but what sorta argument in that. Just because it happens in other anime doesn't mean OP has to like it,0
835,I dropped Fairy Tail for other reasons but I can confidently say Hiro Mashima has uniquer designs. Erza does not resemble Lucy except in one area hehe,1
836,True. Sometimes their reaction faces look better than their normal look.,1
837,Flop anime this season,0
838,"Lol, most people like it and there are like, 4 trash-tier Isekai shows. How is this possibly the flop of the season?",0
839,He just has shit tastes.,0
840,This idiot probably started watching anime a week ago so he doesn’t know a good one from a bad one LOL,0
841,"Tsukasa sees a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl and immediately concludes that she's of a ""pure people""...",2
842,"I don't think he means it in the way of ""racially pure,"" although Gabu makes a good point about that below. I think what he means is that they are. . . ""culturally pure?"" ""Innocent?"" They lack the baggage of civilization that he's trying to fight against, so he's ok with letting them be for now.",2
843,"Exactly, this shows he has understanding of social constructs and other sociological concepts. Unfortunately, the story seems to be going towards something more authoritarian, as he throws a tree on top of her. It throws away the gentleness that he had with Senku which would hint that he had good intentions at least in theory. Now he is kinda of an evil dude.",0
844,"Both are recessive traits, meaning he's right.",1
845,I think I'm dropping this anime.  The girls look dopey and the animation is lacking qaulity.  The asspull with the neck break last episode already had me on the fence.,0
846,It's not an asspull when it's been foreshadowed since Senku decided that Tsukasa was a threat.,1
847,It was a complete asspull.   He's not actually dead because rock magic  oooh he had some hidden rock the whole time   is total bullshit when science and logic are the main themes of the story.  Foreshadowing is not actual development.,0
848,Are you the guy that complains about the dragon balls in Dragon Ball as well?,0
849,They fly around and shoot lasers in Dragon Ball.  It's not a show about using real world science and logic to solve problems like Dr. Stone presented itself as.  To me it seems like the writer couldn't think of a cool way for them to beat the caveman guy without gunpowder so he just went full  magic saves the day .,0
850,"The petrification ray is the only thing that separates Dr. Stone from ""real"" science, and the main point of the episode's intro was that it's fundamentally still based on science, because it obeys the E=MC2 law. Therefore it's not ""magic"", and Senkuu purposefully leads Tsukasa to attack the point because he understood the properties of how the petrification has the potential to heal.    An ""asspull"" would be if Taiju would have magically stumbled upon a magical equipment that would heal Senkuu. Stop using this idiotic word for situations where it doesn't apply.",0
851,How is it an asspull?,2
