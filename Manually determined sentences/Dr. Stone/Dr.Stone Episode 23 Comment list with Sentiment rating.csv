0,"I've just read the chapters shown in this episode today. Seems like we'll be finishing the season with  ""his dad's record and Lilian's song?""    Kind of a shame the season is ending, since we won't see the phone in use yet.    They also tease us Tsukasa's companions, Nikki?",0
1,"When the old OP started playing I was scared that it was the end of the episode and or season. Happily I was wrong.    And never skip arm day, that Ginro catch can only be preformed by the people willing to dedicate to their entire life to guard sitting.",0
2,"     Yeah, that bit there felt like a season finale.",1
3,Someone should convince them to greenlight a second season by telling them that it promotes interest in science.     chitosesmug,1
4,"Well there's an ""important announcement"" in next week's JUMP so it's probably happening.",1
5,Is it doing well? I love this show.,1
6,"I subscribed to Shonen Jump just to read the manga week to week, so it better be doing good.",1
7,you can read the lastest chapters from their official app.,2
8,Not sure.  But Jump is running a spin-off manga about Senku's father alongside Dr. Stone.  My Hero Academia also has a spin-off manga running.    My guess is the Dr. Stone anime and manga are doing quite well.,1
9,"sales are below all the flagship jump titles, and it only overtook Black Clover with the anime boost. However, the editorial staff seems to like it so it should be pretty safe. Also Jump can't really afford to cancel relatively successful series at the moment.",1
10,Don't know if they will have enough material since there is just one arc after this before we get to the ongoing manga arc.    Possibly they could start it in summer or fall 2020.,2
11,theres just over a season's worth more to adapt right now manga wise,1
12,"And if they don't start production immediately, which is common as far as I understand, there's plenty of time for new chapters to be released as well.",1
13,"late reply, but this episode ends at the end of chapter 58 of the manga, with the next episode probably ending at the end of chapter 60.    The manga itself is currently at chapter 132. There is quite enough material for a two cour season two.",2
14,"There’s still a lot to cover of just the stone wars, and one episode left this season if I’m not mistaken. Unless they rush we’re going to be left with a cliffhanger and won’t even wrap this arc up UNTIL season 2, and the manga will be another while ahead of the anime once again with probably another full arc completed and ready to start on.",2
15,HXH GETS NEW SEASON EEEEEEEHHHHH    jk,1
16,"I mean, when you think about it, isn't the anime just on a giant... hiatus ...?",2
17,"Hope its not a ""final manga arc""",1
18,Inagaki said 3 more years about 2 weeks ago so ur fine,1
19,Season 2 = Justice,1
20,"I flicked my mouse to see remaining time, it seemed that clean a transition into credits.",1
21,Just a training montage thankfully,1
22,"For a slight moment, as I instantly remembered that there was another episode left, I thought they were doing the equivalent to the classic ""let's left the finals of this tournament for the next season"".",2
23,"Right? It felt kinda out of place tbh, I know that the moment was kinda big but perhaps regular soundtrack would have been better. I did have a ""chotto matte"" moment when I heard it",1
24,Anyway it'll end next week which is bit hard for me to digest as it was such a good journey to come this far. Hope they'll announce next season at the end of the episode!,1
25,So soon no Dr Stone nor The Good place on Fridays. Where am I gonna get my pre-weekend positivity fix from? Life!? Nah.,0
26,My answer is probably same!,2
27,Definitely not from High School Prodigies after that abysmal episode 8 or whichever last week's was. Don't think I can bring myself to finishing it after that.,1
28,Just recently started The Good place now im depressed ive caught up!,0
29,Its so good  was not expecting such an enjoyable storyline for a comedy,1
30,Guess we'll just have to make do with Hero Academia Saturdays for now,1
31,And Vinland Sundays,2
32,Only through December. :,2
33,We still got Fire Force Friday.,0
34,"2uper is probably getting announced later this month.     While not airing on the same day, it will fill the void left in my soul.",2
35,"Harley Quinn is every Friday. I mean it's not anime, but it's wonderful.",1
36,     I sure hope they do,1
37,They better. You can’t can’t build up to a battle and then just not do it,1
38,Hopefully it won't be a movie. I hate waiting more than 6 months for those sequel movies to get at least a decent release outside Japan and the US.,1
39,"I'm crossing my fingers for a second season announcement right at the end of the next episode and maybe a PV the next week, since one week after the show ends ""Jump Festa"" starts and they already announced a Dr. Stone panel there.",2
40,Also this week's issue of Weekly Shonen Jump apparently teases major Dr.Stone news for the next issue. So a season 2 reveal is looking pretty likely next week.,1
41,"I thought it was 26 episodes, so 3 more episodes ?",2
42,Nah! it's 24 episode season.,0
43,"I swear I saw it was going to be 26 eps somewhere , welp now I'm sad.",0
44,You can recheck on My Anime List,2
45,"There is apparently going to be a major Dr.Stone announcement next week in WSJ and Jump Festa is like 3 weeks away, chances are we should be getting season 2 reveal soon.",1
46,That's goods news for us,2
47,     Luffy approves,1
48,Gomu gomu no ,0
49,I was so confused because I was pretty sure there was one episode left. It's rare having the OP play like that in the second to last episode.,1
50,I didn't even realize it was the old OP at first and was about to fastforward the episode to post-credit scenes.,2
51,Same hahahaha,2
52,"I also felt that it was the end of the season, thank God i was wrong.",1
53,Ginro really checked Kinro's vibe there,2
54,"I thought they some how messed up the episode bc it played the visuals for the first op too, not just the music",2
55,"The most wholesome moment of this entire show was when all kaseki wanted was a high five from senku. Plus, senku leaving things to chrome really makes him feel more like senkus equal in intelligence, something the shows been building to since they built the water wheel without him. Also, heating the village while geting the coal dust was a great example of senku killing two birds with one stone. Bringing back good morning world was a nice touch, even if it took me by surprise",1
56,"Yeah, I love how Senku trusts the villagers to work on things without supervision once he's trained them up a bit, especially Chrome because he's just so into it",1
57,"It really shows how much hes grown from the beginning of the series, where with taiju he basically had to babysit him whenever he had a task, to now he has several sub teams working on different projects.",2
58,"To be fair though, Taiju was a bit slow...",1
59,"Yeah, but he was a lovable kinda slow",1
60,Not so lovable or he wouldn't have been ditched,0
61,"Don't work hard enough for Senku and he'll turn you into a spy for the enemy, a true dictator.",0
62,"Fucking hell, Senku's greatest power comes not from his science knowledge but from being a scrum master.",0
63,"That's... that's the way science works. It's not just Neil Armstrong setting foot on the moon and saying 'One small step for Man. One ...Tiant leap for mankind.'    It's THOUSANDS of engineers, machinists, computer scientists, astronomers, chemists, and more, and then EVERYONE who feeds them all working in tandem. You can't have Astronauts hopping around in 16g without the seamstresses who hand-sewed the Mercury and Apollo pressure suits. HELL YES, the organizers are important.    The quote from   Jasper   Kohaku and Ruri's dad is the one I've been waiting for. 'It's completely unreleated, but everything you do just happens to enrich the village, doesn't it?'    'That's just the way science works.'    And   Jasper   the former cheiftan feels 3000 years of preparation whipping him up into Senku's plan and realizing just how very big it is.",0
64,"     I was sure you were going to finish that sentence with ""hand-sewed the Mariner and Apollo core rope memory, but that works too.",1
65,"Rope memory was woven rather than sewn, but still, the NASA guys called it 'Little old Lady Memory' for a reason.",2
66,"Wait, NASA made computers in the 1960s capable of handling moon landings with  rope !? What isn't possible!!",1
67,"Well, the computers back then weren't the general purpose things we have today.      They are more closely related to ASICs or FPGAs, where the functionality was literally built into the hardware.      It means they could do that one task super well, but were absolutely useless at anything else.      A comparison would be...    Trying to play a blue ray disk inside a dvd drive.",1
68,"NOTHING is impossible, with SCIENCE!       MUAHAHAHAHAHAA!   ",2
69,If I recall correctly - it was the women who worked for Playtex who made them - legit the only people NASA could find who could sew within the tolerance of 164th of an inch.,1
70,"'It's completely unreleated, but everything you do just happens to enrich the village, doesn't it?'    Just like many inventions were a direct consequence of the space race",0
71,That is not jasper,2
72,Well I'll be a stone statue.,1
73,Senku is an interesting character. He is a sciencey character but he does not come from the Western tradition of smart characters. These characters tends to be arrogant and assholes. But Senku is first and foremost a shonen MC. Shonen MC's are social and amicable. They are rough around the edges but a common power they have is making friends.,0
74,Like a certain Merlin?,1
75,This made my day.,2
76,"As a project manager, this makes me happy",1
77,I wonder if Tsukasa brought them along as hostages or not. It’d make sense considering how big a weak spot they are for Senku.,0
78,"Its the only reason i can see for tsukasa to keep them around, especially now that he knows senku is alive",1
79,"nah I don't think that he's ""grown"" at all as a character.He has made others grow,find their calling or influence them to become better people but Senku himself remains pretty much the same.Chrome was extraordinarily curious right from the start & Senku has always looked at him for ancillary science stuff.If anything,it shows that Senku is a great leader.",1
80,He gave purpose to other characters.,2
81,The most wholesome moment of this entire show was when Senku made cola,2
82,Suika getting her glasses is a contender for wholesome moment too,1
83,"Absolutely. The only reason it doesn't win in my opinion is because fixing her vision was necessary. Still wholesome as heck how he did it, but a wholesome byproduct",0
84,It is really relatable to the memory of getting your first pair of glasses.,2
85,"I legitimately was pissed when Good Morning World came on and tried to skip past it for some after-outro scenes, then realized that it wasn't actually the outro hahaha",1
86,They way this show shares the spotlight among characters is a treat.,1
87,The look on Chrome's face when he realized Senku saw him as an equal was really touching.,2
88,"From a primitive ""cavemen"" actually fishermen tribe, calling himself sorcerer to sound badass because deep down he realize ""stone collector"" is lame,    To a scientist, actually making change in the village.    Same with kaseki",0
89,"Yes, Chrome has been unexpectedly great since the moment he showed up.",1
90,"Damn that part with Gen singing was so cool. But what was even cooler was that final montage using the first OP.    Fuck, just one episode left. Well, I'm sure as hell will not be waiting until season 2. Right after next week's episode, I will be reading all the manga.",0
91,"i enjoy these montages ,  no dialogue just OST with the gang doing their stuff as time passes",1
92,Stone rapper Gen was so strangely funny     mmmmyrgh,1
93, Brutality on best modern boi intensifies                                        Edit: The video link got taken down,1
94,Didn't take long to get blocked,0
95,I can see it though...                         Edit: nevermind,2
96,That montage in the first episode with Senku and Taiju creating the lab and making the nital was awesome,1
97,"I'm honestly tempted to tell everyone to hold out until the next seasons, because I just want to see the first reactions to some of the batshit crazy stuff that will happen in the future. But the manga is just amazing.",1
98,Which manga chapter is next week's episode and how far along is the Manga as in chapter number?,1
99,"Next episode will start from Chapter 59, but I'd really suggest to go through the previous chapters too because the art is astonishingly good.",1
100,Also more sciencey details and extra stuff,2
101,Theres some extra stuff when Senku met Chrome. Also the art itself is worth the read,1
102,"Hopefully we get to hear that song.      The manga version made me tear up, I predict the anime version is going to leave me bawling",1
103,I predict 60 or 61,2
104,"Next week will cover 59 and 60 and maybe a bit of 61 since it would be great for a cliffhanger for next season as it's the stone wars launch chapter.    The manga is up to 120+ chapters right now so enough for another 24 episodes season, which is likely to happen since the anime seems to be really popular as well as the manga.",1
105,Don’t worry I’ll wait it out for you. <3,2
106,"I'm not reading, so don't worry.    I read chapters 1-19 so right when he got to the village when it was first coming out weekly, realized it was going to be an amazing series and stopped reading because I KNEW there was going to be an anime.    After waiting for that, I'm waiting for S2.",1
107,"Gen singing was a PPAP spoof, right?",2
108,Yeah the pen pineapple thing!,1
109,"That's a Kojima Yoshio's refference, a popular Japanese comedian back.",1
110,One of the few rappers Eminem was too afraid to diss.,2
111,I truly miss the original OP. I sing along with the intro 「おはよう世界　GOOD MORNING WOOORLLLD！g’morning wooorllld」it was refreshing to hear it again and see the dawn setting on the rotating globe.,1
112,"same, I had to hold myself back so hard not to read the manga",0
113,"Oh, do wait until next week. If what I think is coming is, it is so very worth the wait for the immense payoff.",1
114,The manga is excellent and things escalate rapidly from this point.,1
115,"I hope Kaseki lives long enough to reach their goals. I look forward to him wearing a dwarven exo-suit while assembling their spaceship to reach the moon. This episode is so good, everyone got their chance to contribute and display their uniqueness",1
116,"That's the big hand grenade the mangaka is holding. You can't make a character  this  important without the health issues the elderly would face.  At least, not if you're trying for accuracy like Dr. Stone is.",1
117,"The accuracy of an old man ripping his clothing by simply flexing and of a young man smashing the head of a lion with a kick?    Dr. Stone follows our science and our logic, but it's still shounen at hearth.     100% the old age of Kaseki will be used somehow, but this doesn't mean that it will be realistic.",2
118,Well they already used his old age this episode on how he thought he was too old to bee their crafts buddy,1
119,"I meant related to his health condition.  Kaseki getting a really bad back-pain  losing part of his sight could lead to him being less ""overpowered"" when it comes to crafting things for Senku, causing them to either help him out or he could start being a mentor for someone else that is pretty good at the same thing.",1
120,They need to train more apprentices for  Kaseki. Hopefully Chrome and Suika and some villagers lika the fatso Ganen,1
121,"I think its more likely they'll just revive people who are into crafts, and then they can be best buddies with Kaseki. Yuzuriha was in a crafts club too, so they might even make her the successor",1
122,Would be epic seeing Yuzuriha blowing glass and pounding metal,2
123,"Right? I'm hoping they'll actually do that, or at least have her teach Kaseki all kinds of cool new tricks",1
124,"        Gotta disagree here, the fact no one has died yet even without modern medicine and technology is weird. Then you have all the problems related to massive incest and that they are getting resources too fast to be even real    Theorically all they do is possible , but it is impossible to get all the needed resources",0
125,Chrome has created a headstart by hoarding materials since he was young,1
126,"The ending sequence with the first opening was fucking hype man.    Also, when Kaseki cried, i've cried too. It must have been hard for him to live his whole life without being aknowlodge by his skills, i will cry if he dies in the anime.    Also ,can we give extra appreciation for Senku for using time for building the cellphone to build a steam roomfor the old and kids? If my boss was just like his lol.",2
127,"Dude he didn’t just make one for the kids,  every  house has one now, he literally providing heating to every home as a  side project ",2
128,"Well it's not totally a side project, they need to burn the coal somehow, and it's just efficient to use it for heating since otherwise it's just excess energy being wasted.",1
129,Happy workers are far more productive,1
130,"tell that to every employer I've ever had, please",1
131,"ya, i wish this is common sense to employers.",1
132,"Acquiring coal ash, making a heating system and stoves simultaneously, enhancing the well-being and productivity of workers and the technological advancement of the village... he just killed a whole V-formation of birds with one stone huh",0
133,He probably used a catapult.,2
134,A trebuchet...,2
135,"Not to mention that being cold slowed down the work of the others, so not only is it a quality of life upgrade for everyone, it also boosts the efficiency of the other projects going on. It's just all around a very pragmatic thing to do.",1
136,"A happy & healthy workforce is an efficient workforce. That's what scientific civilisation  should  be all about. Sadly, ours seems to have lost sight of that...",1
137,"Why make massively more profits as a whole, if I can make less but keep all of it for myself by abusing my workforce?",0
138,Why have a better long term workforce if I can just bleed them dry so I can profit  now ?,1
139,Have we? We've pulled more people out of abject poverty than ever before BECAUSE of capitalism and the average quality of life for humans on Earth is the highest it's ever been throughout history.    This is literally the benchmarkgoal that Senku is trying to hit lol...,0
140,More than half of that was by redefining abject poverty.,0
141,"No it wasn't, it was because we made products that increase quality of living so god damn cheap anybody could afford them.",2
142,"Please go to really impoverished countries once in your life. They aren't lacking cheap plastic shit, it's infrastructure, chemicals and machinery. And it didn't get all that better.    Besides, abject poverty was literally redefined. And it massively failed to take into account inflation or rising material prices.    If you really want to fix abject poverty, it's absolutely 100% not about making stuff cheaper, it's about political change to allow actual development and safety. And I'm sure you'll notice the political situation is far from improving. The reason why senku succeeds in the anime is literally because he isn't being capitalist at the very beginning. He isn't trying to exploit the poor villagers by talking as much profit as possible while investing in the least amount of infrastructure and education possible, like what's happening in say the DRC, but instead he's building a ton of infrastructure, explaining exactly how its working, forming engineers and scientists, stabilizing the political situation without tyranizing the citizens of the village, collectivizing the profits and fruits of the citizens labor and so on. He isn't making an iPhone to ship it off thousands of kilometres away because he owns imaginary intellectual property rights, neither is he extracting minerals from dying communities, bribing and manipulating  in order to politically destabilize as much as possible.    This is the thing, you actually don't know what capitalism is. And you don't know from where poverty really comes from. It's not because a smartphone is becoming less expensive, it's about the price of steel, machining, the local chemical industry, and so on. That much should be clear from watching the anime. And it turns out for a ton of these poor countries either the political situation is so fucked that it's impossible to make good long term local investments, or the wages are kept low enough while flooding the market with foreign products to prevent local industry from growing. Add to that intellectual property rights which would prevent them from doing what Senku did and which, oddly enough, are almost always only enforced for industry matters in poor countries and you've got yourself the actual explanation for poverty. Trust me, having a 25$ smartphone that can barely run candycrush isn't a worthwhile trade for being unemployed while the family farm is being outcompeted by the foreign industrial farm and there is a group of warlords eyeing the mineral resources nearby, coming into violent conflict.    This is a long winded comment, but essentially, no we aren't doing much do fix poverty. We're not even trying, actually. Really fixing poverty and getting the machine going in Africa, middle Asia and so on is so much against our interests that we just won't do it.    That's the thing, right. Tsukasa isn't actually wrong in some of his analysis of the root cause of the issue, he's just way too stupid and hubristic to realize that his solution will never work. And Senku does realize that the society he would actually be rebuilding and the society he has grown in the village are politically so far removed from one another, it's just that he's just kinda given up on trying to do much better which is fair. I'd imagine that when some of the greedier people he revived try to stop his project of reviving everyone in order to secure more power or resources he will have to come to terms that his experiment worked in large part because he hasn't replicated the old political structure. If Tsukasa actually had absolutely no argument at all it would be a much lesser anime.",0
143,"In what way? We live pretty damn fuckin good lives in the developed world.    Even a lot of our poor people are rich by the world's standards.    A lot of people are unhappy not because they don't have enough, but because they're convinced they need more.",1
144,"Because that ethos of ""A happy & healthy workforce is an efficient workforce"" has been lost. People are heavily overworked, despite overworking being harmful to actual productivity. Vital professions are shat on and get their funding scraped to the barest of bones, and are then blamed themselves when everything goes tits up.",1
145,"Also, the more he boosts the village's quality of life, the easier it'll be to convince people on Tsukasa's side to defect. It really is effective from multiple angles.",1
146,Meanwhile my house still have no power heating   sob  ,0
147,"i think the animator forgot to put in ""Stove Acquired""",2
148,He needs the coal ash so making a stoveheater was just a small detour on getting that material. Also just in time for winter. Senku is not a heartless man...  remembers spartan creating session with the village  ...probably.,1
149,     Dr.Feels at it again,2
150,"I guess this means they didn't even have simple fireplaces before in the houses, which is a little surprising",1
151,Theres a scene during the introduction of the village a family having a meal inside the hut with a campfire,2
152,"     Me too! As a maker, this hit a bit too close to home and I can attest that the sentiment is very real.    It can be a very isolating hobby if no one around you understands what you're doing, but on the other hand, it's infinitely more fun when you find like minded people.",1
153,Hahahahaha    yes.,1
154,S H I M A T T A,2
155,Whoopsie,2
156,"Considering that looks a lot more like a radio than a phone, maybe not",1
157,"Well, yes, but you would still need a second radio, right?",1
158,"Depends if you're aiming for bidirectional communication or more of a broadcasting style system. For bidirectional, I think they would. For broadcasting they just need receivers which should be easier to make and I'd think they'd have made some initially.",1
159,"To really get the benefit, they'd need two-way capabilities.",1
160,Not if the main radio is high enough to see the full battle field.,0
161,Which it seems with the observatory...,2
162,The observatory is no where in line of sight of tsukasa. Weren't they planning on taking the fight to him instead of waiting?,0
163,"that will be the main antenna that receives and sends signals, the others will have more portable radios with just enough signal strength to reach that antenna",1
164,"yep, this is the big boi rebroadcasting tower",1
165,"I think that this is a receiver transmitter, and thry need to build the other one.",2
166,Imagine if they turned it on and they immediately got an incoming call though.,2
167,"""Hello this is the IRS""",2
168,“We’re calling to inquire about the missing 3700+ tax return you have yet to file.”,0
169,"""New world who dis?""",2
170,"""FCC Calling. Shut down your illegal broadcasting equipment or we'll send in our  army of lawyers"" ",0
171,We're calling you about your cars extended warranty,2
172,"Hallo. We are finding suspicious activities on your social security number. Please to be giving us your informations so we can fix, and don't have to deactivate your social security number.",1
173,   You have one missed call from Scam Likely   ,0
174,OHAIIOO SEKAIIIII ,2
175,"They need to make more transceivers, but this is meant to be the ""radio tower""",2
176,"Huh, they're doing it proper cell phone style instead of walkie talkie style? I figured that having a central cell tower would be a bad move as it means they have one big target that if taken down shuts down their entire communication network, while a decentralized solution would be harder to take down.    Guess it'd be more resistant to stolen phones though.",0
177,"The enemy doesnt even know the existance of the radio tower, so being taken down is unlikely.    Tsukasa will probably realize whats going on when things start going wrong, but even then they will be too busy to deal with anything else",0
178,"They don't know of it  yet , but it should be found out as soon as anyone is seen with a phone or until Tsukasa notices how coordinated they are and deduces that they must have phones. After that point, Tsukasa seems smart enough that he should have some idea of where to look for it.",1
179,I think everyone is forgetting that Tsukasa's group all come from the modern age and understand technology unlike the village,2
180,"And they already know they have Homura, another modern day person, watching everything they do. Maybe she wouldn't have recognized that pile of parts for what it is, but then they painted the words SENKU'S PHONE on it.",2
181,"When I saw the giant label saying SENKUS PHONE, I thought “well this might bite them in the ass later”    The enemy would probably be looking around for the means of communication and spot that giant label and be along the lines of “Hey, that was easy”",0
182,"I mean, they're probably gonna torch it anyways. They already torched the village once. What's busting some weird machine?",0
183,"Or they might see it and get impressed by how advanced Ishigami Village is, and join Senku?",1
184,"Could also just be a repeater to amplify the signals of smaller, more portable devices.",2
185,"If they just want something that can receive the sound, it's actually really easy. You remember those salt crystal things they made? They can pick up vibrations emitted by the radio. So all you have to do is put one of those things inside of a megaphone, and bam. It would take all of two seconds.    EDIT: Here's a modern-day version of a rochelle salt speaker. It's stupidly easy to build: ",1
186,"I don't know, one of those could be too small, what if an enemy stole one without their knowledge?",0
187,"Technically speaking, the enemy wouldn't need to steal one, they'd just need to make some rochelle salts of their own. They're painfully easy to make.",0
188,"They're kinda dumb though. I mean I didn't know how to build one of those things, and I'm slightly less dumb than most.",0
189,"In that case, they wouldn’t know to steal a rochelle salt in the first place. Who would imagine that all you need to build a speaker is some salt?",0
190,        ,2
191,"Just taping the salt to the back of the paper cup would have been enough. It would just be super quiet, which is fine since they would hold the cup up to their ear anyways.    The wires connecting the cup just amplified the signal.",1
192,But how will they remotely send messages?,2
193,They'll need two if they want to have two-way communication.,1
194,"Yeah, this is a plot twist for the villagers.",1
195,Same that memereaction for next week.,2
196,If only someone they want to try to have contact with happened to have some sort of device that can output sound and can be retrofit into a receiver.,1
197,The gorilla pun never gets old.    Specially if you consider Kohaku hides a 6-pack under that slender body of hers,0

200,"lol a non-slender body would hide a 6 pack, a slender body ""revealing"" the six pack is the reason it can b seen when you're low body fat;     ;    but I guess u mean the rest of her doesnt look particularly muscular, but everyone has the ab muscles haha",1
201,"Yep, basically everyone has a six pack somewhere under their skin, the question is if they're thin enough for it to show through.",1
202,"Or if it's bulky enough, of course!",2
203,"Not at all, you can have the bulkiest core muscles ever but they're not gonna show if you have fat on top of them.",1
204,I think the only exception I remember is Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin. You can see some good abs in some training scene.,1
205,"We have seen her in a bikini, she doesn't have a 6 pack. Just another example of the usual anime trope of portraying strong girls without actually having toned musclesfire force is a nice exception.",1
206,"To be fair, healthy people aren't toned. Rigid tone comes from being fit  and  dehydrated. Otherwise you just end up with hard muscles  under  a little squishy fat.",1
207,"Realistically, she would look as fit as Maki, maybe more buff, but the Bochi has a very unusual way of drawing girls.",1
208,If this was realistic then kohaku would be weaker than all the fit boys simply because she is a girl.    Luckily we don't have to follow what is realistic.,1

220,"I've only known Grandpa Kaseki for 12 episodes, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone and then myself.",0
221,Kaseki is actually Senkuus strongest ally.  The dude is insanely talented.,1
222,Without him they'd be dead to Tsukasa.,0
223,"They also wouldn't have been able to make the Sulfa drug at all no gas masks, centrifuge or complex glasswork.",0
224,"Exactly. Senku might have the knowledge necessary but that doesn't mean he can actually make the equipment on his own- it would have taken him and extreme amount of time to do the most basic glasswork or even woodwork as we have seen him trying to make that part for a gear from a tree trunk some eps ago, and yet without them he would not be able to do anything.     ;    Kaseki is really a power ally",2
225,"Senku would need to find a way to call Yuzuriha back somehow, and whatever plan he had would be a bust.",2

230,Old age might be his worst enemy but he still has the body of somebody 50 years younger.,0
231,Isn't he 50...?,2
232,He is 50 years older than SenkuChrome so he's in late 60s probably,2
233,He's TECHNICALLY younger than Senku.,2
234,I was half expecting Senku to bring that up when Kaseki asked if they consider him their friend despite being over 50 years older than them,1
235,"It almost would have been funner if Senku said something like ""Even though you're 3000 years younger, you're still my friend""",1
236,That rock wrapping treatment just did wonders to his skin is all.,2
237,"people died before their 50s in middle age.    Remember, before Senku arrived, they were mostly hunter-gatherer so a lot pre middle age society.",0
238,"Obligatory: ""That's a misconception.""    Dying during childbirth was much higher at that point in time skewing the average life expectancy.  If a person made it past early childhood, their odds of making it to old age weren't much worse than modern people.",1
239,"If you can be pedantic, I can also be pedantic and please don't take this as condescending:         That is so wrong between disease, famine and war.    We live in an absolutely unprecedented age of prosperity.",0
240,"It helps that Kaseki is also a craftsman, and not someone who regularly has to put their life on the line for their work.    That's actually why ""Smith"" is the most common English last name, because the blacksmiths were the ones who got to stay safe during wartimes while everyone else had to go out and fight. Likewise, ""Pikeman"" is one of the rarest last names specifically because pikemen were the frontlines of most battles.",2
241,That makes sense. Thanks for the info,1

267,What do you mean everything? The mangas ongoing of course they can't,2
268,"I mean for this arc. Everything they actually  do  with the cellphone now that they have it would require two episodes or more, to say nothing of the conflict with Tsukasa.",1

272,"   Plastic  !    I am gonna explain in details how they did do it because they skipped about most of the stuff for the viewers which is appreciated.    So The reason they needed coal is not just to burn it, Senku want to extract something called   Naphtha  . It's a flammable hydrocarbon chemical. They extract it from Coal distillation. Naphtha is used as a catalyst to start the reaction of plastic making.    So the next thing they want is a monomer A single unit that will form a long chain of a monomers that would be called a Polymer. The most common monomer is Ethylene   C2H4  , they did get it from dehydrating wine those crystals are Ethylene Basically sugar crystals, now they just carry on with the reaction, Naphtha is further decomposed thermally and separated utilizing the difference in the boiling point temperature at which the phase change from liquid to gas occurs to form ethylene. Boom! plastic baby.    The thing with refining Tungsten is beyond what I know. But I did a fast research to see what I can get.    It's Calcium Tungstate CaWO4 or CaO4W it falls into the Scheelite category. Senku used ammonia to extract it from the ore. He first must make Ammonium Paratungstate:         The next step is just to make it powder, which is init self a long process that requires a lot of heating and Senku used it right when he make heating out of it. Although it's not safe lol.       The blue oxide is then reduced by hydrogen to metallic tungsten powder in stationary furnaces at temperatures ranging from 550 to 850 C 1,025 to 1,550 F. In this process the oxide is loaded into “boats” made of Inconel, a nickel-based alloy noted for its strength at high temperatures. These are stoked into tubes, usually arranged in two rows, and the tubes are heated in three separate zones along their lengths.    APT may also be reduced by carbon, although the powder is usually contaminated with tungsten carbide and some mineral elements contained in the carbon. When APT and carbon are mixed and reacted at 650–850 C 1,200–1,550 F, the product is a blue oxide. When heated in the range of 900–1,050 C 1,650–1,925 F, the brown oxide is formed. For complete reduction to metal, a temperature higher than 1,050 C is required. The purity of the metal is about 95 percent.    That's what I got from how to refine Tungsten from ore, I just read it all, and boy I am glad I am not working in chemistry section, let me play with physics lmao.",1
273,Thanks Mecha senku,1
274, Mecha Senku,2
275,Thanks Senku,1
276,"     I still don't understand why they need plastic. Sure, plastic is light and durable, but the housing could be anything, the coil could wrap around anything nonconductive, wires would be fine for connecting components, etc.",1
277,I think they needed it for the microphone too.,2
278,"Yeah, I think the material need they had there was ""light weight, rigid, thin, and durable."" Glass would be a bit too heavy or brittle, plastic can vibrate easily with little pressure, without breaking.",1
279,"I'm not sure why they're using bakelite, especially since you need a bakelizer to make it properly.    Without a bakelizer most attempts to make bakelite will just produce a pink foam.",0
280,Does the heating apparatus they used for the plastic making act as a convincing substitute for a bakelizer?,1
281,You tell me.,2
282,yeah the difference is the bakelizer you showed is a commercial one optimized for mass production.,1
283,The Bakelizer prevents the resin from foaming by using pressure.,0
284,"To make a contact microphone Using the piezoelectric properties of Rochelle salt you don't  need  plastic, you could probably get away with some textile.     Honestly it makes more sense to me that way since they're likely going to be used as throat mics anyway.",1
285,"Bakelitethe plastic they made is relatively easy in its components to make, as well as was heavily used in the early 20th century in the fledgling electronics industry due to its extremely high resistance to heat, electrical conductivity, and chemical action. As well as now they can produce a myriad of different electronics, and luxuries with it such as better glasses frames, buttons, lamps, etc",1
286,"Plastic is an insulator. With unregulated energy, considering they're probably using direct current, rather than alternating current. Having plastic as an insulator helps a ton to keep people from shocking to death. That's pretty much what I thought it was.",1
287,"I don't think the voltage involved is enough to hurt people, but a short-circuit would prevent the radio from working.",0
288,"Did you see the batteries they have? Cause those are some massive batteries, with energy that has no safety nets. At least, not the same nets we have now. Do you know what direct current does compared to alternating current? Direct current is dangerous because it causes the body to freeze up due to the electric shock, which unfortunately prolongs the exposure to the wiring or power.  Alternating current does not, which is why if you stick your finger in a outlet, you can pull out your finger.        It also, like you say, stops it from short circuiting. Which is definitely an important thing, seeing as they don't have the time or resources to make another one. This is their only chance, after all.",1
289,"     I would say that AC and DC does not matter, as long as the current is more that 0.1A 100mA and it goes through you, you're good as fucked. That is why from where I live, a 30mA RCCBresidual current circuit breaker is required for every residential household. Upon detecting a residual leak of 30mA or more, it just trips, therefore protecting whoever was unlucky enough to touch the equipment. If you stick 2 fingers in to both live and neutral, you'll probably trip the RCCB while getting some shock. Stick one finger in and it does nothing, as you have not completed the electrical loop.    You can run 230Vac through the body and still be fine. I know a few people who daisy chained themselves and ran a couple of volts during lab sessions. Wearing safety shoes and standing on rubber mats, with supervision of course. Assuming 100,000 ohm per humandry, 230V100,000 x 4 = 0.000575 A. Which is 0.058 mA. They did not feel anything at all.      The part where bakelite is being used to prevent electric shocks should be correct. It is, after all, low in conductivity. I'm also guessing structural, weight and mold issues if you were to have wooden cases around.",0
290,They need it for the circuit board. I guess you could consider making it out of wood but it probably would be much harder because of how small the pieces need to be.,2
291,Chemistry is just playing math with rocks. And the more info we get from physics boys the more stuff we can cook up. Huzzah this show is motivational!,1

294,Yes.,1
295,So these are all plausible?,2
296,"Yes they are, but they need hella amount of work to do. In the anime it was skipped and a little bit simplified not that much. If you want to do it in your backyard, you can but it wouldn't be perfect 'cause of little things mixed with it from the air and stuff.",0

298,"     Haha, my thoughts exactly. Am in constant awe about how much Chemists can remember.",1
299,"        It's interesting to me, as a plant operator in a chemical plant that makes 40+ metric tonshr of polyethylene, what kind of primitive methods they used to accomplish it. I could go into great detail on how our low pressure gas phase reactor works to turn ethylene gas +11 secret herbs and spices into polyethylene resin and all the other factors that go into its creation, but I had no idea that wine would leave behind crystals containing ethylene and so never thought they'd be making plastic that easily. Senku really knows everything.",1
300,"Ooooh, now please explain how the furnace that Chrome made to heat the tungsten paste works!",1
301,This can already be a filler episide,2
302,hi i am currently studying polymere engineer at university.     they actually used those crystals from the wine to make Rochelle salt which produce elektricity when hit by sound and not plastic.    additionally wouldn't ethylene just give you polyethylene+ they would need to build a reaction chamber to get a polymerisation going? Senku said they want to make bakelit which is a resin u get from a condensation of phenol and formaldehyd. it was actually used as a casing for the first home-telephones. i am actually currently studying for a exam in polymere chemistry and i finished the chapter about resins and the name bakelit sounded familiar.,1
303,"Weren't the sugar crystals used for the Rochelle salts? The bakelite was made with coal, sodium hydroxide and something else - with formaline as a precursor, and bakelite anyway is polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, not polyethylene.    Also the crystals weren't sugar, but potassium bitartrate.",2
304,"I am pretty sure that dehydrating wine gives Ethylene.. and yes the sugar crystals potassium bitartate are the one who were used to make Rochelle salts. Although polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride or Bakelite is what we were told that he did in the anime, but I am seeing contradiction for what happened in the anime and what is said to be. Yes Bakelite making is very similar for Polyethylene making, but they need different things. It might just be a mere confusion for me though, you might be right... Chemistry isn't my play ground anyway, it's physics.",1
305,"I'm a physicist too, I'm just going off what they did. I think if they say it's bakelite that's what it is, they've done their research until now, it'd be strange to make such a blunder. Besides bakelite truly is history's first plastic, so it makes sense it should be easier to synthesise than polyethylene, despite one might think the contrary. Besides, all they could get is LDPE, which is pretty crappy as a material; HDPE can not be produced without specialised catalysts.",1
306,"Naphtha is pretty darn good catalyst, and he surely done that by just distilling coal tar. I don't know, I need to do more research next time, what I said was what I all had. But seems there are easier plastic to make than polyethylene, I though that's was the easiest.",1
307,"Naphta certainly isn't a catalyst for the Ziegler-Natta process, which is what I was referring to:    Ziegler-Natta catalyst",1
308,"damn, they speedrunned the last parts of making cell phones, I like how everyone was amazed when they didn't even test it if it works",1

312,"Did Kohaku just ""ok boomer"" her dad?",1
313,"Wait until they get the first children born in the age of science for some serious disconnect.    ""You better eat all your food, you don't know how lucky you have it! When I was your age, we didn't have agriculture! We just went out there and actually hunted and gathered everything we needed to survive!""    ""Yeah, yeah, sure, mom...""",1
314,Except hunting and gathering is far superior to agriculture. Agriculture fucking sucks dude.,1
315,"Agriculture is what allows civilization. Agriculture leads to cities, which leads to society, which leads to division of labor, which allows some people to work on actually progressing civilization.",2
316,"He's not wrong. The hunter-gatherer life provides a substantially higher standard of living than agrarian production. It isn't until you reach industrialization that civilized people start living healthier, longer lives than hunter-gatherers. And prior to modern sanitation, cities were cramped, dirty, polluted, disease-ridden cesspools. Only the wealthy enjoyed the benefits; everyone else got a worse deal than the ""uncivilized"".",1
317,"No shit, but you're confusing cause and effect. The need for cities gave rise to agriculture. H&G is far more productive and time effective food generation method. What it is not is LAND effective. If you are not land limited, you should not do agriculture.",1
318,But H&G groups weren't advancing science. That takes specialists who can't spend time on their basic needs and need others to provide them. A H&G group can't support those dead weights. The specialists also need many and they need to be concentrated so they can collaborate. Life did take a quality dive in the transition but it them bloomed into our modern society.,1
319,That's not true. HG is more time effective than early farming. You can absolutely support lots of dead weights so long as you have enough resources. Obviously enough resources doesn't exist anywhere in the scale necessary to support cities.,1
320,"sigh silly argument, the only thing that matters in the long run is number of people. the more people you have, the more likely one of them is euclid, which means cities are always better",1

325,"Well yeah, though ""early on"" is 99% of the history of agriculture. Agriculture only stopped sucking when people didn't have to do agriculture.",1
326,We do still do it though. It was us moving to agriculture that let us then move everyone out of it. There is no way to modernize H&G to the point it can sustain massive cities.,0
327,"     No, machines do for the most part. We just direct them and then let them do the work.         The people in this show don't have to follow history. They can skip steps because they already have the knowledge.     They can just be H&G until they have a need for agriculture and then straight away create advanced farming tools.",1

373,"That's probably the most logical reason for it. I feel like radios aren't ""that old"" yet, but who knows. I'm only 25, but to be fair, i probably wouldn't have thought of radios as big boxes with antennae very often in comparison to like walkie talkie radios if it weren't for my grandpa being a radio operator.",1
374,"Well I guarantee if he'd said ""radio"" instead of ""cell phone"" you'd have far less drive to read the next chapter, right? It's already obviously not a cell phone because it can't be transported like one, which I think of as the key component of a ""cell phone""",1
375,"no, not really.",0
376,"I put it down to radio seeming much more attainable of a goal than a phone, while the overlap between the two is enough to be acceptable. So for marketability claiming it'll be a phone is more impressive",1
377,"I kind of disagree with you on that. So far the show hasn't strayed away from scientific terminology that people might not know. They do a pretty good job at explaining it too in an easily understood way when the time comes for using it. I imagine that the episode it gets used for the first time, they will explain the physics of whats going on with it.",1
378,"Well I assume they are making something with two way communication instead of just a broadcasting station, so calling it a phone would be more accurate.",1

386,It took roughly 4.543 billion years before I was a kid.,2
387,That’s quite a bit of technology you missed out on,0
388,"That's my point. We know about stuff like record players, spinning jennys, and castles, but how much weird shit like in this video do we not even know we don't know about?",0
389,Baby cages! God this guy is hilarious,1
390,So what are they gonna do with the receiver?,2
391,build a sender as well? and give it to whoever does their scouting?,1
392,I'm guessing they're making something like this.,1
393,"It’s the bare basics. One of the best things about advancing science and technology is minimizing things, making them more compact and portable. The first computers took up entire rooms, now they can fit in your pocketSmartphones.",1
394,     To get the same processing power as the early computers you only need a millimeter-scale SoC. A smartphone by comparison is a Tesla vs a horse and buggy.,2
395,"Funnily enough, we had electric cars in the same era that we used horse and buggies. Electric cars lost to steam and fuel driven cars though.",1
396,I don't see how that's going to fit into your pocket unless you're a Minecraft character.,1
397,villager from animal crossing,2
398,They just need to make some pants with huge pockets. Which might as well be an opportunity to introduce the village to the spinning jenny.,1
399,"That antenna thing is literally an antenna, the receiver is probably inside the box. The manganese batteries I assume are kind of like an internal battery, while the liquid ones are there so the manganese doesn't get wasted before they need to use it?",1
400,"No, the manganese batteries are needed for the high voltage terminal on the vacuum tube. The other lead-acid batteries are for the main power source and heating element.",0
401,Thanks!,1
402,"For me it's the ""cell"" part that I don't see lol They really should have said they were building a radio or something, this is not a cellphone by any stretch of the imagination.",0
403,Looks similar to those WW1 radios,2
404,and it looks like ww1 squad photo,1
405,"I was so confused when I saw that thing. It was nowhere near the old radio phone I know. Then the rod ""electrified"" the whole landscape and it hits me:  This is like a cellular towertransmitterreceiver thing isn't it?. Wait, That is still nowhere near the phone I know! ",0
406,"It could be  part  of the phone you know though, if the plan is to make it work as a cell tower.",2
407,"when I watch the episode, I might be able to explain a little bit of whats going on with it. I work as an engineer for antennas and had another job making and testing Power Amplifiers for cell phones. My guess is that they are making an omni antenna that can do both transmit and receive, then using a series of tube amps to amplify the RF signal so that it can be transformed back to audio. Since there shouldn't be any other RF flying though out that area, they probably wont have to worry much about filtering out any out of band noise and just deal with the noise of the signal which, I think tube amps have a pretty good linear amplifying range with low noise amplification. Which is why they are used in amps for guitars and what not still. I could be wrong on that though. I would expect the audio to be pretty choppy though and that it will be hard to hear the other person clearly. My question though is how are they going to get another one of those built and delivered north, without detection and more importantly, without damaging the tube amps. they are really sensitive to vibrations...really really sensitive to vibration.",1
408,     It's likely a broadcasting station and they just need to make receivers.,2
409,"I gotcha     the center part is an antenna, the radio tower everyone is talking about, bellow it there is a master switch and a vacuum tube to control the flow of current    To the right those are batteries, different from the ones Gen was making. Those ones are probably stronger batteries meant to power the antenna, see how they are connected in series?, that's what you do when you want to increase the voltage in a circuit. Individual radios will be able to work with the manganese-zinc batteries but we are yet to see those in action    For the record, radios are easy to make, they used to make them in literal bread boards, you just need those crystals, an antenna and a couple of transistors, if you are close enough to the radio tower you might not even need batteries    To the left is the actual circuit, have you seen pictures of those old switchboards in which operators would connect and disconnect cables when people wanted to talk to each other?, this is that    That thing is probably made of vacuum tubes connected in such a way as to produce the simple logic gates that a radio needs. Knowing this show, Senku probably made it in such a way that changing who you are talking to just requieres switching one wire from place to place and Suika will do it    I'm not sure how they will know how to connect the calls though...    Anyway, I might be wrong, electronics is not my strong-suit",0
410,"This is probably a super simple cellphone that converts eletricity and mechanical waves into metallic sound, there was something simillar in a science museum i've went, basically you would talk and you would receive the awnser across a yard metal trough vibrations.",1
411,"Mom, can we have a cell phone.    We have cell phone at home.    Cell phone at home.",2
412,"I had to do a double take near the end when the first OP started playing. I thought for a moment that this was the last episode. Can't wait for next week, hope S2 is confirmed.",1
413,I just realized making a phone is basically like crafting the Terra Blade from Terraria.,1
414,More like the cell phone,1
415,More like crafting the ankh shield,1
416,"Nah it's more like the Cell phone. Most of the stuff isn't too bad to get if you know what you're doing, but then you have that FUCKING fisherman and his bullshit RNG once a day drop BULLSHIT that means that nobody actually gives enough of a shit to get it legit.",0
417,I got the achievement for completing 200 fishing quests before I got all three parts I needed from him. The game was lucky I loved fishing.,1
418,"     I feel attacked.    ""It's just question of grinding and it will eventually drop, maybe I should just put it in my Character and when it drops I'll delete it""",0
419,"I took the time to stockpile a large amount of quest fish using the safebank trick, but still ended up save scumming for the cell phone quest rewards.",1
420,I just use save editors once I got all the other pieces normally. There's no reason to waste so much time on them.,0
421,"No save editors on consoles!     However, I used a save editor to ""transfer"" my post Moon Lord character over to the PC version, since the Switch is still pre 1.3.4 meaning no Old One's Army, no Tavern Keep, and a whole bunch of other good stuff.     I want to go back to playing on my Switch, but I just can't stand the delayed updates.",1
422,"Was about to say, lol.",1
423,Or even better: the phone from Terraria,1
424,Or like those very endgame weapons from calamity mod,0
425,"Or like the  ""Exo Blade"" from Calamity, a Terraria mod.",1
426,I love how they keep using Godzilla to represent how heat resistant tungsten is.      Well this just shows how confident Senku is in his friend's abilities as a scientist. Letting him take care of this project on his own without needing to help him. And that was also some heartwarming sentiment given to Kaseki there.      Everybody wants some high fives.      And Gen gets his own musical montage... o-kay... but then it was followed up by one using the first op so it all evens out.,1
427,           Pretty much the currency of the science kingdom.,1
428,"Evens out? I think you meant to say ""makes it even better"".",2
429,"When they were talking about having maker friends, I was like ""This is so heartwarming.. When are Old Man Kaseki's clothes ripping of--YEP THERE IT IS""    The new hit Manganese Rice Balls is the hottest track of the 58th century, could warm up the whole village with that fire    How exactly is that a cell phone? Though they haven't explained it yet, that seems more to me like a cell phone  tower . Which if that's the case, that is NOT what I was expecting since they kept saying cell phone and not cell phone tower. Then again, this whole time I was wondering both how they were going to make portable enough cell phones  and  how they were going to get service for said phones.     I really hope they don't leave us with a massive cliffhanger for the final episode. I can't imagine a whole battle being resolved in 20 something minutes.",1
430,Their cellphone is basically walkie talkie. One with tower plus another one being portable military style,2
431,Is the central tower a repeater? That's the CB setup we use in school bus driving.,2

437,I think they are aiming towards some sort of radio tower with little devices which can keep track those radio waves,2
438,It is basically an early radio. They still thousands of steps away from making real modern cell phone.,2
439,"Honestly, I think it's a translation issue, either from language to language or from generation to generation. Maybe ""keitai"" is just how the Japanese refer to any portable communications device. Or maybe Senku is so young he just doesn't know any other word for portable communications devices.",1
440,"     Literally means mobile, short for ketai denwa mobile telephone. And the roadmap shows a cellphone, maybe it's not what Senku's actually making, but if it's not, the cellphone analogy is clearly intentional. If Senku wanted to say ""transceiver"", he probably would have Toranshībā .",1

445,I mean Senku already has his own cellphone brand...,2
446,Lets just hope that his data plans are reasonable,1

448,Truly the greatest invention of science.,1
449,"It took a petrifying beam to remove all human from Earth and thousand years to reclaim the world from man made pollution. And Senku was just like, ha, Plastic! CO2 emission! I'm bringing the Gang back together!",1
450,"I don't think a society like this, living in straw huts etc care a whole lot about the elderly..    If you can walk, see, hear and haven't gone senile, you can work.      And children gotta learn too, ain't no soccer practice or higher education in the Stone World lmao",1
451,"Someyhing Tsukasa doesn't get about civilization is that's exactly how it works.        Pre industrial revolution those who couldnt work in the fields would work in food processing or textiles.  Look at traditional weaving for an example.  It's tedious, time consuming, and a suboptimal use of resources if you need food.   But if you have elderly folk who can do it, they can use it to make nets and ropes--among other things and thats a huge leap forward.  Part of the reason civilization and farming surpass hunter gathering is that it allows more people to contribute.",1
452,"No, he gets it. He totally gets it. It's why he's determined to nip it in the bud before it gets out of hand.    Civilization is wonderful for total production. But for reasons that are pretty much a mystery to the vast majority of people, it also has a tendency to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few, who can then use that power and wealth to concentrate it even further. What begins as people working together ends up in some form of servitude at a level of compensation that barely exceeds what could be had from the world by one's own hands, if only one could get hold of the necessary resources any more.    Tsukasa doesn't know what causes it; he only knows it is associated with modern civilization. He intends to prevent this by preventing or at least delaying for a few hundred years the emergence of civilization. He knows he can't beat Senku once he gets going. He needs to beat him ASAP. Tsukasa's growth is linear, Senku's is geometric. Tsukasa's advantage grows since he has the revival formula, but eventually Senku's will pass his.",1
453,"He's too much of an idealist to realize he doesn't understand.      Division of Labor is pretty much fundamental to being human, and to any pack or familial structure.  Even ants understand that organism are just better when working in concert.      Humans have two, or three basic desires.  Safety, Significance, and Sex.      It's not an uncommon sort of existential angst.  Thanks to science, safety is so easy that our needs for Significance, and Sex begin to carry a heavier weight  The petrification on the other hand, stripped away safety entirely, flipping the modern paradigm on its head.      Tsukasa, when he awoke and punched out a lion, was probably the happiest he'd ever been in his life.  Suddenly society fell in synchronization with his personal strengths.  He -wants- to be relied on.  As ""the strongest primate highschooler"" it's a validation of who he's always been, and who he's always been told he is.  That's why he formed the Tsukasa Empire rather than being a lone wolf, and really a great explanation for why he wouldn't just straight up kill Senkuu's friends after Senkuu ""died"".  He thinks they need him.",1
454,"The thing is,  he's not wrong  about the association of agrarianism and ultimately modernity with a vicious distribution of property. And ironically, given the stone world is populated entirely by people who either know no science at all, or are, or are descended from people who know well the physical sciences but have neglected the social ones, Tsukasa's solution is probably the best one available.",1
455,"Hunter gatherers also concentrate riches in a few. Or did you think that the biggest, strongest or just thr better hunter doesn't get the nicest thing and women?    What civilization does is allow for greater riches and more people. It allows us to stockpile beyond basic necessities. Taukasa wants to force people to be ""equal"" by making them equally poor.",1

They've all been science buddies from the start!     I think this is the only show where I can get really hyped over tungsten filament.       Kaseki gets his walk away high five! High fives for everyone!    Well that got dark.      Gen's song about making batteries was hilarious! xD Also that was totally a Pikotaro reference.    The first OP playing caught me off guard! Love the montage though!    That looks more like a radio tower than an actual cell phone. I'm curious what the actual thing they'll give to Taijuu and Yuzu will look like!      Only 1 episode left! I really hope they'll announce Season 2 next week once the episode is over.,1

In usual anime it's done only a few seconds of training montages, whereas in Dr. Stone they explains every details and it still entertains, the episode flies by and never fells dull.    What I liked in this episode is a few character development here and there like Kaseki or the ex-village chief, hell even I I can't remember his name but still impressed by the little conversation with Senku.",1

484,"I might be missing some things original Jurassic ParkEarly Michael Chricton deserve mentioning, but this show treats science so much better than any  sci-fifantasy TV show or movie I can think of.    It’s not just that the science is largely accurate if simplified.      it’s that it’s decidedly not tony stark waving holographic images around and breaking physics. Or scientists developing and producing  a new and possibly gene editing  super nano-robotvaccine in like 22 hours to miraculously cure a loved one.    The main thing this show emphasizes is that what science though one could argue this show is more a love letter to engineering is; is  basic principles and that lead you through trial and error and eventually after many failures produce results.    That it specifically went out of its way to highlight that scientific research yields secondary advantages is just the icing on the cake.",1
485,"THIS, a million times this    this show has changed how I see science fiction",2
486,"Man, when I started reading this manga as it first started serializing chapter 11 or so I didn't think I would end up loving it so much. And the anime adaptation did such a good job with the OST, the openings, the endings and the animation... It's sad to know it'll end next week, but knowing what's ahead it'd be stupid if they didn't make season 2!    I really love the timelapses, the overall atmosphere reminds me of the time spent with my cousins by the beach...    And the science bits are great too. As a chemical engineering student that picked up this path without knowing what I was getting into, it helps me stay motivated and learn. If you like Dr. Stone and don't know what to do in the future, consider anything realated with chemistry, it can be as fun as it's depicted here! Although a billion times harder.",1
487,The adaptation and OST are excellent but some art and animation on certain episodes are kinda clunky,1
488,Did Kohaku just called her dad a boomer? Were not even a few min in the episode and already she insults him XD,1
489,Well he did treat her like shit for several years and was perfectly willing to let her sister marry an abusive asshole so i say she is entitled to some jabs here and there.,1
490,  WATASHI WA SMARTPHONE GA      Sure does feels like final episode. Is it mistake by the studio to show Homura along with Tsukasa's group since she's supposed to be spying on the Science Kingdom?,1

493,This is one of the best anime for me. Cool way to apply science to an anime. Hoping for season 2 announcement soon.,1
494,Apparently the next issue of Shounen Jump will have a 'major' announcement for Dr. Stone so it could perhaps be as soon as next week.,2

506,The old opening coming on towards the end gave me chills for some reason. Sad af we got 1 more episode this season.,0
507,Making those heaters and getting the children and elderly involved in a way that was both meaningful and satisfying is incredible. Senku learned that inspiration is more valuable than anything.     When Chrome went into the forest and made the waterwheel of his own volition things truly changed because Senku can now hopefully worry a little less that he is being too narrow or getting serious tunnel vision because will others can and will step up because he enabled them.    I love it and he is a better than the village could have ever dreamed of.,1

We are almost done!  Sprint time?  Oh yeah!  Science Montage!!      Magna joining the banter this is nice.  Hes eager to help.      Wait heat the tungsten inside the glass?  Oh shit.

Oh damn a big vaccum pump out of glass.  Thats complicated as hell.      Sharkface is good at getting people to act.  Hes a real smooth talker.      OLDMAN JUST WANTED A HIGH FIVE!? HES SO PRECIOUS       MELONLORD WANTS TO BE USEFUL TOO AND GET A HIGH FIVE!? STOP I CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH!      Plastic, oh damn this will be tricky.  Seems Senku has a plan though.     Oh yeah Senku is cheif now so megane-kun will listen to him, he isnt restricted to guard duty only now!      Of course Senku makes heating for everyone while making his ashes too.  Damn hes a nice guy.      And the old Cheif seems really happy with Senku's actions, thats nice.      Sharkface is making something?  I guess he needs to start being more diverse.      WAIT A SONG!? AHHAHAHHAHAH MY GOD THIS IS HILARIOUS! 800!?  JESUS FUCK!      And now were onto the Mics, the last step!  Leaving Jane to do that?  Risky..      PHONES ARE DONE BABY! AW YEAH MONTAGE TIME!

544,"Science 1010, civilization 110. These people have 0 farms, 0 architecture, 0 economy, 0 institution, 0 government, 0 real military. They dont even have sewage system. They are worse than ancient romans in everything other than science. They really need to revive some modern era human who will do this. This is like maxing only one ability in rpg game. They really need to start progressing as civilization else they will never get to modern era.",1
545,"4 real military, to be fair.",1
546,"They have only about 6 people who can fight with no ranks, base, camps, training for new recruits.",0
547,the main problem seems to be population; they don't have revival fluid.    that or inclusive the fact that they don't have an education system to teach and train people into more productive workers.,0
548,hopefully next episode they win and are able to get revival fluid from the caves. Modern people can teach the stone age people. And rebuild a lot faster depending on what was their past job.,1
549,"how large is their population, anyway?    are they in the 50's?",2
550,idk but they are less than 100 for sure.,1
551,What really got me was when the old chief understood the true power of science when allowed to flourish. Each step allows for a new world of possibilities even if not intentional. Every thing Senku has needed has bettered the lives of the village. This theme started slow on the first episodes but on the last 3 you can really see how the momentum of each discovery building on top of the previous one has catapulted the quality of life of the village.,1
552,Senku the project manager.,2
553,I love all the music the show uses for the montages.,1
554,I hope someone does a compilation video of the montages. Just pure labor,1
555,"If it was so   called  cold outside, why didn't they just bring the wire-making indoors?  Even without indoor heating, just being surrounded by walls would make a large difference.    Nice to see the womenfolk in the stone age preserve the grand old Japanese tradition of going bare-legged in freezing temperatures.    I never knew Kinro ate the Gum Gum fruit.    Good to hear the OP1 song again. So superior to OP2's.    They didn't actually show anything of the stone age version of the ""circuit board"" did they?",1
556,I don't get what you said about them bringing the wires inside. What do you mean?,2
557,"I mean they were freezing their asses and more, more importantly, hands by making the gold wires outside in the cold.  It would've been better to do the work inside even before the chimneys got added.",1
558,"Oh, you meant to say cold. Sorry, I was sleepy and didn't put two and two together.",0
559,"Ah, didn't even realize I'd made that typo.  Happens way too often in recent years.",2
560,"Zinc for seaweed ♪    Manganese rice balls ♪    Coal in the middle ♪    Look at that, a zinc-carbon battery ♪    Look at that, a zinc-carbon battery ♪",2
561,"New phone, who dis?",2
562,Was Gen singing a parody of PPAP pen-pineapple-apple-pen?,2
563,Yiss,2
564,"As great as it was here, I do think that Kaseki's moment when he was told he has friends just worked even better in the manga IMO. Here I felt it was a bit too quickly moved on from, and of course the art can't live up to this",1
565,"Expectation : Smartphone    Reality : Radio    Sure, nobody was expecting them make an actual phone, though it would have made it a bit more reasonable if they stopped using the smartphone image for what they were building...",1
566,"My worry is that so far, all of the sciencey stuff is getting done a little ways away from the village. Certainly, this will be Tsukasa's first target, as it's way more difficult to defend than the rest of the village which can be isolated fortress-style on the islands. Why not move the lab to the chieftain's island? There seems to be plenty of space there since a plaza exists for the succession ritual which can simply take place in another area on the mainland if need be.",0
567,"I wonder what they are going to do with the next episode. There's no way they can put the conclusion to this arc in just 1 chapter, there are a lot of things left that need to happen.",0
568,Maybe it will be the coveted unicorn hour special.,1
569,Yuzuriha and Taiju are in the op but we haven't seen them yet lol,1
570,Did something happen to the english Dub? It was originally 2 weeks behind the Sub but now nothing has come out for several weeks and its now 4 episodes behind and still no update?,0
571,"Last week's episode got delayed due to the holidays, both 20 and 21 are up now, so they're back on schedule. 24 will also be getting delayed a week for the same reason.",0
572,"OHAYO SEKAI, GOOD MORNING WORLD!",1
573,"This episode adapted my absolute favourite scene in the whole manga and I've read literally every chapter available.    Senku leaving everything up to Chrome, and immediately thereafter Chrome saying Kaseki was just as important as either of them and Kaseki's reaction is the masterstroke of this entire story.    There are plenty of interesting parts still to come, but this particular moment in the manga really made me glad I read it.    I've heard some people are going to start reading the manga and I highly recommend it if you've enjoyed the anime so far. No offended to the animation team - the work is undeniably hard - but I don't think it can compare to how Boichi's art goes so high detail in key moments. The moment Senku made light for the first time was something awesome in the manga, while it was really just another scene in the anime, right?    Anyway, hope you all enjoy.",1
574,Ohayou sekai Good Morning World!!!,1
575,I don't know what It is about this show but I really love it.,1
576,"Gen represents the laziest of modern day humans, i love him having to make a song to get himself going through menial work.",1
577,They brought back goodmorning world,2
578,Gens song tho,2
579,"I haven't watched the series at all yet, but is next weeks episode the last one? I'm waiting to binge it all once.     Also is there another season coming out next year?",2
580,10 billion percent chance of a Season 2 announcement next week.,1
581,"No announcement of a second season, but there will be plenty of material left for one, so my bet will be next week they announce like a summerfall season.",1
582,1 more episode left.  They say the 1st arc is a bit weak. Story starts to get wild at episode y and it just gets bettrr and better,2
583,Too bad they couldn’t make guns,0
584,They should at least make some tasersstun guns...,2
585,"Or evacuate the entire village at the end of winter, move FAR away to bumfuck Kyūshū and build the kingdom of science without having to fear an imminent barbarian invasion.",1
586,"Aww everything was awesome until the SENKU PHONE font was shown...    Why did they use that ""machine"" font instead of hand painted one.",1
587,this anime literally makes me cry every single week,0
588,god this was such a good episode,1
589,i will read the manga as soon as the ending credit scene rolls out next week. love this series now,1
590,I suggest you read from the start. The art is amazing.  And there is a certain scene that was skipped,1
591,Kohaku just called her dad a Boomer,2
592,"I'm really excited to see in what way will cellphone help them, and I'm even more excited to see Taiju and Yuzuriha again! This episode has been really fun with Gen's little song I really love Dr Stone's humor and the small little moments, like Senku high-fiving Chrome, Kaseki and Suika these scenes give me life.    Plus Kohaku's dad finally acknowledged Senku as a good village leader, that was sweet. And I love how Senku trusts Chrome enough to let him take over a side project, Kaseki too with the Hickman pump.    Man I'm gonna miss this show after next week.",1
593,Haven't watched this episode yet. But man I will miss this show. It gave me another reason to look forward to the weekends.,0
594,"That was fun. Finally, Senkuu and the Kingdom of Science has acquired the cellphone. I am going to miss this show when it ends, it really is entertaining. Surely there is a second season? I am out of the loop if one has been announced.",1
595,"I am really curious how this show will show that ""phone"" was the best invention to win this battle.",1
596,Can anyone explain why plastic was necessary? Couldn't have they used wooden crates as a casing for that complicated-looking device?,2
597,Plastic is non-conductive,2
598,"From wiki:    Wood is widely regarded as an extremely good insulator, but its resistivity is sensitively dependent on moisture content, with damp wood being a factor of at least 1010 worse insulator than oven-dry.In any case, a sufficiently high voltage – such as that in lightning strikes or some high-tension power lines – can lead to insulation breakdown and electrocution risk even with apparently dry wood.",0
599,"After next week I’m probably gonna have to open up an old science book on Fridays, but it won’t feel the same....",2
600,"Anyone know which song was used during the bro moment with Kaseki, Chrome and Senku?",2
601,I think it would be good to say that the focusing lens actually did nothing because the glass refracted the light a second time,1
602,"It shouldn't. The glass container would have some curve to it, but not as much power as the lens. It might reduce the strength a little, but not enough to kill it. The lens did help, it just wasn't enough given the little light. They might have been able to make a ""solar furnace"" though, an array of lenses and mirrors that would focus a lot of light from multiple directions onto a single point. That would work really well in this case, because each beam passing through the bottle would be relatively weak, and only where they met up in the center would it get super hot.",1
603,This just hit me. Is Senku the singer for the ED?   If so then that makes it sadder :,0
604,"OHAIYOUUU SEKAIII, they brought it back! That was hype as fuck man    Gen, when the album dropping bro?     ;    It's been a looooong journey since this anime was announced back in like May and I kept asking everyone on the CR facebook what it was about and if it was good, really glad I started reading it and got into it, def one of the most unique series I've seen and I'll be sad to see it end next week, hopefully a s2 will come soon, well onto Fire Force.",1
605,I've come to depend on this show for a weekly dose of good feelings. I really don't know what I'm going to do after next week.,1
606,"Besides needing to make a second unit, how would they ever get that second unit to T&Y?  That would take a significant fraction of the work to do a stealth assault. And the unit we saw didn’t seem that portable. And it’s not like Tsukasa and Hyoga would let T&Y be in a position to gather and report intelligence in the first place.",0
607,"Big one is probably a repeater. Smaller field units likely won't be able to pick up each others' signals, so this big on picks them up and retransmits them stronger.",1
608,I take it this season isn't going to have a great ending. Seems like we won't have senku vs shishio team. We'll just have to hope a S2 happens or this will just never happen in the anime.,1
609,"It won't have a  conclusive  ending, but I think the ending will be satisfying.",1
610,Gen's song remind me a lot of Pikotaro songs,2
611,Kohaku and the gorilla joke reminds me of the Love Pillar from demon slayer. The love pillars body type is almost completely equal to Kohakus i feel,1
612,Honestly gen stole the spotlight for this ep like everyone played a part but his song was the most memorable i even uploaded the song so damn catchy lmaoo,0
613,I’ve held on and haven’t read the promised neverland but Dr. Stone is so wholesome it’s gonna be hard not to read after the last episode.,2
614,This episode was so wholesome.,2
615,Can’t wait to see how this all goes down!,2
616,Hhh I finished my Dr. Stone marathon. Senku's laugh is beautiful. Gen best boy. I like how the anime uses gaming terms! I wanna read the manga right now but I will wait until the anime finishes.    YAYY FIRST OPENING INSERT!,1
617,You mean best Girl,1
618,Really going to miss this show,0
619,Man this is such a good episode! That opening song montage was a really nice touch as well. I just know season 2 will get announced soon.,1
620,"Gen’s song was very cringe worthy, but I still kind of liked it lol.    This episode weirdly gave me a slice of life vibe, which was a nice change of pace. I seriously have been loving this current arc.    I’m excited to see the phones in use next episode. Everyone’s reactions are going to be great!",1
621,"I'm starting to feel like it was probably a mistake not to mass produce rifles.  currently the village has 40 people over half of whom are woman, children, and elderly.  In total they can probably field 10-15 people.  The enemy will likely come at them with 100-150 soldiers.  With rifles they could have armed the none combatants bringing their numbers to 40.  There is also the issue of thick tree coverage and the fact that the enemy doesn't need to split up it's forces. I can only see this working out if Senku wants to use this to pass propaganda into the enemy camp.",0
622,"they don't have gunpowder, Senku used the little he had left to bluff Hyoga",2
623,"Unless the enemy side is occupying the spot were Senku was mining the sulfer, it shouldn't be a problem.",0
624,You need the stuff secreted by the bat's crap to make gunpowder If I recall correctly    Only known source is guarded by tuskasa.,0
625,They still lack sufficient nitric acid.,0
626,Actually you can make it using Calcium Nitrate and Sulfuric Acid.,2
627,Sure! If you have some calcium nitrate.,1
628,They don't have enough iron,2
629,"The others are right that they simply don't have the materials to make guns, and more importantly ammunition. But beyond that, swords and communications is far more powerful than guns with no communications.    Senku's group has the ability to clandetinely locate Tsukasa's forces, track them, and radio home with that information. Any intel Tsukasa's scouts acquire has to either be run back, or broadcasted back in a fashion that reveals their location to Senku's side smoke signals, yelling, horns, etc. If Senku's group can locate and eliminate those scouts before they report back, Tsukasa is rendered blind. Even without that, his information travels at a snail's pace compared to Senku's. Imagine trying to play an RTS where everything was fog of war, and you only got map and unit updates--including for your own units--at the rate your units could run back and forth, but your enemy got to see the usual display    As a result, Senku's group has complete control over when and where the battle will take place, and the ability to break up into much smaller groups while maintaining total coordination.     And the villagers are probably more capable warriors than we've seen. We've seen their specialists Kinro, Ginro, Magma, Kohaku, but very likely most of them can toss a spear or something. That combined with absolute battlefield control will win the day.",0
630,"unfortunately I disagree with pretty much everything you said.      - the materials are more feasible to acquire then say, finding tungsten laying on the ground.    - radios are great in large scale combat but not when you only have 5-10 people.  You also seem to under the impression that this is a two way transmitter which it's not. It's only use would be to put it at a high elevation but like I said were talking about a stone world were there are no pastures of fields just thick forests.      - it doesn't really mater how capable you are if your surrounded by 10 people with spears.",1
631,"the anime is titled ""Dr.Stone"" not ""Murder.Stone""",2
632,Try telling that to these guys.,2
633,Rifles wouldn't be too much use without gunpowder.,2
634,"Is it realistic uh, geologically to walk into a cave and find a basketfull of tungsten?",2
635,"Unlikely, not impossible. Skarns like the one shown do sometimes contain tungsten, and  could  form just about anywhere that has or had volcanic activity.",0
636,"Such a great episode, so sad there’s only one more left for a while at least",1
637,Gorilla team so OP they can cook up 1500+ degrees,2
638,The speedrun of preparation with first opening in background was truly remarkable idea,1
639,"Extremely wholesome episode, everyone helped out and did their best for the phone tower.",1
640,"This might actually be the last episode, if the next one turns out to be a recap.",2
641,from the title next episode. I assure you it aint a recap,1
642,The mad lads did it,0
643,I really doubt we'll see the big fight next episode.,0
644,I have no idea how they're going to finish off this season without the final battle.     There's still so much to cover.,2
645,"so wholesome, why must you end?",2
646,"They could have made plastic from milk and vinegar, but maybe that kind of plastic is no good for their scenario",1
647,Where would they get milk in a way appropiate for a shonen manga?,2
648,Oh,2
649,Off-screen Ruri,2
650,Can't watch because our  WiFi is broke,0
651,Build a new one.,2
652,Underrated comment,2
653,"The old couple mentioned people dying in the winter. It’s the first winter for everyone on Team Tsukasa, except for Taiju. How many of them made it?",2
654,"Yeah, maybe not 100%, although they would all be healthy young adults, when most people that would die from a bad winter would be old, very young, or otherwise sickly.",0
655,"Spent the last 2 days catching up just in time for the finale. Old man kaseki touched me this episode, he's a real hero of the town and he just wanted people he could call a buddy",1
656,Can someone please explain wtf gen’s song was? And wtf was he doing making rice balls? This was the first time in the show I didn’t understand what was happening,0
657,"Why didnt he just make a couple of cups and some string, way easier than that monstrosity.",1
658,"Why didn't they just make guns to fight with, or is it to difficult.",0
659,1. Cant make gunpowder 2.Dr.Stone not Kill.Stone,2
