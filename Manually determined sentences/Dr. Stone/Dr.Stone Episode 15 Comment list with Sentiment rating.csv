0,"For those who finally break down and wish to read the manga, this episode covered up to ch. 41.",1
1,And next comes my favorite part ,1
2,      ED plays     T T,1
3,So my predictions of what arc the anime will end seems to have been blown out by the last 2 episodes,2
4,How much of the war can they do in the remaining episodes?,0
5,All of it.,2
6,"Don't you think that might feel a bit rushed though? Thats a good 40 more chapters in 9 episodes. I think we'll end around Ch. 65 with the  ""reappearance of Taiju and Yuzuriha""",1
7,"Frankly not. There is not much to show, to be honest. There are many chapters but not a lot of events. Finishing it on the end of the war is a right idea since you finish the storyline but still leave it opened for a second season. There are already enough chapters out for a 1-cour, so we can have the second season in 2020 or 2021. Dr. Stone is popular as hell, so I don't see it not having a second season, considering that most of the animes from this year got them.     cries in Kaguya-sama ",0
8,"Prior guess from last week and i'm still standing by it.    It's a shounen, many of the panels later on don't take much space in animation form. Rough rate of 4 chapters per episode with 9 episodes this season remaining means 36 more chapters or so will be covered.     ""I'd guess they will end on the conclusion of the stone war arc. Up to Ch. 78.""",0
9,"24? Episodes for 78 chapters is a lot of missing content, would be nice to finish the war but that's pretty fast",1
10,"Close, but Ch 67 seems more fitting. Not only does it neatly wrap up the  ""phone making and telecommunication"" part of the story, but it leaves the following setups for a Season 2:       ""Taiju and Yuzuriha receive the telephone, and Nicky is recruited to help with their ruse""     ""Chrome is captured by the Tsukasa Empire, with viewers curious about Ukyo's nature""     ""Homura is captured by the Ishigami Village""     ""Senku gives the marching order for Ishigami Village to mobilise against Tsukasa""     ""Possible car-making teaser for season end?""    What has me worried though is whether a Season 2 will come. Unlike say Neverland and Kimetsu, Stone's boost for the original manga isn't huge",1
11,I really doubt they'll conclude the war. I'm still wagering they go no further than the Radio arc.,0
12,"I'm alright with being spoiled; Do Ruri and Chrome become a canon couple at some point, or rather will they eventually? Chrome clearly likes Ruri but does she like him? I know Dr Stone doesn't really do romance but I'd like them to end up together at some point. If it does it'll probably be at the end of the manga right?",1
13,"You know. Having thought about your question I can't really remember. Perhaps it was presented for a checkmark, so I just forgot.",2
14,"No, it never actually showed it, I think. They may have said it just before the boat left, but Ruri stayed home and didn't go with the boat, so I haven't seen anything happen between them for a while, so I don't know.",0
15,"Not far enough yet, there's maybe 2.5 arcs after where we are in the anime",2

23,I'm pretty sure that happened in the previous episode.,1
24,"Yeah, it happened last episode.",1
25,My man Senku literally became the first shonen protagonist to marry a girl within the first 20 episodes of a series only to call for a divorce a minute later,2
26,Shonen romance arc speedrun any % new world record,1
27,                          ,2
28,taiju is the embodiment of suffering,0
29,When your luck attribute goes into minus,1
30,"Senku talks like Taiju is big determined but he's big putting it off. C'mon boy, the girl is just waiting for you to say it to jump your bones, what's this talk of bringing back civilization first?",1
31,he didn't confess he was about to when they got petrified,0
32,"After 3700 years, the record was finally broken. Truly a historical moment for the shonen speedrunning community.",0
33,and i feel like this record will remain unrivaled for eternity too.,1
34,"Marriage was illegitimate, he was already married to science.",2
35,     Too bad he is not a harem boy D:,0
36,"     He actually already has a harem. Biology, Chemistry, Astronomy, Geology, Physics, ect.",2
37,Holy fuck those are a ton of girls,0
38,We haven't gotten into the more exotic girls yet.....,2
39,Senku: Yeah I'm in a HAREM.    H- CHemistry    A- Astronomy    R- Geology    E- Physics    M- Biology    STUDY HAREM IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE,1
40,"I think it's a good thing that he is not a harem boy, after all there are too many harems. Not everything needs to be a harem. I'm actually getting tried of the harem thing. I used to like it, but they used this genre too much imo. I prefer it when characters have real relationships.",1
41,"I've been sick of harems since the start, they always seemed like a cheap excuse to avoid conflicts within the group",0
42,I've always hated the ubiquity of harems in anime. A real romance is so much more enjoyable for me.,1
43,Dr. Stone confirmed not Isekai,2
44,"His love for science is illimitable, his marriage was illegitimate.",1
45,Well we all know what kind of girl Senku likes and it's hard to pump oxygen into a furnace when you have pneumonia.,1
46,But Taiju already has Yuzuriha.,2
47,The true love triangle,1
48,Budget NICO NICO looks fine,1
49,Holy shit he would love Kanao from demon slayer.,1
50,"BEGONE THOT, I HAVE SCIENCE TO DO",2
51, Science-chan is his only waifu      datass,2
52,Hmm there's someone at the bottom right.,2
53,It's a YouTuber. Try to guess who. Hint: He's arguably the hardest working one.,0
54,A bit primitive in his ways.,2
55,I just realized: he's basically Senku in the stone age.,2
56,Not even close. Senku is a straight hack in human form for technological progress.,1
57,Early iron age actually nowadays.,2
58,Nah but he'd make a good house flipper in Senku's era.,1
59,bit of harsh too,0
60,Doesn't talk much. Rude.,1
61,"Oh man I've watched one of his videos. Very relaxing, informative, and very Dr. Stone-esque now that we're watching it.",1
62,Uhh so who is it?,2
63,"His channel is Primitive Technology, check it out super cool stuff",1
64,don't forget to turn on Captions!,1
65,Hmmm. Is it Binging With Babish?,2
66,"Oh hey, Navier-Stokes in cylindrical coordinates on the top left.",1
67,"Begone, foul diff-eq!",2
68,Oooh senku and futaba...I SHIP,2
69,"Oh yeah, she  took  that ""powder"", right in the face",1
70,"SCIENCE, BITCH!",0
71,Of course he would.    She had a lung disease.    She can't possibly neither blow nor pump a literal ton of oxygen into a furnace.      I bet Kohaku uses her free time from water hauling to training her lung capacity.,1
72,Is kohaku secretly a Joestar?,2
73,"No, she’s a demon slayer",0
74,That could mean she's also a Hamon user in the Jojo-verse.,2
75,a king,2
76,What a fucking legend,2
77,What about gintoki?,2
78,This cliffhanger really be tempting me to read the manga.,2
79,"If it makes it any better, you only need to wait a week for the answers",1
80,Exactly. I can't give into temptation now.,2
81,Dude that's like 7 days  days ,1
82,But what if tomorrow a mysterious light will spread over the whole planet turning everyone into a stone?,2
83,Then we get to  live  in Dr. Stone!,2
84,But then you won't know what to do past the point where you heal the village priestess,2
85,"Well, not me. I have been reading the manga since before the anime was announced!",1
86,Latest chapter has me pumped,2
87,To be fair I wouldn’t really know how to get to that point.,1
88,I'd probably be shattered in stone form after a few days.,0
89,"""What's the situation?""    ""There lions and shit around us bro""    ""Well,  fuck """,0
90,"Ginro already said what to do, start a harem obviously.",2
91,"that's fine, my level of knowledge for science and everything related is too low.     I probably be a peon and join the kingdom of science instead.",1
92,You think you got enough plot armor in this world to not be one of those statues that a monkey knocks over and shatters?,2
93,"Bitch I'm a scientist.     wears lab coat, swags out ",0
94,And only the manga readers will know the reason why,2
95,"Nah, that would suck",0
96,This is why ive started sleeping in bat guano exclusivley,2
97,"Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.",1
98,I never tought overpreparing could be possible...,2
99,Shinchou Yuusha X Dr. Stone crossover.,2
100,Then you better start counting.,1
101,Well then the rest of the episodes better be out by the time I'm freed.,1
102,"I've come this far and cannot give up like I did with fire force. Good manga though, I recommend it if you like the show.",0
103,168 hours,2
104,"You should hold on, I have a bad habit of immediately searching answers and spoiling plots for myself and I did the same here. wish I didn't though because its too good of a plot to be ruined.",0
105,Playing Devil's advocate here: reading the manga      If you really wanted to read it you shouldn't let the anime stop you from doing it.,0
106,"Yeah but that's an entire week, I don't know if I can wait that long.",1
107,Given the constant cliff hangers im sure we are well past the resistance point for most,1
108,Read from the beggining. The art itself makes it worth it,1
109,I definitely plan to read the manga after the anime finishes airing.,1

111,"I decided to do it several episodes ago and I'm really glad I made that decision. It really is a different experience, and it's interesting seeing how they adapt it. Plus, there's the added bonus of feeling hyped when you know what comes next.",1
112,I’m opposite with anime. I get much less excited when I know what happens next,1
113,"For me, it depends on the series. I'm generally the type of person who  will  look at some spoilers, specifically so I don't waste my time on a low tier story or a decent one that introduces a lazy fan service character or some weird ""Adult grooms child and marries them"" conclusion. Though, that's typically with slice of life or romance dramas, because those are the ones that get messed with the most.    But I typically don't read the manga, because while I do spoil myself on some  general  details, I want to enjoy watching those details get revealed without me knowing when.    With Dr. Stone, I ended up reading the manga because I just didn't want to wait. And while the anime is a faithful adaption from what I can tell, the manga has a totally different feel to it. There are many scenes that almost seem to be copied straight from the manga pages, and yet the voice acting, animation, and sound design all provide something extra that is missing in the manga.",1
114,"That's me with hero aca, been keeping myself away from the manga    But then Google sees that I've watched it and keeps putting articles and yt vids with spoilers from the manga in the title.",1
115,Seriously! I hate youtuber’s complete lack of awareness when spoiling in their titles. That should be enough of a reason to get their videos removed imo.     I now know Deku’s next update to his powers as well as how he survives against this seasons main villain. Very frustrating. But really looking forward to this season nonetheless,0
116,me and the boys hitting the manga like,1
117,"well, if you want, this episode ends with the end of chap 41.",1
118,I think I'm gonna peek ahead just to get the Ishigami explanation. Thanks!,1
119,I gave in to the Manga I had to read the cliffhanger was too strong.,1
120,"I would actually recommend reading the manga. I did it after episode 9 or 10, I don't think you lose a lot because there's no real ""action scenes"" like there are in other Shounen, and the art of the manga is incredible enough to stand on its own.",1
121,The manga is reallllllyyyyyy good btw,1
122,"                  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I'm not even a manga reader, it's just self explanatory",2
123,"I am reading the manga, and it's amazing, I only wish I had enough time to read it more. I haven't even caught up to the anime yet.    I still watch the anime because it's hyping as fuck.",1
124,"Man I know it's probably not true because Senku was conscious the whole time he was stone, but because I'm into lost ancient civilization lately I feel like Senku woke up at some point, did progress humanity but it somehow got lost again and he became stone? Too nutty but regardless I'm really enjoying the Dr.Stone ride!",1
125,"I read it and now can't wait to see it in anime, was the same for this episode",2
126,"If you ever cave and read it don't feel bad about it, the manga's artwork is absolutely fantastic and honestly I think a lot of moments felt more powerful in the manga even without voice acting and music.",1
127,My feelings exactly.,2
128,I'm starting it tonight,2
129,"After reading 1 chapter a few weeks ago i binge read the whole thing, couldn't put it down",2
130,Tfw you gave in 2 episodes ago,2
131,"Same here, unfortunately some ass in the comments spoiled some of it for me",0
132,"Yup, I already started.  Of course I was reading manga volume descriptions to see how far in we were and got a spoiler from it, but oh well.  Still reading!",1
133,"I couldnt resist the temptation. I'm sorry, i swear it was only one chapter, belive me",0
134,Dude literally the trailers for this got me to read the manga when i was intentionally trying to wait lmao,1
135,I did that after episode 1 and it was super worth it.,1
136,"If you ever ever feel like reading it, then it continues on chapter 42, but also recommend watching the anime. Both good",1
137,"Spoiled it for myself, not worth it",0
138,"That cola bottle was such a great moment. Showed Senku still cared and ""officially"" welcomed Gen to the kingdom of science.",1
139,I love how Senku seems like an asshole but is lowkey really nice,1
140,"So, like Dr. House?",1
141,"I think Senku is softer than House. He has a bit of an edge now and then but he's way less emotionally stunted, he  can  show weakness or emotion and isn't much scared of it, it's just that his default mode is ""10 billion % hyped about the next discovery"" and when he's focused on his objectives he doesn't give a fuck about anything else.    Also, his ideology is just more positive than House's. House is pretty cynical. Senku has unwavering belief in science and actually appreciates people; he's not really a ""people person"", but he absolutely knows society needs everyone to function and is not elitist or conceited in the least.",1
142,"Its also a point to note that House's entire cynical persona is a front to protect himself emotionally, although this originally wasn't the case in the first few seasons. In later seasons its shown more and more clearly that house deeply cares about people underneath the cynical persona    It was gradually retconned so that his cynical nature was more of a psychological protection after season 3. It eventually evolved into a physical form around season...6?    Senku and Dr. House are definitely one of the same kind but are definitely not the same kind of character. If that makes sense.       House is more like senku in his s1-3 counterpart. Back when the Idea of house being a dick wasn't just an emotional barrier to protect himself. However house is still a much bigger dick then Senku ever will be. although this is subject to change depending on how the manga turned out But Senku has the mind games and manipulation of house 100%. Just post season 3 house, where he did it more for shits and giggles and to teach lessons.",1
143,"I haven't seen the show in its entirety. however my point is that even though for House cynicism is a bit of a front, the very fact that he  needs  a front makes them different. Senku isn't shy about his emotions. He's very open about his enthusiasm and excitement, for example. He can hide some of the others, but that's mostly because he's a leader in a tough situation and doesn't want to burden or depress his followers, but needs to inspire them. There are occasional times when we get to see between the cracks - like when he's taken by a vertigo upon realising that in 3,000 years precession of equinoxes has moved Polaris - and in those cases he's not afraid to let it show. In other words, Senku is  far  more emotionally healthy than House. He's just not a person with very  common  emotions as he's very focused on his science and whatnot. But when it comes to what he loves, he can get giddy like a little child.",1
144,"The more I try to disagree,the harder it becomes.House & Senku definitely have similarities.However,Senku is nowhere near as cold as House.House also goes out of his way to make sure no one thinks he is a good guy.Senku doesn't really care as long as his motive is fulfilled which usually turns out helping others.And I highly doubt House would've ever made that Cola bottle for Gen.Also,Senku is very forthcoming with his knowledge & he doesn't explain it as ambiguously as Housewhich would be tests for his team He was actually ready to sacrifice himself when they went to that spring.Another thing that House would never do.",1
145,"He was also shown to have significantly less asshole in him whenever his leg is doing better. As someone with chronic nerve pain in one leg, can confirm.",0
146,"     To me, it feels like the opposite. He is significantly more of a people person than other sciencey characters. It is not a high bar but he is very sociable. Even Tsukasa tells him that they would have been friends in other circumstances.     To me, Senku doesn't really comes that tradition of the Western smart characters à la Dr. House and Modern Sherlock. He is Shonen character that is scientist. There are a lot of shonen MC's are very sociable and socially smart. Monkey D. Luffy is the epitome of this but you can see this in a lot of others. Naruto does this as well, although not always perfectly implemented.     Comparing Senku to Dr. House is not valid. The closest character would be Edward Elric.",1
147,"     Well, I mean, he still has some weird moments in which he doesn't take people's feelings in too high a consideration - like the bit where he wanted to mine the Buddha for copper, or just his general lack of care for social convention. But I agree, him being more sociable than most scientist stereotypes was the point.         Good comparison, though Senku is more extreme then again, everyone is in this show's world.     Also, taking a page from Inagaki-sensei's previous work, Senku could be described as a less devious Hiruma.",1
148,"About the social convention, I think it goes back to the Shonen tradition. A lot of Shonen MCs are also pranksters or ignore some social conventions. Remember that Edward was not always serious or respectful.",1
149,"No, but Edward was more conscious of status and the way society worked. Granted, Senku is in a completely different environment, but he seems sometimes straight up oblivious to this stuff.    Not that it doesn't mean if put together they wouldn't get along like a house on fire of course.",0
150,"When you say it like that, I really aspire to be like Senku.",1
151,"What i love most about Senku is though he has exceptional intelligence and maturity that is on par of adults, he's still a kid, and still acts like one to some capacity.",1
152,"Senku is like my favorite High INT character because; despite having a -2 Charisma Modifier he legitimately wishes everyone to be happy, and believes that Science is the road to achieve it. But it's also great how many other people help him on the road to science. Senku has maxed out INT but can't move hearts like Gen, can't fight like Kohaku, can't craft like Kaseki, and every new person added to the Kingdom of Science builds on the list of useful skills that everyone would struggle to live without.",1
153,so he's basically elon musk,2
154,Musk can be pretty prickly though. Remember when he got angry and called a hero diver who rescued a lot of children from a cave a pedo because he dared point out that his mini-submarine idea was actually impractical?,1
155,"Senku is an unshakable optimist who believes in the advancement of humanity.    House is fundamentally a cynic, “Everybody Lies”.",1
156,"Nah, Dr. House doesn't see humans in patients, he sees diseases.    Senku just doesn't care. He loves science. And he loves science because it allows of a lot of cool stuff.    Like cola.    Or Reddit.    So when someone challenges him with something which can be achieved with science, he will do it. That's why he was so happy about Ruri getting better. It wasn't exactly because Ruri got better but because he managed to create a drug to properly cure her.     But I think if he didn't need the village for his needs he still would have made the drug just because he can and the process itself will get him further.",1
157,"But also: Senku loves science  because of humans . Made by humans, for humans. He's not the best at social interaction, but he absolutely makes people the fulcrum of his moral universe.",1
158,Nah House is asshoe.,0
159,Never knew he was Chinese.,2
160,"So, like Dr. Strange?",1
161,Dr. House is not nice by a long shot,0
162,Not even remotely...,2
163,"Oh, is he gonna cook up some Percocet next?",2
164,"No, Dr House is actually an asshole.",0
165,House is a big asshole though.,2
166,House was also a drug addict.,2
167,"Honestly that was really heartwarming moment. Maybe if Gen said something to himself like ""Thank you Senku"" I might've shed a tear :",1
168,I feel like letting actions speak for themselves is what good writing is all about. The audience knows he's thankful to Senku.,1
169,i haven't drank soda in a year for health reasons. i can empathize with how good that cola tasted to Gen,1
170,Good for you hydrohommie,1
171,You could hear him shout hurray in the next scene.,1
172,Eh I don't think Gen is one for sentiment.,2
173,"He needs to win people over with science, so that they will help him. If a cola is what he needs to win over Gen then he will make it.",1
174,True. The soda bottle showed Senku's kindness and I thought it was nice.,1
175,"That bottle of soda was more important than anything  else in this episode. Gen could have potentially forsaken the Kingdom of Science still without it. And with Gen returning, it would mean the death of the world.    Cola  ",0
176,It made me want a bottle of cola really badly ngl,0
177,I expected gen to say it tasted like shit but thanks for trying.,1
178,"This whole time I've been wondering how Senku is going to get around the fact that kola nuts come from South America, and then he makes it out of fucking  cilantro .",0
179,Good thing Gen doesn't have the gene that makes cilantro taste like soap,1
180,Of course Senku cares about keeping his new minion satisfied.,1
181,"Last time Gen was around, it was for Tsukasa to check if Senku survived. Since it takes a while to get over to the village from the original site, what does Tsukasa think Gen is doing now?",1
182,They created 2 bottles and Senku really used one. Really nice how Senku did thought of it.,1
183,T H I C C,2
184,You know you have a good friend when he divorces your crush and she looks like that.,1
185,"ye dude, what a fucking bro",2
186,"Indeed, I would have went full Ginro.",2
187,"Well, to be fair, a woman who lived most of her life with pneumonia wouldn't exactly have the lung-strength to pump a lot of oxygen into a furnace.",1
188,My man,2
189,Look at them hips bruh,2
190,I'd bury my face in that ass,0
191,"If not for stone age hygiene, I would too. She needs to be introduced to Dr. Stone first.",2
192,Dude she's been taking hot baths for years it's aight. She can fart in my face all day,2
193,"As a wise man once said: ""Go fast, eat ass.""",1
194,Those hips don't lie,2
195,Child-bearing,2
196,"I know Suika is a kid, but she is like 1 foot tall in this image.",1
197,shes in the background but yea,2
198,"I was comparing her to Chrome, but 1 foot was hyperbole.",2
199,malnutrition,2
200,can't unsee  now,2
201,So thicc it rips her skirt,2
202,Senku looking like a giraffe in that picture though lol,1
203,"Yea, we all know what Chrome's looking at in that pic",2
204,"It's not hard to see, why 2d  ",1
205,She got hella cake,2
206,   -Cake Acquired!!-   ,2
207,High-key disappointed this isn't a picture of Kaseki.,0
208,rtheratio,2
209,"I'm 99% sure this is referencing Christian art imagery of Jesus.    A lot of religious imagery depicts Christ post-resurrection in a similar pose, with palms facing forward. I think it's meant to show 'hey look I'm Jesus, you can tell by my palms' or 'hey look I'm Jesus, my palms healed up'.    It's fitting with her almost rising from death.",0
210,ginro just went full zenitsu,2
211,Needs more tears,0
212,"Naah, unlike ginro zenitsu can thunderclap your cheeks with his eyes closed",2
213,     ,2
214,       ,2
215,Not annoying enough,1
216,Yea but not enough tears.,1
217,Zenitsu done right.,2
218,But Zenitsu is already done right?,2
219,I mean I think he isn't. Because he literally makes me speed through all the parts where he's awake.,2

329,All hail our lord and saviour Ishigami Senku     edit: change wrong to different cause our boy Ishigami can’t be the wrong Ishigami!,0
330,"Holy shit, I just realized Ishigami means RockStone God, doesn't it?",0
331,I couldn't find any reliable sources for the full name and I don't know how accurate what I came up with is but Ishigami translated into Japanese characters was 石神 and when I looked up each character individually on some kanji list websites the first character 石 means stone and the second character 神 means god. So yeah I guess it would be stone God or God of stone.,1
332,"Usually its written as 石上, but yea its a play on words",1
333,"Actually it might be goddess from my limited knowledge. Whenever words that start with 'K' are change to a ""G"", it's to denote the noun being female. Like Kitsune fox - ",1
334,"It's the ""me"" that denotes the noun being female.    The K to G thing is called rendaku and isn't related to the meaning of the word.",2
335,"Agreed, this is just rendaku. There is no function in Japanese for words to change male to female and most words have no gender. You're thinking of certain romance languages like Spanish where nouns are 'gendered.'",1
336,From what I know kami- ,2
337,"Yes, it literally means ""Stonegod"" one word, i.e. 石神, in Japanese. God is called ""kami"" by itself, as I believe we all know, but when used in a compound word like ""ishigami"" the way it's pronounced might be slightly altered, hence the ""-gami"" in ""Ishigami"". Case in point : ""stone god"" two words -or ""god of stone""- is called ""Ishi no kami""  石の神. ""Rockgod"" ""Iwagami  岩神"" and ""rock god"" ""Iwa no kami  岩の神"" are slightly more remote.     I am not a manga reader so I have no clue why the village is called Ishigami Village or how Ruri could possibly know about Senku and his surname. I can only think three ways that could have been accomplished : Time travel please no... I really,  really  hope they don't go there or Senku was, er, prophesized in the past that he would emerge as the man perhaps as a ""God"" for the ignorant masses that would lead the village and by extension much of the human race forward. That would be an extremely specific prophecy, which would be highly unusual. Or...     The explanation is neither supernatural nor temporal paradox inducing. I would take a very wild guess and speculate that perhaps this village was founded  3700 years ago by  Senku's dad,  who predicted the green petrifying light somehow and took measures to protect himself and a number of people against it. I have no idea why he would leave his own son out of the loop though.. Perhaps he didn't plan to leave him but couldn't get to him in time? Or he predicted no green light but was one of the few people who got lucky and was not petrified, and he founded the original village with these people.    Anyway, my guess is that the ""Ishigami"" name of the village somehow, some way refers to Senku's dad rather than him. His dad told the first ""priestess"" about his son and that knowledge is part of the stories each priestess has passed to the next since the early 21th century. Sorry about the rant :",1
338,"     I'm pretty sure it's because of his father.         Ah yep, we had the same guess.",1
339,"I'm with the dad theory too, but 3.7k years seems too long for a shitty village like that to survive. I'm putting money on it being like a few generations before, tops. It's totally possible that people have been busting out of the rocks by pure luck before Senku.",1
340,"Yes, I think so too.",1
341,Just have to fit with a contest of champions form of Chief replacement. And I can't recall a primitive tribe that did anything close to that. I would think a standard council of Elders would be the result and women would not have been moved to second class status. as much Japan still backwards in this area    At least their is the reason for the topless for woman taboo and that's really sad because traditional Japanese Women Divers for Pearls went topless. Into WWII Japanese Women when called for work went topless and the society really did not have a nudity taboo with mixed sex naked bathing the standard. But forced to censor and follow Western Rules in part the American demanded parts of their new Constitution making more mixed baths banned and the majority seams to think they must enforce a value that it not even theirs. The fact that cultures around the world seam to be compelled to adapt taboo's of the Western Colonial Powers even though they hate the Colonization shows the irrational power of tribalism instinct and taboo instinct. And it shows that most are ignorant of these instincts.,0

You tell the patient to say “E” and if there is fibrosis or fluid in the lung you hear it transmitted as a long “A” sound. They actually transition from Ruri saying E to what Senku hears in the episode which is a cool detail they included. As for sulfa drugs, they aren’t really used to treat pneumonia like they say. Other antibiotic classes are much better for pneumococcus like beta-lactams, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. That being said, they could have gotten a lucky bug that was susceptible to it.",1
409,After 3000 years these could drop their resistance to antibiotics i think?,0
410,Definitely.  I think you just solved the bacteria crisis... just reset the earth for 3000 years,1
411,brb on my way for a nobel prize,1
412,This is a first introduction of Penicillin situation. It will work fantastic at a ton of stuff at first and then they will have to get more specific as time goes.   Senku seams already aware of this with his mention of how difficult a bacterial solution would be. I'm sure Senku also is aware his drug will not remain as kick ass as it was at the start forever. And Senku already mention some types of bacteria infections his drug would be worthless on he was going for the drug that would work on the greatest number of conditions.    And this drug might not be the best even in the stone world with that bacteria after all patient got nasty downturn first. But this drug was the cure the most widest number of things drug not a best drug for her condition because they did not know her condition.,0

416,     We're already working on that part...,2
417,"""It's not them it's us"" solution?",1
418,"Without antibiotics bacteria shift to become resistant to their predators instead, phages.    Which in turn makes them weaker to antibiotics.",0
419,"That's pretty funny and curious, why is that?",1
420,nan,2
421,"It would depend on a couple of things:    1. If there is a fitness cost such as increased energy use in synthesizing it associated with the resistance genewithout any other benefit given the original function is absent, than it will likely be negatively selected for.    2. That state of fungi-if fungi are still around, than many of our most heavily used drugs will still be an active selective pressure. You may change the structure of the resistance proteincompound to more efficiently target fungithus decreasing efficiency against our lab derived drugs, but given the short generation time of bacteria it likely would not be long before resistance is re-acquired.    3.if there are tangential benefits to keeping it around-this may cause the function of the gene to shift significantly but likely from a single amino acid substitution or something similarly simple. If this gene then becomes vital, it would be hard to change back to original resistance genotype. However if gene duplication occurs or plasmid extra chromosomal DNA acquisition happens it can have new gene + original resistance gene.      This is obviously over simplified, but if you want a TL;DR  that synthesizes the 3 points it would be:    1. Due to the fact that fungi exist it is likely that they will be trapped in a red queen situation  with bacteria you would likely still need to use lab work to synthesize “fungi+” ABs before too long.",1
422,"Not medical student, but a method for treating chronic infections is to stop taking treatment drugs, and then hitting the bacteria with a massive dose all at once. The premise is that bacteria in the body do actually lose their resistance to drugs if they're not exposed to them. If this can happen locally over only a few months, it's easy to believe all bacteria would lose their resistance after 3000 years.",0
423,Yea but what I was more getting at is more about how it affects populations and over a generation or twoI.e the problem with thanos solution,0
424,Really makes me amazed just how many different fields of science Senku knows. This guy is practically a walking library.,1
425,"And knowing the recipe for Cola. That's not even science, that's just like random trivia.",1
426,"If he can count consistently for hundreds of years, he can memorize random trivia.",2
427,"I don't think he actually knew the recipe. I'm sure he just had the common knowledge that it is some combo of carbonated water, sweetener, acid, and spices. The hard part is making carbonated water and the rest is just experimenting with basic ingredients. Just like how he devised the makeshift ramen recipe. Cooking is basically just flavorful science.",1
428,"Well, he said he could make Cola, not Coca-Cola. Though I wouldn’t put it past Senku if he had spent a week when he was 9 to reverse-engineer the secret mix.",1
429,"Honestly when Mecha-Senku said what the ingredients were the first thing I thought was, ""Huh, cilantro, lime, and honey. You know that actually checks out.""    Weird how you never think about that kinda stuff until its already laid out for you.",1
430,He’s been in the Coca Cola vault where they have the secret recipe,2
431,Food is science,2
432,"As Senku has said earlier, the process of finding a fungus made antibiotic like the beta-lactams or sporines would be much more up to luck than making sulfonamide, and as far as I know the synthesis of quinolones would be much harder than what they had to do now.",1
433,But penicillin is fairly common right? Just look for blue mold on bread and you're probably good.,1
434,Strong enough penicillin to be medically useful is much more rare in the wild.,1
435,But they have no bread.,0
436,"Sulfa is like the oldest used antibiotic, before even penicillin was used. senku cant jump that far into science and start making fluoroquinolones lol.     Also sulfa kills Gram pos and negs, so it is a excellent old antibiotics. it's crazy  how she live so long with it though!",1
437,I was worried it might have been tuberculosis.,0
438,"Resident here. While you are correct that sulfa antibiotics are not generally used for pneumonia, that is because we are covering for bacteria other than strep pneumo such as anaerobes and gram-negative rods. Strep pneumo, especially given 3000 years to lose any resistances it has, would likely be susceptible to a sulfa antibiotic such as bactrim.",0
439,"Quick question. How could the spring water that Kohaku kept bringing her sister keep the pneumonia at bay? Wouldn't the bacteria either build a resistance to it, or die off?    I had pneumonia before. It's not fun. I ended up getting it during an uncommon season, so it was interesting to see the nurse and doctor gear up in some additional PPE basically similar gear to what Senku had when dissecting the rat, because before the tests came back, they were thinking it might be whooping cough.",0
440,"Yeah that part of things you just have to suspend belief. There’s a lot pretty wrong with it. Like for instance hemoptysis isn’t a common symptom of pneumonia, I don’t know of anyone who’s just living with pneumonia for years. Untreated you die or you get better by yourself in a few months tops. The spring water stuff doesn’t really make any sense for somehow preventing it from killing her. Medically there’s a bunch of problems but ya just gotta believe lol",1
441,It could be as simple as a placebo effect helping her. Or there were dissolved minerals that helped her immune system. A lot of tribal and extremely rural people are very iron deficient.,1
442,"I figured that it wasn't something that actively hindered the bacteria, but rather something that helped the body fend for itself and slow down the process, similar to resting and drinking lots of fluids for the flu.",0
443,"you can treat pneumonia with sulfamide, we don't do that because we have better options, they didn't",1
444,"only thing i am wondering is, ruri was sick for a long time now, and the pneumonia was as kinda stated in the lungs. The fact that nobody else in the village got infected, is practically impossible right?",0
445,"You could kinda hand wave that as her having a position if respect and authority in the village, which limited her exposure to everyone else. The only ones we really see Ruri interact with are her immediate family, Chrome, and those two adviserguard folks.    It's a bit of a flimsy excuse, but it's something.",1
446,"Also pretty sure that you can't have pneumonia for that long. My bet was that she had Cystic Fibrosis which is would present the same symptoms including hemoptysis coughing up blood. More prevalent in caucasians too. However, pneumonia is actually curable while CF is not at this time.",1
447,It could have also been tuberculosis. But luckily it wasn't.,1
448,"Also, it was pretty much their only shot. Making those other antibiotics probably would have been far more complicated.",1
449,7 days late to the party but is the science in this show even remotely credible at all? Like can you really make the medicine using this method???,1
450,Can’t comment on manufacturing drugs. I’d think it’s credible the actual materials used to make stuff but what’s really unbelievable is how they’re able to just stumble upon all of these things in nature. That and some of the methods used were pretty hand wavy,1
451,Suika is the cutest damn character and must be protected,1

455,"Man, Yuusuke Kobayashi is just absolutely killing it as Senku. It’s honestly crazy how synonymous his voice has become with Senku’s character. I really hope a S2 gets green-lit after this, as Dr. Stone is easily the best running series in Jump right now. Can’t wait for next week!",1
456,His VA skil level up pronouncing Para acetomidobenzesulfonic acid,2
457,     ok but actually I'm wondering how many takes it took the VA to pronounce them all perfectly,1
458,"Chemicals aren't hard to say, or even really that long.     Well, they're long, but it's because the long names for chemicals are stitched together with what elementscompounds made them, as well as some general prefixes and suffixes.    That makes it easier to look at how to pronounce each syllable and how to put each syllable together.",1
459,"As someone who had to make a sulfa drug and present my findings for my Chem Minor, I can only relate.",2
460,My guess is that they did a bunch of takes and then stitched together the best parts in post.,1
461,Compound words are not that hard.,1
462,"Especially in Japanese, which already is syllabic.",2
463,There's One Piece. But for me Dr. Stone still takes the no. 2 spot in an extremely competitive jump lineup.,0
464,Last week i just couldn't take it anymore and ended up reading the entire Dr.Stone manga. Oda is a genius when it comes to story telling and One piece is amazing and all that but i am left simply in awe about how much time effort and dedication it would go in one Dr.Stone chapter. I mean you need some scientific scenario which you can't just get factually wrong and then you have to somehow integrate them into the story in such a way that it would look fun and interesting and you just need to keep coming up with more interesting stuff and taking scientific stuff and story telling side by side it's kind of mind blowing.,1
465,"BTW, if you want this ratchet up one level, you can read Release That Witch, it is even better at this industrialization story.",1
466,But china,2
467,"Although when it's all said and done I prefer One Piece, reading Dr. Stone weekly is a lot more fun.",1
468,Agreed whenever the new chapters of WSJ are out the first thing i check are One Piece and MHA. But i just really appreciate how much effort it would go to make Dr.Stone.,1

575,All this time Senku was O U R G U Y !?     Jokes aside I'm honestly surprised how Senku finally diagnosed Ruri's sickness as Pneumonia just from her coughing so bad + knowing there is some bacteria that also infects mice.,1
576,"He didn't base it just off that. He based it off the fact she tested positive for Egophony which is a tell tale sign of pneumonia since it basically always comes with pleural effusion and build up fluids in the lungs.    Plus he saw in the rat that its lungs were inflamed, which is exactly what Pneumonia is -- ",1
577,do rats not get TB? tb often has fluid as well,1
578,"I mean, that was the point. He didn't know for sure what it was until he saw how it was reacting to the antibiotics.",0
579,"I actually thought it was Tuberculosis when I saw Ruri cough blood and given her other symptoms even Senku came to think it might be and I was like ""oh no, I can't go through this again"".",1

594,"Hope you like bloodletting!  That was their cure for everything.    Pneumonia?  Clearly you have too much blood!    Headaches?  Too much blood!    Hypertension?  Too much blood! ...though, completely by accident, this was the one condition where bloodletting actually eased the symptoms a little bit    Syphillis?  Bloodletting won't work here... what you need is some mercury poured into your urethra!    ...it... it' cannot be understated how abjectly horrifying medicine was until basically a century ago.",1
595,There are a constant number of people at blood donation fixed sites who are there to have blood removed for Medical Reasons. I recall many need blood removed as they had to much Iron in their blood. If I recall right in many cases the blood could not be used as donor blood.

604,"The mafia is really dark and sketchy, but antivaxxer logic is like saying that since there are mafia who use a pizzeria as a front to launder money, then pizza is bad.    Of all the sketchy things pharmaceutical companies can do, vaccines are not one. They're old stuff, tested for decades, well known, well understood, there's pretty much no room for shadiness. If they're going to do something shady it's going to be something like selling a new medicine which passed with botched testing or fraudulent research because they want to make as much money as possible before the patent expires. And it's probably going to be something way more lucrative than a freaking vaccine.",0
605,Tfw modern people reject science...,0
606,"Damn cliffhanger, but I'm glad Ruri is all better.    It would've been annoying if she had another disease that their drug wouldn't have been able to cure.    Kinda mindblowing just how bad pneumonia was back in the day, and nowadays we just call a day off work, take medicine and we're all good.",1
607,"     Nah, it's still pretty bad, and actually can kill if you're weakened child, old, immunocompromised or, God forbid, your infection is antibiotic-resistant. I had it when I was 3, not even pneumonia yet, just a beginning, and my doctor had me blasted with multiple injections of antibiotic. Basically the ""nuke it from orbit"" approach. It's the only way to be sure.",0
608,Yes. That's why you don't stop taking antibiotics even if you are feeling fine. You need to kill them all completely because if something is left it might grow back and being resistant to the drug you just took.,2
609,"Yup, precisely.    That's also why sadly we're likely to see more people dying of pneumonia in our lifetime, because the fuckers are adapting  fast , some are now pretty much immune to all our antibiotics, and we're playing catch up. So unless we can come up with some really ingenious new scientific solutions, we might see a return of the days in which an infection could easily spell death.",0
610,Luckily bacteria might start losing resistance over time if certain antibiotics stop being used for a long time,1
611,"I heard that they're working on getting into a rotation to where they give drugs A, B, C, D, and by the time the bacteria are resistant to D, their A resistance will have faded, so we'll always have something that works.",2
612,Still no where close to the level of control and regulation of antibiotics we need but control is getting better.  Also this was a area of low profit to the drug companies for awhile so the money in researching new was not there. A great deal more money is in the field now.,2
613,"Also, we should just stop using them in crowded factory farms, full stop. Just another reason to kick down our production of meat in addition to climate change.",0
614,until we invent nanobots that can just disassemble them manually lol,1
615,"I mean... you just described the immune system, basically. Antibiotics give us an edge, but it's insane how much our immune system can already do. Also, bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect and disassemble bacteria. And they were tried as therapy too, in fact I think they're being re-evaluated now. But they're much harder to administer than simple chemical antibiotics.",2
616,"It's mega expensive and a personalized medicine, so unfortunately no way to generalize it. Damn.",0
617,Well there  is  always bacteriophages,1
618,"Phage therapy has been attempted in the past, and ditched because antibiotics were much easier and more efficient. I think someone's looking into it again, but it's kind of a crapshoot.",1
619,"     I mean, old people die from it all the time so not really that simple.",0
620,See they were already off work permanently and thats part of the healing process. The joy of not having to go to work the next day does wonders for the body. They didnt get that joy because they had no work to be off of,1
621,Please tell that my body. Often the first day of my vacation I'll feel terrible because my body thinks it can rest now and I get sick,0
622,They probably die because they don't go to the doctor immediately and wait until they end up in the ER.,0
623,I seem to recall reading that pneumonia is the proximate cause of death for a lot of other conditions. Like cancer doesn’t kill you per se you just end up such a wreck you can’t fight off pneumonia anymore.,0
624,"It’s also very frequently an opportunistic pathogen that will co-infect a person during a different infection, which may resolve while leaving the pneumonia to finish off the now energy depletedimmune system ravaged person.",1
625,"To be fair, old people die much more easily in general, sadly.",0
626,"Yeah but old people die from practically anything, it's kind of their main skill.",0
627,"Old people die from falling off a step that's less than a foot tall. As we get older we get weaker, so they down count.",0
628,"     I thought the cliff hanger would be before the cure. When they were talking about ""what if it's a bacteria our drug can't handle"" I was sure her coughing fit would be the cliffhanger.",1
629,"Jim Henson died of pneumonia. I had walking pneumonia when I was in highschool. Got misdiagnosed by a doctor. It got so bad I had coughing fits from just walking to my next class. For months I was sick with it getting slowly worse. Finally went to a different doctor who couldn't believe I was functional. It took me several more months to recover. Friend of mine caught it a few years ago. Thought she had a minor cold but a day later ended up coughing up blood and had to be in the hospital for a week. It is not a ""take a day off work"" sickness.",0
630,"Jesus. My bout with pneumonia wasn't fun, but I wasn't coughing up blood. I was homebound for a little over a week I only got up to go to the bathroom. I couldn't walk much because my coughing fits made me light headed. Thankfully I was on anti-bodics pretty quickly",1
631,     Its an alternative possibility that would have made sense and been 100% fine.     If it wasn't a Shoenen this would have been the outcome. That being said Dr. Stone likes to stick to giving the illusion of alternative choices. Which is nice considering most Shoenen don't do this.,1
632,Pnemonia was quite likely from the description Chrome and Kohaku gave.,2
633,"My grandpa fell and died a few days later very unexpectedly from it , he was 89.",0
634,"in the ""ancient"" time, peoples like the Azteks and Maya's died just from an simple ""cold flue"" virus for us",0
635,A couple of my co workers have died from pneumonoa and one almost died because 2 doctors misdiagnosed her.,0
636,"...wow. May I ask what job is it you do? Is it something where this could be considered a work hazard like, you're exposed for long times to coldhumidity, you work in environments with dusty or otherwise polluted air, etc.? This doesn't seem normal for healthy working age adults in this day and age.",1
637,Makes me wonder what would happen if the villagers contact a viral disease such as influenza since antibiotics won't work against them.,2
638,Good part is Human specializations stuff will have gone away except in people you wake up.   Once Science Rules all everyone being recovered should be quarantined and screened totally to try to keep many things from being reintroduced.,1
639,"You can still do a lot simply if you can provide better food, warmer houses, etc. Of course it'll take some time but a lot of our higher survival rates compared to the past is simply due to not having our immune system reduced to shit by strenuous living conditions.",0

643,"Yep, 24 episodes total.",1

645,I need a full adaptation of everything amazing,1
646,do it.    come to the source side,2
647,Having read since the very beginning it’s even more enjoyable watching when you know what’s going to happen.,1
648,"Im the opposite. I dont like to know how tuongs end when i watch movies or shows. The suspense is killed for me and i lose that ""in the moment"" feel.",0
649,"I happened to read the manga before the anime started, so I'm in the camp that doesn't get to wait. I love both, honestly. This episode was SUCH a huge payoff. I'm thinking we have two more major arcs to go... one slightly shorter and then a longer one that'll probably end the season. There is LOTS more awesome stuff after that.",1
650,No. I say you watch the next 2 episodes first then you jump in the manga.,0
651," woo    That was so good, even got me a bit teary-eyed there.     comfy    BUT THEN THEY GOTTA LEAVE US WITH THAT CLIFFHANGER!!!     WRYYY",1
652,It's okay babe,1
653,"Exactly my reaction. Felt really good to see finally the payoff after so many steps and also raises the appretiation for all the everyday stuff we get so easily but are actually frigging complicated to make. And then, when all that science and hard work actually leads to improving lives, like with the glasses or the sulfa drugs, that's getting me teary.",1
654,"I really liked the fact that they skipped large parts of the antibiotics preparation, this give the episode time to progress beyond this point. It took long to get here but in the end they didn `t take an unnecessary amount of time and appropriately rushed to the result.",1
655,I don't think they skipped any.,2
656,yeah even pulled in flashbacks so the episode ends up with 24 m,1
657,was the autopsy of the rat cut somehow? felt like there were some parts missing,0
658,I'm not a manga  reader but he did slide open a rat's stomach.,2
659,like a zipper but permanent,1
660,"Yeah but they didn't overdo it, taking too much time explaining each ingredient and procedure.  While interesting this is still an anime and having a good pace is very important",1
661,"     But if I ever wake up in a stone world, how will I now know how to make precious antibiotics?",1
662,"Honestly, when this happened in the Manga I got super worried, it had been basically ""science of the week"" up to that point, so when they felt like they were rushing that road map along like that it felt like it was in danger of getting canceled so they were shifting the flow of the story a bit in an attempt to get their rankings up",1
663," ;    SCIENCE WON, LET'S GO.    Chrome, you had one job.    I love how Senku went trough the trouble of making the coke for gen that Gen realized that coke was better than his  life-dream personal harem.",1
664,     Senku is a man of his word.,2
665,Complete with cola bottle and branding,2
666,"Well, the ""frail"" old man probably made the bottle.",1
667,"Senku-Cola, the taste of a   New   Stone Age",2
668,Not mutually exclusive goals. Hes just going to have to work harder for it now.,0
669,"I’m not a cola drinker, last time that I finished a whole bottle is probably 5 years ago, but I do have few sips here and there per year.    Last night I had pizza for dinner and saw my partner’s can of coke, and decide to take a sip. Boy, that fizzy feeling down your oily throat was amazing.    I’m still not craving for it, but if I ever want a reminder of civilization or technical advancement, then cola is on top my of list.",1
670,"I kinda view it like Tony Stark wanting a burger. Gen wanted that cola when reality hit him harder than it ever could, the world he knew was gone, and he was almost certain to die a pretty shitty death, and much sooner than he had ever considered before in his life. He just wanted to go home, or at least have something to make him feel like he was there even for a minute",0
671,"Cola is best when you don't drink it a lot    Id probably be like gen in the stone world, after not having a cola for that long it must taste divine",1
672,Tbf I think in the manga they said Chrome used the last of his strength to throw the glasses of science to Senku. Science bro  ,1
673,     He  did  play the biggest role by far in getting Team Science through the tournament though. Too bad for him that he couldn’t stay conscious for a few more minutes to fully claim the fruits of his labor.,0
674,They did it. They actually did it. Ruri has been saved and Senku is village chief... of a village with his last name. It feels nice that Gen was able to get his cola too.    So now I wonder how the village will prosper and develop under Senku's rule. Will they expand the territory and try to create more technological advancements?,1
675,"Well, steel weapons is probably the first thing we expect, since the OP has both Kin and Gin with what look like Katanas. Firearms would be next, since Senku needs military strength with Tsukasa still being a threat.    I think the next few episodes will probably jump back to Taiju and Yuzu, while we get a timeskip on Senku's side of the story.",1
676,"There's not that much point getting swords as well as guns though. They appear to all use spears so sword training would be a waste of time, and it's not that much more difficult to create a gun instead of a sword - especially since they already have gunpowder and you only need a little training to use a gun.",0
677,Just enough skill points to unlock the firearm branch after maxing out the medicine tree,2
678,"They don't have gunpowder though. They need nitric acid for that, the only source of which is currently under the control of Tsukasa.",2
679,I'm sure they can find more bats somewhere.,1
680,"I mean, it was already a chance in a million right? I doubt they'll just stumble across more bats in the same configuration dripping nitric acid from a cave roof...",0
681,"Not that low of a chance really. Bats aren't uncommon, they just need to find a cave and scoop up the guano. You can also create it from manure and urine, although that's a more time-consuming method.     It's also technically potassium nitrate they need, not nitric acid.",1
682,"If I were senku I would speedrun the guns back, it was established early on that senku knew how to make them and that Tsukasa would be no match for them.",0
683,"Hmm, a timeskip this early into the show would be pretty interesting. Usually we get a timeskip later down the line. But weapons doesn't seem like a bad idea to go for now.",1
684,"I don't mean a timeskip of a few years or anything. Just a few months for Senku to get established, otherwise we'll basically be repeating the last 6-7 episodes over again.",2
685,Tsukasa gets there & is welcomed by a battalion of armored tanks.,1
686,Senku is a fan of making his own Abrams division.,1
687,First Gulf War very brave idiot try to use RPG vs Abrams while forgetting you don't try to do that from the front at the same level. They used the main Gun 120mm Gun on him instead of the coaxial machine Gun.   They said he went everywhere.    Edit to Add  met Vietnam War Tanker he said using Canster a really huge shotgun shell when they were close would only leave sandals behind.,0
688,"That's pretty brutal. Stupid on that guy's part, but brutal nonetheless.",0
689,"All I got from all that jargon is that some people were filled with more holes than a fine Swiss cheese, right?",1
690,"Not quite. A 120mm round is essentially a really big long bullet fired out the main gun of a tank. It's designed to penetrate thick metal armour, so what happens if you use it on a soft squishy bag of flesh? You basically explode.    Canister shot is basically a shotgun shell on steroids. The sheer amount of metal balls hitting you would shred you into little pieces.",0
691,So more like shredded cheddar than Swiss cheese?,1
692,"More like minced beef, but more chunky",1
693,"You joke, but........",1
694,He's definitely acquired the manpower of the entire village so they can probably do bigger projects now,1
695,"He'll certainly have more helping hands, but I guess it's a question of where to divert resources and manpower into.",1
696,"My thinking is more ""who is Senku going to dump all his leadership duties on so he can spend more time on science.""",0
697,"Chrome would be the most reasonable, but he would want Chrome to help him with more experiments.    Maybe he would just leave Ruri in charge.",1
698,Shit is going to get even better.,0
699,that divorce is the ultimate power move,2
700,Smart too. Otherwise he would have to split up his assets after building up the kingdom of science.,1

703,"i need that Suika tripping compilation whenever season 1's done, i can watch that for an eternity.",2
704,Of course! ,2
705,"Ruri     keep it PG, you're feeding the doujins",2
706,PG...Pretty Good..,2
707,they just write themselves,2
708,"I'm consistently impressed with how well this series justifies every detail. I remember thinking it was a funny little oversight that they called Kohaku a gorilla, but then they called back to it later and it looks like we'll get a full explanation soon I'm guessing Senku's dad was the one who made the first de-petrifier for this village?. And now we learn that even Kohaku's daily hot spring deliveries were relevant. It seems like the author really planned ahead.",1
709,Author does excellent characters,1
710,Suika tripping cause doesnt have the melon glasses,2
711,Senku's such a tsundere. He gave Gen the impression that he wasn't making cola only to surprise him.,1
712,"Alright bois.. let's get a stitch of that one scene. You know the one.    EDIT: Someone already made it. That was quick :P    As for the ep itself, having the village named after him is either coincidence or someone in his family founded it. Either way, can't wait to find out!",1
713,  ,2
714,"Ramdom thought: Perhaps the name title is ""Dr. Stone"" cause they are also trying to say that 'Science Rocks!'.",2
715,They already explained that Dr. Stone refers to the healing factor associated with petrification tho,2
716,"Actually the meaning of the title mutates with the plot. It can refer to Senku being a scientist in the stone world, to the sulfa drug, or to the petrification's healing abilities.",1
717,or soap!,2
718,Yes soap too!,1
719,"Nah, I prefer rest.",0
720,Or just soap,2
721,"As someone earlier pointed out, it also likely refers to the fact that Senku's family name is 'Ishigami' which basically just means 'stone god'",1
722,"I saw that comment, but IDK if god is really a good connection to make.",1
723,"I know, that's why it's ramdom XD",1
724,When some outsider takes your job and curves your supermodel daughter like it's nothing,1

726,"Did not expect that twist at the end, happy to see Ruri finally saved!!     faito",1
727,"It was sort of teased either last episode or the episode before. But ruri was talking with senku, and as she didn’t know his name, she asked, and once told, got all surprised. She was about to mention the stone people, but got all choked up from coughing",0
728,"Well we all knew there was gonna end up being one last wretch in the cogs of the grand bout didn't we. Well anyways Senku, mazel tov I guess.      Oh yeah, Gen never did see Kaseki's raging pectorals did he.      Mecha-Senku! With his awesome exposition powers.      That ""say eee"" part was good for a laugh. And I needed one today.      But anyways looks like next episode we may get some answers to some long burning questions about this village.",1
729,I wonder what would Senku do next if it was indeed a Tuberculosis infection?,2
730,"Watch her die, there are like 4 different drugs needed to treat TB. Her time was essentially up.",1
731,"Ruri: ""Guess I'll die""",0
732,"I was thinking it couldn't be TB, because isn't it highly contagious, so by this time, damn near 23rds of the villiage would have been infected? At least one other person would have caught it by now and show symptoms.",0
733,"I’m not so sure, the priestesses isle seems to be mostly avoided by the villagers and only those on official business go to it. We already see that’s it’s contagious with both the dead rat and the sk00ky rat. I think the fact that it didn’t spread is either a miracle or something to do with the more mature adult immune systems of the priestess’ attendants.",0
734,"It's not  that  contagious, and again, it attacks more easily immune compromised people. TB has been endemic for centuries in Europe but never exploded in massive epidemics like the plague or cholera, that I know of.    Also: TB is a farming disease! It comes originally from cows. Since these guys don't seem to be raising cattle, it would have been less likely for them to have it.",1
735,Game over. Villagers would most likely execute senku when Ruri ends up dying since she probably had days left. Not sure how kohaku or anyone else would feel about it so it might just happen.,0
736,"Kohaku would never let that happen, she is the strongest in the village after all. She knew that success wasn’t guaranteed after all.",1
737,"I was like ""oh god I can't go through this again"" when Senku mentioned it might be Tuberculosis.",1
738,Boah,2
739,"he would live to tell Chrome,""I watched Ruri die.""",2
740,"   Stitches Time!!

Well that's one way to take your medicine.    Bless Boichi.    I'm impressed Ruri even survived this long with Pneumonia!     Ruri going fast! I wonder if she's also as strong as Kohaku.    WHAT!? HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE!? Now I'm more tempted to read the manga!",1
741,     I hope not because it would be weird. She's been sick and weak for so long.,0
742,she definitely is thiccer than her for seating around the whole day,1
743,Mostly fat I would assume,2
744,     I did that and it was awesome,1
745,Could you by any chance link the Senku fist pump scene please? That scene was cool af! Thanks.,1
746,"""Cured Ruri"" could be a poster. I'm half-tempted to make it one.",2
747,"     I haven't read the manga, but I'm guessing his dad or a relative of his founded the village.",2
748,"Don't read the spoiler if you don't want to know the reason why:  ""you're correct!""    Automod also killed the version of this comment with the new-style spoiler. :",0
749,     What baffles me is how did that not come up in 6 months in show time?,2
750,"Damn, I had goosebumps when he realised that the village was called Ishigami, even though I didn't know that was his family name at the time. Then the goosebumps got stronger when Ruri confirmed his name, and the goosebumps turned into tears when the ending song started. Judging by the ending, the village probably had something to do with his father right?",0
751,working headcannon right now haven't read manga yet: His father woke up 1-200 years earlier and founded the village with others who were also gradually freed and the current villagers are his decedents.    mostly basing this off the new visuals in the OP and ED and the fact that their Priestess story tellerhistorian knew his name on hearing it.,1
752,Would explain why his name was passed down in their lore somehow too. Somebody setting the place up for Senku's eventual arrival.,2
753,Senku better pull some political move to get Ruri to marry Chrome instead or we riot,0
754,well she is single again since Senku went for the quickest divorce record,1
755,We already know from the first episode that Senkuu isn't one to help with stuff like that. Up to Chrome to go ask himself.,1
756,"Well he is willing to help, as proven by this episode. He fully intended to throw the match to Chrome so he could marry Ruri, and also put effort into not letting Ginro win which if he really didn't care, would have been fine.",0
757,It’s funny how they will likely forgive Ginro quite quickly when in real life Chrome would see Ginro’s actions for the huge friendship-ending backstab it is.,1
758,"Ginro isn't malicious, just a massive idiot",0
759,13yr old me would do the same thing,2
760,"Lowkey I thought senku was gonna be like ""Okay first rule as Chief, Ruri go marry chrome instead.""",1
761,"     Me: ""Wait doesn't anime do that thing where it says something suspenseful and then ends the episode     Episode ends     Me: ""SHIT""",2
762,Ginro is so funny especially his scummy face and attitude     That marriage and divorce sure was quick LOL    The chemicals in the sulfa drug are tongue twisters haha    Senku's so badass with his diagnosis and autopsy    The ending is such a cliffhanger. I wonder how this turns out.    Looking forward for the next week's episode :,1
763,     It's fun and silly until someone like that actually gets made the leader.  I guess spiteful people still have fun watching afterward,1
764,Damn straight. How is the village named after him? Ruri-chan must have named it.,0
765,Yeah I'm curious as well. I'm so excited for next week's revelation :,1
766,Goddamn Ruri. Could this scene be any more blatant? :D,1
767,"Yeah... that scene was fine for the manga I guess, but I wished they would do something different for the anime which is supposed to appeal to a broader audience.",1
768,"what why?? This does appeal to ""broader"" audience !",2
769,Ruri's medical bill: her whole village,2
770,So she's on an American healthcare plan then. . .,2
771,So the village is name Ishigami and the stories of old mentioned Senku? I guess that his father was the founder of that village.,2
772,"Ohhh, that makes sense given how he is in the ED!",2
773,good thing he hasn't gotten romantic with Ruri or Kohaku yet they may be blood related... but then again that's so Japan,1
774,Oh shit. So Senku is like Ruri and Kohaku's great-great-great-great-great-great...-great-uncle.,0
775,Ishigami village is Alabama confirmed.,2
776,"I mean, they are a village of population 40. By this point, they must be inbred as fuck...",2
777,Preeeeetty sure the DNAgene pools will get super diluted after 3000+ years. And second cousins with no time gap is already considered far enough,1
778,The village is only a few generations old right? 200 years or so,2
779,"That's still more distantly related than someone like a second cousin, who is genetically distant enough that plenty of cultures consider them marriable.",1
780,Consider the current culture is fine with people who have a 50 percent chance of giving their offspring a lifetime disabling condition if they have children. The risk of major problems with incest of one generation even at the family level is way way lower than that. I have seen 3 to 6 percent with siblings and not that much higher parent to child. Thus we have lost any logical reason to forbid those marriages if they are adults when they do it.   It's many generations of inbreading where the chances of problems get higher and then certain as the inbreeding continues to extinction. That excusing people who all ready have genetic disorders then it quickly goes to 50 percent or even higher.     Note Cleopatra the VII the famous one was a product of many brother sister and one Grandfather to Granddaughter marriage. Incest increases the chance of positive traits being increased as well.    Incest is how the German Shepard was created using the old dispose of defective puppies and keep the good looking puppies system.,1
781,Yeah.,1
782,It’s still 10 generations,2
783,Most people are only 7-10 generations related.     Less 5-8 if both partners are from the same geographical region.,2
784,Nope,2
785,We don't really know at this point.,2
786,Completely missed that,0
787,Spoiler.,2
788,I'm 90% sure this was already revealed in a flashback scene in an earlier episode,1
789,"I don't think so. But if you find such a reference, point me to it please.",1
790,It wouldn't matter after 3.7k years.,2
791,"If that's the case then perhaps Senku's father dragged him, and his friend over to the caves, knowing that eventually the bat urine would thaw him out.",1
792,If this is going the way I think it's going then I expect some feels coming.,2
793,It would make sense if they inherited all these stories that we end up with Momotarou of the North Star accompanied by a ton of monsters.,2
794,     I wonder if they had some part to play in the stone event happening in the first place.,1
795,"This episode was multiple layers of fantastic. I mentioned on a previous episode's thread that I wouldn't mind it if Senku somehow   sorcerer'd   science'd his way to victory, and the mad lad did just that, well, sort of. The entire cascade of exchanges after that had me rolling.    The entire scene of them creating the sulfa drug was incredibly satisfying, the payoff to all their hard work and effort so far, the culmination of two million years of human progress. And Gen walking into that room and seeing the bottle of Cola had me grinning as if I was the one who got it; so satisfying.     Senku kneeling had me scared for a bit, it seemed desperate, like it's a lost cause, but then he goes ""we won"". I got got.     Then they drop the village namelast name thing and I'm still incredibly curious. I actually found out Senku's last name a while ago but had no idea what it meant and why it was under a spoiler tag, so when they dropped the village name it was like ""oh... ohhh!"" for me.    This show is just so incredibly fun. I haven't enjoyed something like I'm enjoying it in a good while. It's exhilarating, simple as that. Can't wait to see where it goes now.    As an aside, the new OP's visuals are astounding.",1
796,WTF YOU CAN'T END IT THERE,0
797,Yes they can.,1
798,That Ashita no Joe reference was subtle as fuck,0
799,Senku's marriage lasted 1 minute 29 seconds. What a madman.,2
800,Bad ruri stitch    Anyone better at doing these able to do it better for us all?,1
801,What is a stitch?,2
802,"It's where you take multiple frames from a panning shot, and ""stitch"" them together into one image. Usually done so you can see the whole art, like I've done.",1
803,uLeonKevlar always makes a bunch of great ones if you ever want to see them. I always scroll down far enough to see the stitches of theirs before closing the tab.,1
804,Such a satisfying episode,1
805,"The old ripped dude was hilarious in this one    ""Go,me.You can fall in love with me if you want,girls.""    Senku shows some admiration for the bamboo spinner.    ""Senku,you don't need to fall in love with me""    had me rolling.",1
806,"One episode of an average shonen adaptation: the hero squares off with the villain, they throw taunts at each other, start their first bout.    One episode of Dr. Stone: two matches of a tournament, the hero wins the tournament, the hero marries, the hero divorces, the hero creates a cure for an illness, the hero cures that illness in his ex wife, and we find out about a mysterious connection between the hero's past and the wife's village.",1
807,Senku speedrun,2
808,"This is the most satisfying and strongest episode of the entire series thus far. From start to finish, there's one rewarding moment after another, and it managed to be consistently entertaining, while also incorporating comedy and drama. The cola, the sulfa drug, Ruri getting better and Senku becoming the chief. Goddamn, this show is so good.     hypeeyes",1
809,So the village is named after his family name. I really want it to be his mother that founded it so I can potentially get a moment of Senku shedding a tear to realize he can no longer revive his parents... but I’m feeling like it could also be his science teacher or someone that respected his genius. Someone that realized Senku’s genius is what’s needed for this stone world.     Manga readers don’t spoil this for me,1
810,"TL;DR:    ""Thousands of years old man marries 18 years old priestess, divorces her, and invents drug that looks like cocaine""",1
811,"OK next to my home town in Japan there is a tiny village literally called Ishigami mura. Has to be just a coincidence not a direct reference, and there may be many Ishigami villages in Japan, it's just a common name derived from Ishi=Stone, GamiKami=God.  ""so... Senku is God of Stone World somehow""",1

I was a bit shocked when Senku won the tournament and had to marry Ruri but hey divorce is a thing! When Senku made the surprise cola for the magic man, that made me so happy. Senku is a good boy. You bet your ass the other opposing force would not give a shit about making a cola and just wants to take over the new world. Picking Senku's side is always the right choice.    And I have to say, Ruri is so freakin gorgeous. She has all the right curves too. There's no way I'd divorce her! Plus she's voiced by incredible Ueda Reina",1

830,Finally caught up to ya'll. Glad I decided to watch this. Love a show with science being the focus instead of raw strength or power of friendship. Seriously this show needs to be on every kids channel from now on.,1
831,What did Ruri say to her father in that silent scene?,2
832,she mouthed もう大丈夫 mou daijoubu - I'm fine now,1

The only thing i find weird is that if everyone in ishigami village is a descendant of papa ishigami, does that make senku everyone's great great great uncle or something??",1
838,"Not necessarily. The fact there's many of them means at least  two  people were resurrected. Senku's dad can't reproduce alone. And if there's two, it's not a stretch to say there were more, or that his dad figured out how to resurrect a few people. Also I doubt he let his kids just fuck each other and spawn an incest village. I'd wager there were few people around when it was founded.",0

So tuberculosis is a possibility.      Pneumonia?  Thats def treatable so this isnt bad!  That said, my dad did die of pneumonia, but he had a plethora of other issues that didnt help his situation, it was just the pneumonia that finished the job.  Its usually a lot more treatable.      Everyone is on Senku's side.  Good lets teach these people to beleive in science!      Is she all better now?  Is this a clean bill of health?  Shes scampering about so i guess so!

As a medical student it was really cool watching the medical aspect of how he listened for Egophony which is present when theres pleural effusion. Also the pharmacology aspect. Pretty cool stuff and was not expecting the show to go into stuff like that. Pretty unique for an anime IMO,1

860,"If that’s the end of the arc and it sure does feel like it then that was fun as hell. And the reveal at the end really gets things spicy for next episodearc.    Man 2019 is being a pretty good year for anime, I haven’t kept up new shows in years!",1
861,Well the ending video makes a lot more sense now,1
862,"A fantastic episode. I also really do like the new OP and ED. Low key think they are better than the first ones!    Did not see that coming, Senkuu winning the tournament! Loved that he ""divorced"" Ruri though. Kohaku is the girl for him!    I get the feeling one of Senkuu's parents un-petrified a long time ago and started this village. Which they talked about Senkuu coming along one day. If this is the case, it is probably about to get super emotional when thinking about them being dead.    CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK!",1
863,"     Weird way of spelling ""science.""",0
864,"So not sure if this was just me, but seeing Senku make that soda makes me wanna figure out how he did it.  Anyone got any ideas what was in the spinning bamboo??      Just from earlier in the episode I can guess that in that jug is either vinegar, sake or something else he put into a jug that resembled it?? Though my guess is that it would be vinegar and something he had added to it.  I'm still stumped on if there was something in the spinning bamboo or if it was just whatever was coming out of the jug on the ground.    Mostly because when I decided to try and look it up the stuff I found was talking about using pressurized Co2 to make soda.  The only guess that comes to mind is that Senku sealed whatever was in the jug and it emitted Co2 that then went through the tube into the bamboo and pressurized the water??  Why did the water need to be spinning then though?     Probably completely off topic but this was such an interesting thing that I really wanna figure out how the heck Senku did it.  Since normally the science in this show seems to be almost entirely accurate.",1
865,CO2 produced by alcohol fermentation and agitation to make it absorb faster.,0
866,"Ah so that's how.  When I was looking stuff up it looked like since not sure he had baking soda he might've combined the baking soda and vinegar to make the CO2 but the alcohol makes more sense.      Thanks for explaining the reasoning for the churning though, that was really confusing me.",1
867,"Respiratory therapy student here and I thought it was interesting that Senku used a assessment technique called ""Egophony""  say Eeeeee to determine that there's consolidation fluid in her lungs.",1
868,One of the best episodes I've seen in an anime in 5 years hands down. It took us on a journey getting us invested and paid off. Amazing show 1010 would watch again.,1
869,Its payoff after payoff  after payoff then a huge cliffhanger.,1
870,"That's what makes it so good, it keeps us coming running back.",1
871,"ahhahaha so Dr Stone did actually include the ""how to make"" of cola after all.    Anw if ruri already guessed who Senku is, why doesn't she make Senku announced his first namethus the village name to at least help him earn a bit of reptrust from the village.",1
872,"Ishigami is his last name, btw.    But it all comes to tradition, Senku is an outsider after all, they can't just trust him right away, especially the current top brass.",0
873,This episode was very well animated.,1
874,"This episode is so good! They really delivered on this one.    Now i'm very curious about the next episode. Also, when is Dr Stone gonna get that cola sponsorship? xD",1
875,"gotta love how boichi made ruri drinking the medicine look suggestive as all hell,    guess old habits die hard",0
876,you mean Gen swallowing Senku's fizzy bubbler,2
877,Best boy finally got his damn Cola. So happy for Gen.,1
878,My opinion is... THIS SERIES IS DAMN AWESOME!!,1
879,Did they make Ruri look extra curvy this episode? ,2
880,Ruri always had an extremely good body,1
881,Maybe I didn’t notice because she was sitting down for most of her showtime previously,2
882,"Where uh, can I read the manga...",2
883,"To get up to date you might need to check some ""grey area"" websites like the ones mentioned in the other replies, but once you catch up please make sure to read it on the official website from the publisher here To read back issues legally online you would need to use Viz or I think AmazonComixology might have them in digital format.",1
884,My favourite episode so far. The soundtrack was great as well. Waiting patiently for next week :,1
885,"Next episode we will be getting some tasty plot, also is it just me or does ruri look extra thicc in this episode compared to the others",2
886,What chapter is this in the manga? I want to read it now.,1
887,Next episode would be chapter 42,2
888,Thanks.,1
889,Episode 15 best episode ever 1010    Satisfying ending    Wonderful development     Nice cinematics    Bad guy got defeated    Senku became chief     The cola scene was nice    Ended on a cliffhanger causing me to be excited for the next episode,1
890,"Winning the tournament arc through science rather than being a jock, we did it Reddit.",1
891,"OK, I may geek out at science and also be a shounen nerd, but something about the ability to end the tournament arc, marry, divorce, make the cure-all montage, diagnose and cure Ruri, and still have time leftover to name Senku village leader is what makes Dr Stone fucking great to me.",1
892,Gen: I think that is the fate of a loner like me      find a cold Senku cola waiting for him     Me a small tear run down my face : I freaking love this show...,1
893,Can someone tell me what Dr Stone is about? Is it any good?,1
894,Its ark but anime,2
895,Imagine if Jojo's were a good Isekai and replace stand fights with real science as power system.,1
896,"I would say its quality ranges from good to excellent.    In few words it's a post-apocalyptic anime about a really smart guy that finds himself on Earth thousands of years in the future after society has crumbled and regressed to a very primitive stage. His works towards improving his way of life, and of those around him, while also searching for the reason everyone turned into stone during the apocalypse.    The main focus of the anime is how amazing science is and how it can make our lives better. It's a pretty optimistic and joyful show.",1
897,     memorized every scientific wikipedia article ,2
898,"So far this anime already broke the record in having the shortest lasting tournament arc, as tournament arcs tend to last at least 20 episodes and be riddled with flashbacks every 3 seconds. Let's see what it breaks next!",0
899,Tournament Arc with Marriage and Divorce in just 3 episodes,2
900,If Chainsaw Man gets an anime well....,2
901,I got to watch it when I get home from school,2
902,"Its uncomfortable and kind of surreal to think that the experience of Ruri and her family it's not so far from our reality as it may seem: we actually have a ton of cases of 'superbug' infections bacteria that became resistant to all or almost all antibiotics we know every year. There is a book about this called Superbug by Matt McCarthy, where the author explains why everyone should be a bit more concern about that.",0
903,"You really shouldn't be concerned about it as we are already making breakthroughs with the use of  phages to kill those bacteria.    Turns out bacteria that's resistant to antibiotics is super weak to phages and vice versa, and there's no way for them to build up BOTH resistances as that just makes them ""slightly"" resistant to both.    There was already a successful case of curing a guy who had a superbug inside of his body.  Now it's only a question of how quickly we can prepare similar methods for mass use.",0
904,The ending made me start reading the manga.,2
905,lol the divorce bit was funny. tbh more like senku is so funny.     cmon ruri who eats medicine like that     when she started choking up i thought it was because she had a sulfa allergy perhaps. but wow it worked out in the end that's great. now time for some juicy backstory next week please,1
906,Cliff hanger damn,0
907,I guess I’m the only one who’s account decided to not give me episode 15? Shows that they updated and added it but when I go to watch there’s no episode. I have up to 14 then nothing. I have premium and I keep updating my server but it still hasn’t shown up?,0
908,"IT was fucking great, best epi so far.",1
909,Why I can't stop watching this show ???  It's so good,1
910,Hey its all fun and stuff but we kinda forgot about the real threath here... Theres still Tarzan and his army of teenagers whos prolly gonna target them in the next episodes,1
911,lukewarm stone age cola,2
912,Better than no cola,1
913,Senku could have it stored in the river for a while and pulled it out just before he left. A cold river is as good as a Refrigerator for keeping things cold.,1
914,Was expecting the punchline for ginro'a fight is for him tp run out of energy due to the caffeine but this was better,1
915,CAN ANyONE SPOIL ME IN MY PM ABOUT ISHIGAMI VILLAGE,2
916,If Senku’s next move is not building defenses and weapons against the goku level humans a couple miles away in a cave he is no fucking genius...,0
917,you will be pleased in the next 2-3 episodes,1
918,I hope so. Ruri and I had pneumonia at the same time too but i just toughed it out.,1
919,There's a 10 billion percent chance I'll fucking lose it if I hear them say this fucking line one more time. Otherwise great show ,1
920,There's a 10 billion percent chance he'll say it again,1
921,Senku:  ah yes enslaved village ,2
922,"What a great episode. They really had me worried there for a minute when Ruri got worse, but I guess a lot of illnesses get worse initially when the medicine starts working.     And Gen finally got his cola. Senku may have a bit of an abrasive personality, but he really is a great guy.    Speaking of Senku, I can't wait to find out why Ruri knows who he is and the village has his last name. Judging by the ending song, I'm gonna guess it involves his dad somehow.",0
923,This has been the best episode so far. Everything paid off in this episode.,1
924,A great episode ! And proving how science is helpful !,1
925,That was EPIC. Completely epic. And fun. NICE.,1
926,If only Arthur Morgan got help from Senku,1
927,.,2
928,"The village was 1 bout close to have a Ginro as their dictator village chief. He may be worse than magma if that  was the case. Good thing that Senku put his senses back by nutting him.    Finally, the drug was given and Ruri Nee was healed. That medicine giving scene though....    Now, we can learn more about why the village was named the same as his family name. It may be a coincidence, maybe there was another japanese person who was not petrified and built a village. I doubt it was his father though, for all we know he maybe wasis dead when Senku was still a kid after selling his car to give senku all the science gadgets.    I think, having the village name is a clue for senku to unlocking the petrification incident. It is possible that there was a record of it by the very first village founder.",0
929,".....    I was so happy last episode.    So happy that this man was finally gonna get his girl  and  cure her after all his hard work.    and then this happens.     volibearQ    Even after Senku immediately divorces her, the just completely forget about all that  and so that never gets fixed. What the fuck, man.",1
930,Kohaku is his Lioness.,2
931,Pneumonia?     Fucking called it!,2
932,I forreal had goosebumps at the end,2
933,I get goosebumps while watching too.,2
934,i look forward to how they'll handle the next episode.,2
935,"My god, how could you not like this episode? It was a great conclusion to the current arc and a welcome to an episode which based on the title is probably going to be an exposition bomb.",1
936,"Well, Senku could have taken a page from Ginro's playbook, and as a leader, have both Kohaku and Ruri into his harem.",1
937,SCIENCE,2
938,This episode was epic. I'm glad I missed last week's episode and binge watched both of them today. All the effort put forward by everyone finally bears fruit and the sulfa drug saved her. I'm so damn happy right now. I want to drink cola right now.,1
939,The best thing about this episode... think back to how much Senku and the Kingdom of Science has done with just their small crew and Chrome's shack. Now Senku has an entire village with a population that now thoroughly believes in science. We're going to do so much more.,1
940,awesome episode! kingdom of science did it! also that ending was pretty shocking,1
941,A couple of episodes ago Ruri did something that made Senku question her knowledge about the world.    Anyone remembers what it was?,2
942,She acted like she knewrecognized Senku's last name,1
943,She knew what last names were even though no one in the village has one.,0
944,"So his dad broke free first?     Yay, Ruri is saved! And now that she's a divorced woman, she can actually marry Chrome.",1
945,That episode was awesome just gave me warmth and happiness. Too much wholesomeness.,1
946,OH SHIT THIS EPISODE IS 1010!,0
947,I started reading this thread when the dub for Episode 8 is on Toonami in the US. Seeing how far we’ve gone in this arc is neat.,1
948,"Imagine being Gen and waiting for this cola for fucking months only to spill a bunch of it all over yourself in your anticipation to drink it. Terrible table manners, immersion ruined, 010. s    But seriously, this episode was a good set of feels and comedy. Senku divorcing immediately was brilliant and Ruri only living so long because of Kohaku’s water runs was a good touch.",1
949,He knows Senkuu can make more Gola. He's drinking without brakes. It's more about experiencing the moment briefly leaving the stone world and being back in modern times than the quantity consumed.,2
950,"Medical Dr here: young healthy people don't usually get chronic recurrent pneumonia, bitch probably immunocompromised hope for chrome's sake not because of HIV",1
951,"Dr. Dude, there are dead and skeletonized rodents lying in the open in this village.    At the very least their non-refrigerated food stores, and probably their water supply are contaminated.    Nobody talks about boiling water to disinfect it, Kohaku goes some distance somewhere to get spring or geyser water of unknown minerals in solution and bacterial load see the Sulfuric Acid springs episode.    There are no signs of agriculture or even animal husbandry.  We don't even know what these people are eating, with the possible exception of fish and game meat, watermelons, wine and vinegar.  By modern standards, they are likely undernourished. Or at the very least lacking in key vitamins or other nutrients that we take for granted.    It would be no surprise if chronic undiagnosed illness is common in the village, and most of them die before they're 40.      Crafting zi-san looks like the exception, but he could be younger than he looks.    The entire village is probably younger than they look, given pre-civilization lifestyle stress on their bodies.",0
952,"Yup you're totally right, though that would make me think of some weird ass bacteria other than pneumoccocus, like yersinia the black plague or cryptosporum, or maybe even some crazy parasites because you mentioned untreated water.    Anyway with her clinical picture and no signs of widespread infection in the community, it could be a ton of things even noninfectious. But before any of those, or anything else, chronic cough with blood+ infectious signs = tuberculosis like 80% of the time, if I were senku I would have started with some anti-tb drugs.     Senku behaved like a real doctor though: weird disease I know nothing about --     Hahaha that made me laugh, ojii-san is probably like 30 years old",1
953,Senku casually spitting those chemical compound names makes me wish I paid more attention in my high school chemistry classes...,1
954,"Yep, this is all staying removed.",1
955,"I remember getting a tear in my eye when I saw Gen get his fucking cola in the manga, its too good!!",1
956,for a sec I thought Senku really spent 6 months workin on that good shit to make Ruri snort,0
957,That's some BS ending it there.,2
958,He probably guessed either that would work or there's nothing he could've done anyway.,2
959,Who the f administers medication before even performing a physical exam,2
960,"Someone with no better options. Doctors often pump patients full of drugs in an emergency situation, if they don't think the drugs will make things worse and  might  make them better. Diagnosis is a luxury.",0
961,Yes obviously but chronic pneumonia is not an emergency. The acute symptoms began after treatment with the sulfa drug. Obviously these symptoms need to be managed during treatment. It should also be obvious the events were accelerated from drug administration to remission which is fine because zero people watching dr stone including me want to see all the details.    It's just absurd to see skipping a lung exam we do all the time that takes less than 5 minutes that would obviously be done wayyyy before treatment.    This is my limited knowledge as a third year medical student.,1
962,"Well, Senku is a highschooler.",1
963,"With knowledge and, until this point, reason far beyond his years.",2
964,"Sure, but pobody's nerfect.",1
965,word,2
966,"What was he supposed to do?    Diagnose her then say ""damn the thing we been working on for the past year is useless better throw it out lol""    It's better to give it first since she's as good as dead regardless.",1
967,See my other reply. Ultimately its all good because it's just anime and I love it regardless. Just caught me off guard because we do lung exams with chronic lung diseases first even before lab work.,1
968,Ahh Ruri what a beauty !!,1
969,Guys I live in India and I want to start watching Dr.Stone. Can someone give me a website that i can actually access?,1
970,try looking in FB dr stone groups some random people post it,2
971,Try anyme.app I can access it just fine while I visited Vizag last year.,1

974,Bless Tatsuya Katou.,1
975,Lets not forget the best face in the episode,0
976,So not really related to the episode but... Senku and Kigali ship anyone?,2
977,As soon as gen started walking back to the hut I knew the cola bottle would be on the table and I was so happy for him.    Also how does she know his name wtfff,1
978,para-ecetamidobezenesulfonyn chloride,2
979,man Senku is such a beast,2
980,I had to read a few chapters after watching this episode. And Oh boy  it's  gonna be  LITT!,2
981,DADDY,2
982,the way Senku feeds Ruri the medicine KEK,2
983,so Senku's father created the village?,1
984,Ah Chrome you almost had won the bout o'well at least Senku only took the position of village chief. Good to see all of Senku and the gang hard work finally pay off and that he keep his promise to Gen. Can't wait to learn how Ruri knew Senku full name.,1
985,"Good minor changes to scenes, bad cola scene. Evens out I guess, but the ending still delivers.",0
986,Its called Science. The culmination of human wisdom.,1
987,i wonder what the science behind the cure all petrification is. i hope they explain it. then we can have it in real life and fix all diseases!,1
988,I had no idea someone can suffer from pnemonia for  10 years and survive.    A little weird that Senku can spend half a year near the village and never once hear its name even in mention.,0
989,"It's not  all  that unlikely, to be honest. In the same way language names, particularly more primitive ones, can be translated as ""correct speech"", people from that village probably only call it ""village"".",1
990,I wonder who the hell it was who Senku knew who founded the village?,0
991,The content of this episode and the next one are what really hooked me into the Manga. Can't wait for next week,2
992,I see its 24 episodes for the doctor stone anime. 9 remaining.,2

1009,So Senku's dad parents were the founders years ago? My goodness,1
1010,liked the episode but it's a real shame that they skimmed through a lot of stuff so quickly.,0
1011,I don’t understand the ending when they associated his name and the village name,2
1012,The next episode will explain why,2
1013,Did anyone try putting lemon zest on crushed cilantro?,0
1014,I'll never look at cola the same way again... and I'll also never take it for granted. Ever.,1
1015,Aww Kohaku is a sweetheart.    Wait what?? The village's name is ISHIGAMI? Tbh I don't remember anyone saying his last name until a few chapters ago which is kinda weird for a japanese anime.,1
1016,I think we all know where this is going... jk,1
1017,Senku will be the new Isaac Newtown,2
1018,Wait. I thought it airs on saturdays?,2
