15,"Old Kaseki, A man ready to craft some good shit",1
16,This man literally only exists just to craft some high quality shit. God I fucking love Kaseki so much.,1
17,And to pose.,2
18,Nice to see that the years haven't been too rough on Machio,1
19,Yea after Machio's body building stint in the IFBB he was the first human to flex out of his stone and live humbly as a craftsmen.,2
20, He did some other side gigs I heard...      slowgrin,2
21,How to guarantee you're the first one to escape global-scale petrification don't think that's a word:   eat clean tren hard  .,1

23,Rich? Is that you?,1
24,"God, I miss Rich",1
25,"I don't miss that ""one day you may"" tat. Did he ever explain that tat? ""One day you may"" what, Rich? One day we may suck on your muscly tan teet? Well not anymore, since he's...you know...dead. BUT ""one day you may"" WHAT??",1
26,"That's legitimately disgusting. He's recommending 1200 calories of shake, 2-3 times a day. Either you are well exceeding 4000 calories a day or you are going to have the worst diarhea.",0
27,Just BULK OUT of the stone.,2
28,TEST YOURSELF,2
29,and to be one of the few that doesn't get confused by Senku and is actually interested in the new stuff,1
30,"With those slightly pointed ears, Kaseki is basically just a dwarf and I love it. Would Kohaku be the elf?",1
31,"A short, sturdy creature fond of industry. Went from Minecraft to Dwarf Fortress real quick. Can't wait until they make the magma cannon.",1
32,"To be fair, if they introduce him to that wine they made in the early episodes then they might just awaken something inside him.",1
33, ,2
34,Magma cannon? That's beginner shit. If you're a real dwarf you'd go for the fully automated mermaid farm.,0
35,Just send him to fight Magma. Why train KinraJinra?,0
36,"Hell, just send him to fight Tsukasa!",0
37,"Be like ""hey, Magma. There's this guy named Tsukasa who thinks that you look like a nerd.""",1
38,I meant sending Kaseki to fight Tsukasa.    We don't want Magma near Tsukasa as then Tsukasa would quickly learn Senku's alive.,0
39,Unless Tsukasa dies first! Which is why sending Magma is a great idea,1
40,Magma stands negative chance against Tsukasa.  Remember that Tsukasa dominated Kohaku who's already beaten Magma before.,0
41,Ten billion percent chance he loses.,0
42,"Also, you know, he beat several lions...",2
43,Oh right.,2
44,"Furthermore he would quickly become the village elder and thus enforce his bizarre ideology on them since he would eat Magma for breakfast if he fought them in the ""Grand Bout"".",0

59,HEAR HEAR!     i was waiting for him so bad. i love the science enthusiast crew coming together.,1
60,At long last,2
61,"He’s never seen what they were doing before, and could already figure out how they were f cking up.",2
62,And getting all sorts of pissed off at them for it.    A true craftsman,0
63,"Damn right, the old dude is the boss, ready to show everyone how things are done.",0
64,BEST FRIEND,1
65,I like Senku’s capacity to bait people. It’s even more amusing to watch given he loves it.,1
66,And then he makes a scary face about how much use he's gonna get out of the people he's baited.,0
67,"Ginro: Ha-ha! In your face Kinro, I'm getting a silver spear!      Senku: So you've already accepted your payment for this mission. It will be awarded to you or your remains after it's done.    Ginro: Come again?",1
68,"     Oof, but also accurate lmao.",1
69,Conditions might apply. The condition is that your remains must be recoverable.,2
70,"I wonder what the element they are looking for, Mercury maybe?",2
71,It should be something which has wide range of applications and without it we can't progress ahead.,0
72,"If there was a series from Tsukasa's eyes, Senku would easily be bad guy material",0
73, Tsukasa is a serial killer.,0
74,"What Tsukasa is doing isn't serial killing, it's genocide, literally.    And yet, if Senku refused to even hear me out on some modifications to the new old world, I'd side with him.",1
75,"True, they would also have to make Tsukasa look MUCH better.",1
76,"Hey if it works.    Goddamn do they get the grouchy craftsman's mindset down perfectly.   That was like watching myself watching my husband in the kitchen I'm normally the cook and I cook as a hobby.  ""No no, you're doing it wrong.   No, that goes there.  Don't use metal in my nonstick pans!  Dude, it'll go a lot faster and you'll get more even pieces if you...  you know what, move, I'll do it, just stir that pot please.""",0
77,"It's also good writing because his manipulation comes from understanding what being passionate about a craft is like. Just need to look at how moved and proud he looks when he sees Kaseki working; he has that ""Mama Bucciarati looking at his Children"" look",1
78,     And you didn't immediately stab him? You have the patience of a saint.,1
79,He's just completing all the loyalty missions.,1
80,Senku making glasses made me tear up. Suika being able to see is just so heartwarming. One of my favorite moments from the manga.,1
81,"As someone who is growing more and more dependant on glasses as the ages go by, that scene hit really hard. I couldn't imagine how hard would it be to live your entire life with shitty, blurry vision. We really take a lot of stuff for granted these days.    Things like this is why I love Dr. Stone. It's an insanely entertaining show that also makes you actually appreciate more things about life that you wouldn't even think about.",1
82,"     This is my favorite thing about the show. Senku keeps making things that none of the viewers would be amazed by but seeing the reactions of the villagers really puts things into perspective. I've had to wear glasses since I was a kid and every time I put them away whenever I go swimming, I realize how fucked I'd be if they were never invented. I'm pretty thankful I was born in this age.",0
83,"The commentary and reactions in this show are some of the best things about it, especially as it depicts things much more differently than we normally would     just like the monkey commentary from before ",1
84,Speak for yourself im as excited as Chrome to see whatever Senku comes up with.,1
85,Not just the science but the craftsman is also something to be respected,1
86,I loved how no one said a word after she put on     womanlytears,1
87,"It was really amazing in the manga already. It's a great example of panelling: you get all these small panels with close-ups before Suika puts the glasses on - then when she does, a close-up of a sunflower drawn in  incredible  detail, and that amazing two-page spread of the sunflower field in wide angle. It was a really powerful moment, and entirely delivered with visual storytelling. Boichi knows his shit.",1
88,High detail close-ups and landscapes are two of the things Boichi absolutely  kills  pretty much every time. It's wonderful seeing them in color with music.,1
89,"I had to look it up, that's gorgeous",1
90,The close up of the one flower is good too,1
91,what chapter is it? I want to see the general panel-work,1
92,28,2
93,It could be nice gag if instead of sumflowers she would see close up of far red house or red ballon,1
94,I hope that i'm not the only grown man that cried like a little bitch,0
95,I'd expect any properly grown-ass man to cry at that shit. That scene was  beautiful ,0
96,"Wow, did not expect to see that here. Why did you have to bring that back up ;.;",1
97,You should probably spoiler tag that.,2

100,"Crunchyroll's youtube channel put out a video yesterday about the production of Dr. Stone. It's a full explanation of the animation process and the people involved. They also go into a bit of depth about the mindset of this particular scene when adapting it to animation. Sadly I watched it before the episode so the glasses thing was a bit of a spoiler, but I still ended up tearing up a bit during that scene. It was just so well handled.",1
101,It just made me think of the first time I got glasses. All I remember is I couldn't stop smiling for quite a while. It's sad to think how many people could never see properly.,0
102,"As a kid I remember having 2020 vision and not really realizing it was degrading over time. By the time I was 16 we realized I needed glasses.        It's funny, when they tested me for the glasses I was in this sterile room and I thought nothing of it because I was just looking at the letters and shapes to confirm what prescription was needed.  A couple of days later I'm given my first set of glasses and try them on. I remember a sudden and uncontrollable urge to cry just by suddenly being bombarded by the details of everything around me, and that was just in the store. I walked outside and saw the grass, the trees. I don't think I'll ever forget that moment, seeing individuals leaves just being moved gently by the wind. I still tear up remembering about it.    Seeing her tear up, reminded me of that moment, it really hit home.",0
103,"I feel ya. Went through the same thing, only I spent a year bot realising I needed glasses. At some point I just started to take the fuzzy illness for granted.     I still remember putting on glasses and being amazed seeing the leaves on trees.     As I said then, it was like watching all your life in 240p and suddenly switching to HD.",1
104,Nothing quite like seeing a tree for the first time after getting glasses.,0
105,"I got glasses when I was Suika's age and it was really just a marvel. I couldn't stop staring at everything and seeing all the incredible detail. From my fingerprints, to the veins in a leaf... even the individual hairs on my parents' heads.    Especially seeing my dog with clear vision. That hit home so hard, cause I had a puppy at that age too. She was my constant playmate.",1
106,"I remember, I was in an asian buffet restaurant with some friends. As a joke I put on one of my friend's glasses and realised that you could see the leaves on the trees outside. I spent literally the next 45 minutes during dinner just staring at the leaves outside baffled by the details.",1
107,Did you get your own pair of glasses after that?,2
108,Took a bit but ya. I've had mine since middle school now and I'm 100% dependant on them.,2
109,I literally thought as a child that people drew trees' leaves as a green cloud-blob because it was impossible to see individual leaves from afar. Now I have LASIK operated eyes and it's definitely easy to lose perspective that it's magic how thanks to science I never even have to worry about not distuinguish objects again in my life.,1
110,same,2
111,"Dr Stone made me realize I've taken glasses for granted. Hell, I've taken everything for granted. This episode really almost made me just go ahead and binge the manga but the anime is too much fun.",1
112,"I can see  10 centimetres in front of me before everything becomes a blurry mess significantly more blurry than what suika saw in the show to the point I can't make out anything except colors    I've had this since the day I was born but I only got my glasses when I turned 16 because I was afraid of being made fun of at school and it was absolute hell I can tell you, science is truly a blessing on this world.",1
113,"I can totally relate to that scene when she clearly saw the sunflower field for the first time. I couldn't stop smiling when I put contacts on for the first time and started seeing the world around me in HD.    As a side effect, women got uglier.",0
114,It made me tear up how well done the scene was. They perfectly showed how it feels to not be able to see and suddenly the clarity of the world around you. I didn’t have glasses until I was almost 18 because I had no idea I needed them and the moment I got them made me cry.,1
115,Same here man. I'm 23 and I've had glasses since I was 4. I can't function without these damn things my vision is so bad now -12 prescription with a side helping of astigmatism.,1
116,"It's arguable that if you grew up without tech you probably wouldn't need glasses. An increase in short sightedness has been a biproduct of a literate society. More reading, more shortsightedness.",1
117,"It was a really great moment.    To gift someone one of their senses, even if it is correcting it, makes a huge impact on one's life.    It's nice to see that that was the first thing Senku did with it.    It's also amazing how he realized why she was wearing that thing in the first place.",1
118,"Yea I kinda teared up at that scene cuz it reminded me of when I first got glasses in like 3rd grade, I was just so blown away seeing the world clearly for the first time and seeing Suika experience it too was so adorable",1
119,"     This was such great writing! It just seems like a shonen quirk at first, or at most like it's going to be an arc about her being shy. But no, it's because little holes help with vision, Senku deduces this and tells her she isn't ""sick"".     Then you think she's going to ditch the helmet, but Senku instead makes her one with glasses because he knows she likes it. Great stuff.",1
120,"As someone who gave people the chance to see better Optometrist, this warms my heart. I love when my patients are very happy when they see things better from a worse eyesight.     Glasses are the foundation of eyeglasses but we have moved to a plastic material a long time ago to reduce the risk for the eyes in case of breakage. Grinding the glass to the right curvature giving the prescription grade is already hard enough. I'll just assume that Suika, and hopefully Kinro, are just a case of simple nearsightedness and not astigmatism as that will complicate the making of the lenses.",1
121,I can only shudder at the thought of the scratches her lenses will receive when she starts rolling off to places,2
122,It's anime glasses she'll be fine,1
123,When I found out that was why I saw lights at night as 'blurry' I was shocked to learn it wasn't the normal way of seeing it.,0
124,"Tbh, I kinda prefer it, it's aesthetic.",2
125,I loved the stone age eye exam with shapes instead of letters.,1
126,"it's not stone age, eye exams often use shapes for kids that can't read yet. although, I'm not sure what's the stance on reading in Dr. Stone.",0
127,"I think you can guess already but  ""they can't read or write, there's no written language that was passed on from the past. In a much later chapter it becomes a plot point that Kohaku needs to communicate a message in writing and she uses scribbles and ideograms to convey her meaning.""",0
128,"I'm glad that they kept the melon head for her,    even though she's cute without it.",1
129,"I'm excited for Kinro to get some ""angry teacher"" glasses so he can push them up in an annoyed manner",0
130,Same as much as I love our community I'd hate to see what some people would draw,1
131,Pft it’s like you don’t even know them. A melon helmet can’t defend you.,1

134,Suika is just too damn cute!!!,1
135,"Spent a whole 4 episodes waiting for that reveal. Then, when that face went from Moe Heaven to Crabapple, a little part of me died inside. ",0
136,"I remember having a similar awe-struck feeling when I first got glasses back in middle school. I had just been so used to seeing blurry that it was normal for me.    Then I put on my first pair of glasses and I lit up like a kid in a candy store.    This scene reminded me of that and yeah, it got to me too.    I think anyone who, like me, was born or at least developed nearsightedness very early in life can just super relate to this scene. It's crazy how much just  seeing  things for basically the first time ever is such an emotional moment, and you realize that you've just had a whole ass part of you restored.",1
137,I cry once an episode at this point.,0
138,"I love that there was no dialogue there. There really aren't words for your first sight with glasses, especially if you've had bad eyes from birth. There are few experiences like it - in an instant,  everything  changes, but at the same time, you know that nothing changed but you. This is how the world has always been and you just never knew until that moment how much you were missing out on.",0
139,They really handled the scene perfectly!,1
140,"Oh, so that's why Suika was wearing that thing on her head? I wonder at what point will Senku become aware that Kinro also needs a pair of glasses.     It comes to no surprise that the highly skill crafter literally looks like a dwarf.",1
141,I'm suspicious that's how they'll win the grand bout.  Either that or Senku will build Chrome a flamethrower.,1
142,"Yes, Suika  ""the stone world`s first meganeko""!",1
143,"AWW    Glasses are such an achievement in science. Throughtout 8th grade my vision started going bad, and I ended up having to stand close to the board to see what was written on it, always squinting like Suika. Putting on my glasses for the first time was amazing because I hadn't been able to see clearly for months. That's what Suika felt when she put her glasses on. The world suddenly becomes clear and beautiful and you're actually able to appreciate the details.    So while Suika is nearsighted, Kinro's farsighted    These are the faces of failure    Little Kohaku!    Kaseki's freaking ripped!",1
144,Great screenshots.    Glasses are seriously amazing.    We use them for so many different things.,1
145,One of the main reasons I come to discussion threads sometimes are just to see stitches and gifs of some scenes,2
146,Have      mugistronk,2
147,     ripping his shirt purely through mussels flexing was bad ass as fuck,1
148,If you're not watching Dumbbells already you're going to enjoy Machio.,1
149,"     I don't think Kinro is farsighted. Any thing within arms reach is considered near distance. His problem is perceiving the incoming attack when he have the reach advantage of a spear. Another sign is him squinting making his eyes looking like mad. Squinting is a natural reaction for our eyes to see better. Remember the pinhole effect that Senku said, squinting can make your field of vision as small as possible thus seeing a bit better.",1
150,"Actually, I think all of that may be a sign of him being farsighted. Being farsighted means it takes a lot more effort to see close objects, so a fast incoming object might be hard to see clearly the eyes haven't had time to adjust. Squinting is then just a reaction to straining your eyes.",2
151,"     The first part of your statement is true but a fast  incoming  object is still from a far distance. In Kinro's case he is having the hard time determining the proper distance from the incoming attack. Depth perception is also the problem here. Depth perception is the visual ability that enables you to make spatial judgments, including how far away an object or person is from you.         It is the opposite. As I said it makes your vision a bit better and the straining your eyes is the secondary effect so you really don't want to do that all the time when you have nearsightedness just to see clearly. Let the lenses do clarification for you.",1
152,"I'm actually farsighted myself not very much either, and I can tell you it made it quite a bit harder to gauge distance when playing badminton for example. Having to adjust your eyes to track the incoming object is very tiring.    Anyway, Ginro mentioned that Kinro, like Suika, has ""blurry-eyes disease"", so it's clearly not just a problem with depth perception. It's probably far-sightedness, near-sightedness but I guess not as bad as Suika, or maybe strabismus though I don't know much about that.",1
153,"     No, Yes not as bad as or near as Suika's, and Strabismus is commonly known as cross-eyed or one or both the eyes are misalignednot centered so definitely not that.    EDIT:          I would like to emphasize on this. Having blurry eye as a disease is a very common misconception and I'm glad Senku clarified it too. Refractive Error is not a disease and not a defect. The closest term I can personally give is it is a  structural error  that the eye can't manage to focus the light exactly on to the retina",1
154,So then what's the solution to that?,1
155,I'd assume glasses as well? If he's shortsighted that is.    IIRC It's a lot more complex to make farsighted glasses,1
156,He needs glasses like Suika. But he doesn't know about them and he's too proud to speak up about the issue.  Hopefully he finds out about them from Suika.,1
157,"I might have worded that poorly. He has nearsightedness and still the same solution, glasses.     The kind of glasslenses will be different in correcting nearsighted and farsightedness though. To correct a nearsightedness you will a need a concave lenses while on the other hand you will need a convex lenses to correct farsightedness.",1
158,Glasses with reversed curvature if he's farsighted. Low key isn't this farisghted stuff a spoiler though I'm anime only,0
159,"I think people are assuming, and I think they're assuming wrongly.     Idk I'm anime only",0
160,It'd really freaking suck if he needed eye surgery or something. I don't think Senku can take THAT risk.,0
161,"I got really emotional watching that scene. I didn't get my glasses until I was about 16 years old. I always had to sit near the front and it sucked when teachers wanted assigned seats because I just couldn't take notes. Finally, I went to an eye doctor and got some glasses and walking outside and seeing that the world actually had detail and you could make out what was 10 feet ahead of you was amazing. Trees had shapes. Clouds weren't just blobs in the sky. Signs were actually readable.     This one sequence has really made me appreciate both this series and the fact that someone discovered how to fix vision way back when.",1
162,"I've heard teachers tell stories about the kid who they thought came up and stood close to the board because they wanted attention, but then they got glasses and stopped.",0
163,"It's kinda weird, since we've always taken glasses for granted, but only now we can see how it is for people who discover it for the first time",1
164,     I had shit eyesight since I was a child. Some teachers thought I was an hyperactive kid or even a troublemaker because I kept getting off my seat.    I was just too blind to see the board and kept standing to walk to it and see what was actually on it.,0
165,"10 years ago my biology teacher always said that without science almost noone would need to have glasses, since only the ones with actually good eyesight could survive in a primitive environment.",1
166,her squinting face reminded me of the old shopkeep alien with a volcano head from redline.,2
167,"It was so sweet, I think I got Diabetes when Suika got her   labor potential   sight back.     That was a useful melon, both for espionage and improving her vision.",1

188,Give Chrome some knock out chemical and all he needs to do is get it on Magma's face.  Game over for Magma.,2
189,Would the village allow that?    Would they allow “sorcery”?,1
190,"How would they know what is going on?  It doesn't have to be some flashy powder cloud, but something on Chrome's hands that is invisible and that Chrome has taken the 'antidote' for.  Magma all off a sudden feels really really really weak, and Chrome bitchslaps him to the ground.  Then Chrome neutralizes the chemical ringside and game over.  The village would be utterly clueless.",0
191,Could work,2
192,Making such chemicals are hard though. They’re incredibly sensitive to dosage on top of that.,1
193,Well that's true.  But I would suppose you could just refine something from nature.,1

195,What makes it so crazy? I don’t personally mind spoilers.,0
196,"It's crazy in the sense that it's super creative with some stuff, outsmarting your opponents etc. It's not your usual power through and get strong type of fights, similar to how HxH in a way, but the creativity goes a bit over the top :. Which is a great thing since the series is supposed to be science based for the most part.",1
197,any idea on how many episodes it might last?,2
198,"If I had to guess, probably 2.5-3 episodes. It is pretty short for a tournament arc, but that is to be expected when you have such a small village.",1
199,You clearly must watch more Shonen,1
200,Did any JoJo parts ever had a tournament arc?,2
201,Joseph in Kars' mansion and vs Wamu in the finals was the ultimate tournament arc ofc,2
202,"I said the most ridiculous one, not the best one",0
203,I know,2
204,"I mean I honestly can't think of any shounen with a more ridiculous tournament arc that was ridiculous in a good way. Though tbf, I haven't completely read or seen pretty much any of older shounen 80's and 90's because they tend to have pretty much only action and barely any plot at all.     I'm guessing sth that might get a ridiculous tournament arc later on might be Jojo. But I haven't watched past the first season because I didn't really enjoy the first two parts. It's just that I can't enjoy action heavy shounen with no plot. I might still continue watching someday because later parts might have more plot and thus might be more enjoyable. Or they might have other elements that make them enjoyable for me instead.",1
205,"The only comparable one is hunter x hunter, but I'd say that's hardly the best part of the series, if not mistaken it's considered one of the worst arcs of the series along with the island one, ironically I loved both. But like dr.stone it focuses more on outsmarting the opponent instead of the typical shonen power through will or some power up out of nowhere. Gon vs Hisoka is probably my favorite fight of all shonens and it's from that tournament, i'd tell you to watch it but it might be hard to understand some stuff without context.        Yu Yu hakosho also has a tournament arc that is pretty great.",1
206,"I mean, I would hardly call the tournament arc in HxH ridiculous. It's been over 3 years since I watched the anime, so I don't remember much. I'm assuming you mean Heavens Arena and not the Hunter Exam since you mentioned Gon vs Hisoka.    I tried getting into Yu Yu Hakusho, but eventually stopped reading during the Dark Tournament, because I was unable to enjoy it. It was just pure action without plot all the time. There was neither comedy nor great character interactions to make up for the lack of plot, which is why I was unable to enjoy it. I guess I just read up until the Dark Tournament because I heard of how great it is and then ended up being disappointed.    I get why others enjoy these kinds of shounen, but it's simply not the type of shounen I enjoy. I need at least plot, comedy or good character interactions on top of action to enjoy a battle shounen. Though what I consider good characters or good character interactions is quite different from what a lot of others think.    For me, characters usually get enabled through plot and comedy. So if neither is there or both of them are unenjoyable, I often can't come to like the characters either. In most cases, either plot or comedy is enough to enable the characters and make me like them. So it doesn't take both. Most 90's shounen manga or anime I've read or seen didn't really have a plot and if they have comedy, it's often pretty outdated.     Though tbf, I haven't seen or read that much from the 80's or 90's. So I'm not going to judge stuff I haven't seen yet based on this. However I still go in with low expectations when reading or watching older stuff, especially when it comes to shounen.    And tbh, for the exact same reason, I didn't enjoy the beginning of One Piece, because it was too action heavy. I only really started enjoying it when they entered the Grand Line and now it's not surprisingly one of my favourite manga.",1
207,"Yu Yu Hakusho does have that issue, but I don't think HxH has it. I don't think there's any battle shonens  100% without the issues you mentioned besides HxH and some recent ones, but if you go outside the spectrum a bit you find a lot of old stuff with good character development, the problem is that usually those series are half episodic, trigun comes to mind in that regard, or are full episodic like cowboy bebop which is something you stated not to like because there's not long running plot. I have the same opinion tbh, if there isn't a main plot it's hard to like a show, I don't mind episodic stuff if there's a main plot behind it. Regardless I still watch everything since I have a lot of time nowadays :         Hitman Reborn is episodic at first as well but gets good halfway through, I wouldn't recommend it nowadays tho.  It's hard to recommend older stuff in the battle genre mainly because of the older animation, especially long running shows like hitman reborn, rurouni kenshin and yu yu hakusho suffer a lot from that, 90% of the enjoyment of those shows are the battles, unless you're used to old animation, you won't like it nowadays. The manga's are great tho, Air gear for example, the anime has really shitty fights animation wise, but the manga has great panels and holds up even today  I didn't like either one but it's a good example . But at the time they were released that animation was great.        Not to say that there aren't any good older animated shows, eureka seven the original not the crappy AO has insane animation for the time, I'd even state that it beats 90% of the new shows on that regard, same with trigun, cowboy bebop, black lagoon, among others. But inside the battle shonen especifically the animation was really poor just due to how their releases were designed, I wish these shows were all remade like HxH 2011.         If there's an older battle shonen that I'd recommend even nowadays is Baki tv not the ovas, has good character development, has an overarching plot, it's smart battle wise more about technique instead of raw power, and the animation is really good and watchable even nowadays. Baki has two main parts, like dragon ball it starts with him young, and then you have the other arcs where he's grown up, the first part has worse animations and there's definitely parts that are kinda boring but the second part is great, also has a tournament arc. I can't recommend the netflix series, that cgi ruins everything, I'd say just watch the original tv show and for the new arcs read the manga.",1
208,"I mean, you're right although Naruto for example had a plot until the war. So the issue didn't arise until shortly before its conclusion.  Back when I read it, I didn't really mind it in that case, but I guess my taste changed since then.      I actually don't really mind episodic stuff if there's good comedy or the characters are well written. Gintama is among my favourite anime of all time despite being episodic for the most part. Though it has a plot as well, but I still really enjoyed the episodic parts. Another episodic show I really enjoyed was Asobi Asobase, though again it's mainly because of the comedy.    I actually haven't seen Trigun yet and I only watched the first episode of Cowboy Bebop, but never got to watch further. Good to know that I shouldn't be expecting a full fledged plot from them. Otherwise I would've probably gone in with too high expectations.    Yeah, I agree that older shows tend to be mostly about fights. Personally, I prefer it if the characters fight for plot reasons and not just for the sake of fighting. I haven't seen Hitman Reborn yet, but have it on my plan to watch list. And I agree with the old animation. It's another reason why I usually don't watch older anime pre 2006. Though there are some anime after 2006 that still have the dated animation. Though there are some exceptions like Monster or Gintama's first season where I didn't mind the 4:3 ratio and the older animation. Though they both had pretty good animation.    I actually watched the first 9 episodes of Eureka Seven, but didn't really enjoy it up until that point. I guess Renton was too annoying for me as an MC. It was already more than 2 years ago though so I don't remember that much.    I wasn't even aware the Baki OVA's were sequels of an older tv anime. Good to know because they were on my plan to watch list. Now I'm going to replace them with the prequel I guess. I will watch them sometime, but probably not all too soon.    I mean I would really like to find a good shounen anime I haven't seen yet that has the newer animation. I guess Sket Dance is the only one that comes to mind that I haven't seen yet, but probably should watch very soon. I know it's very similar to Gintama, so I'll probably like it. Oh, and I have to finally get up to date with Kimetsu no Yaiba.    Other than that, I've seen pretty much everything from Shounen Jump that got an anime. Though I dropped Black Clover and Kuroko no Basuke. I still kinda follow the Black Clover manga just because I got into it when the first chapter dropped and I still liked the kind of action heavy anime and manga. But now I just follow it for the sake of it, but don't really enjoy it much anymore, mainly because of some directions the writing has taken. I mean it has more plot than older manga, but it's still mainly just fights the whole time and the plot has lots of flaws.    So I'm mainly just reading currently running manga in Shounen Jump and trying out the new ones hoping it is something I enjoy. Though there are also new manga that end up surviving that I don't enjoy like Jujutsu Kaisen and Chainsaw Man. But stuff like Dr. Stone except for the first arc or Act-Age are great. From the newest batch, Mission Yozakura's Family is good so far.",1
209,"Both Cowboy bebop and trigun have plot, but cowboy bebop only in the final  eps, and trigun is halfway through, it almost becomes a completely different anime, I highly recommend watching it since it's really unique.     Eureka seven is like that too, I think it's 20+ eps of episodic stuff, when I rewatch it I just skip it tbh. The plot is really unique like trigun but if you didn't like renton, half of it is about renton and eureka, so I can't recommend if you didn't like them, as you're bound to dislike the series.    Haven't seen Sket Dance, I'll put it on my list :    Black Clover is an anime that I'm really glad I stuck with it, ep 100 was a blast to watch. Can't say it's one of my favorites, it's average at best, but watchable.     Enen no shouboutai has amazing animation, if you're not watching it you should 100%. The story and setting is pretty unique and has kept me interested so far. The only critique I have against it is the fan service in innapropriate moments, If not mistaken ep9 has the worst offense I ever seen in any anime.    I wish I had more time to read manga, the reason I watch so many anime's is mostly because I work as a digital artist, so I have them as background half the time. Therefore I'm not caught up with current shonen jump releases, dr.stone is the only one I follow currently, but I wouldn't call it a battle shonen :v",1

224,"So we're using the trope of ""Kinro's problem would be so easily fixed if he just talked about it"", but it makes a lot of sense why he doesn't want to admit it.    I find it super heartwarming that the very first thing they did with the glass was make Suika glasses instead of just plowing ahead with the main goal.",1
225,It helps that glasses blanks are an excellent test run for their glass production. Anything more complicated than a solid disk required more skill than they had,1
226,"Eh they didn't need to make glasses. Actually turning the glass into usable and solid lenses would actually be heinously difficult with the way they did it. Like I don't care how much trial and error they used, manually grinding glass into prescription lenses would be so ridiculously hard with those tools.",0
227,We have been giving the show some leeway here and there all this time. I believe we could do it once more.,1
228,"I mean, as much as it follows science, it isn't realistic what they are doing. It's all possible but not plausible. The science parts are correct but there is no way you could do all these things with such ease. Still love the shit out of it.",1
229,"Everything is turned up to 11 in Dr. Stone. Making the things they make with the relative ease they do is as reasonable for Senku as the insane feats of stamina, strength, and agility we see from Taiju, Tsukasa, or Kohaku. I think part of the reason they're so unreasonable is to make Senku and his shenanigans seem more plausible. In other words, inventing glasses is no more unreasonable than punching a lion to death.",0
230,"Yeah, it's a shounen after all.",1
231,Pretty much. They have the superpower of engineering.,1
232,It's an anime,2
233,"I mean yea ofc, but that's not the point. My point was that this was a very deliberate choice because actually making glasses is heinously difficult and there's no way senku doesn't know basic optics lol.",0
234,"Even if the prescription isn't up to today's standards, with a vision as bad as Suika's, even grossly-made lenses would make a huge difference. As for the 1080p sunflower, that's just creative license; like how the actual light emitted by the bamboo lightbulb filament 2 episodes ago would've been no stronger than a torch.",1
235,"That's not how light works. Just because they're grossly made doesn't mean they'll help, if the angle of refraction is super inconsistent on the lense, or the focal point is completely off where it should be then the image will be super fucked. Two incredibly hard things to predict and accurately achieve in the stone world. It's not a matter of bad medium and good, it's a matter of literally wouldn't be useable lol. There's a reason why glasses weren't invented until 1290 even though the study of opticslenses has been done since Mesopotamia.    This is unarguably something that's meant to be overlooked because nitpicking only takes away from the enjoyment of the scene.",1
236,     But lenses had been invented way before so the reason wasn't that making good lenses was impossible,0
237,"Making lenses ≠ making glasses. To make glasses, you have to be able make a very specific lense to fit the individual.",1
238,"Man ... We get it. We're trying to say that for the show to stay entertaining, they need to make some shortcuts.",1
239,This comment will be coming up every episode at this rate I can assure you all,1
240,"The show requires a great deal of leeway. It's not like the things they're doing aren't possible, but on the timescale they're accomplishing them on? That's pretty much impossible.    But hey, it's animation. Dimensional compression is a common trope. For example, the Simpsons compresses space so that the family can reach any iconic American landscape with no more than a day of drivingskateboarding.",1
241,"Suika's glasses are probably not perfect, but even badly fitted ones are better than no glasses at all.",0
242,They might not be perfect but they were pretty damn accurate if the show is to be trusted. It's just one of those things you aren't supposed to nitpick because it's irrelevant to the enjoyment of the show. I was just tryna say in the more meta sense that making the glasses was incredibly deliberate.,1
243,We're talking about a show where a guy can cut down a tree with one swipe of a stone knife.  I'm not going to get on their case about grinding lenses.,0
244,"That's literally not the point of my comment though. Ofc it's exaggerated I read the manga I understand how exaggerated these things are, I study electrical engineering I actually know the physics. I'm just tryna say this was a very deliberate decision to help suika and not a byproduct of convenience.",1
245,"It's just a bit exaggerated is all, for dramatic effect. It's like the lightbulb scene, where for a brief moment a single piece of bamboo with a current running through it lit up the entire night sky like a skyscraper. At a later point in the show they even acknowledge that that wasn't really how bright it actually was, it just ""felt"" like it was that bright to everyone there, because of how incredible it was for there to be any electricity at all.    Same with Suika here. Imagine spending your whole life not being able to see anything except what's immediately in front of your face, then all of a sudden you can see two feet in front of your face.  You would cry too.",0
246,"Why do you guys keep trying to tell me this. I read the manga no shit it's exaggerated. I understood that, literally all I'm saying is senkus decision to help suika is completely intentional and shows how much Senku cares about others without explicitly stating it.  As well as nitpicking this show for details is dumb as shit lol.    Yes I have experienced this exact same feeling. I use glasses lol.",1
247,Making the clear glass itself is crazy difficult as well. Glasmaking is closer to an art than it is a science.,0
248,Which is precisely why Kaiseki exists. He’s the artisan.,2
249,"Sure it would be a lot of effort to grind the glass down, but they aren't opposed to grueling manual labor to get what they want. Making the other glass stuff would require artisan skills, however, which they lacked.",1
250,"That's not my point. First of all, I've said it in like 8 different comments this is meant to be overlooked and nitpicking it removes from the enjoyment of the scene. As well as showing how much Senku actually cares about others without explicitly saying it. Because ultimately this was a very deliberate choice to help Suika.    Second of all, it's not a matter of effort it's a matter of it would be straight up useless. Making glasses is literally just as hard as any of the other artisan glass work. Just fucking grinding down a glass sheet isn't gonna give you a working usable lens lol.",1

That he's hopeful, eternally and with a ""we can do it with a bit of science"" attitude. Not happy go lucky but just... hopeful.    That's so refreshing.",1
264,"Which is soooo much more the real spirit of a scientist than the ""loner genius"" so many series have. Science has always been built off the backs and the works of others in the scientific community.",0
265,"Exactly. No man is an island and Dr. Stone proves that, every time that Senku while he can survive barely on his own, he needs his comrades to  succeed ",1
266,"ya and when old man Kaseki shows up. This is the main reason why Tsukasa plan is bound to failure.

315,"Something that I love about this story: despite being about science and technology, it has absolutely no bias against the people who grew without them. It loves and respects human ingenuity and thus gives credit to how it flourishes in all conditions - proportionately to the circumstances, of course. Some villagers may be superstitious or close-minded, but what we see mainly is characters like Chrome, who's inquisitive and creative, or Kaseki, who's achieved mastery in his craft through hard work and experience. These characters are treated with utter respect and admiration. Senku happens to be the one holding the knowledge, but they're not any less 'geniuses' than he is - each in his own field.     Reminds me of something I read recently in Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", in which he says that if anything he had the impression the people he met from hunter-gatherer tribes were  more  smart than the average first world citizen because for them using their intelligence to catalogue and understand the world on a daily basis is a matter of survival. It's very common for people to grow too proud of the technological terrors we've created ahem... and start looking at humans from the past as if they all were simpletons compared to us. But the truth is, they were humans like us, they just didn't get to start from the shoulders of giants like us. Things that today seem trivial were stupendously hard to think of if you had absolutely nothing to go off as a starting point.",1
316,Dr. Stone is basically a celebration of humanity.,2
317,"This is, in a nutshell, what I really like about this show.",1
318,"Both Chrome and Kaseki are great for what they are. Chrome being a very primitive scientist by just throwing things into a fire and seeing what happens, and Kaseki being the perfect engineer who will say ""I have no clue what you're doing, but I can tell from here you're doing it wrong.""",1
319,"        Imagine how it would be to need glasses in the stone age...      For people like Suika in the stone world must have lived their entire lives the normal state of the world is blurry.     That everyone relied more on their ears and nose than their eyes to understand their surroundings than just try to make sense of the blurry shapes people and objects are.     You don't know why, but no one else struggles as much as you to find fruits or follow a path, you must think everyone else is gifted or you were born naturally stupid since you struggle with things everyone else can easily do.    That compared to others, you were not dependable to do a task.    Suddenly you discover your eyes were at fault and that the world is INCREDIBLY MORE DETAILED than how you saw it, and tasks that you struggled with suddenly became very basic.    It must be a kind of experience that redefines your whole concept of the world.            This is one of the moments where deus ex machina is used to get the story to a convenient point:      Glass-making is a difficult skill that takes years to master.    Kaseki was able to make professional-tier glass at the first try, and even knew how to properly handle glass cooling shaping process even if he never worked with it. Clay pottery is completely different than glass-making so his previous experience should not be relevant here.",0
320,"Well, to be honest as much as the show tries to, the show won't really be that realistic.    So many small things, like for example how he poured the piping hot mix into bamboo how doesn't that burn? and how all the materials he needs are close to him, are just not possible IRL.    But I like it that way, it wouldn't be interesting otherwise.    If it was a real life situtation, even the smartest human on earth wouldn't be able to restore all of humanities scientific achievements in one life span",1
321,"It's shounen so it gets a pass imo. Plus, Tsukasa freaking punching a grown-ass LION to death was basically the writer saying,""Yeah this mangaanime is based on Science and all, buuuuut it's a shounen too, you know. Gotta keep it shounen-ey"".    Still love this series a lot, though.",0
322,"     Aside from, you know, Senku nonstop and accurately counting seconds for thousands of years in the first episode.",2
323,"That's the catch though. There have been some geniuses who can actually count a lot. For example, those Guinness World Record holders. Senku being a genius or rather the ""smartest man of the world"" would likely pull off such a feat.      Plus I like to believe that Senku's counting is wayyyyy off. Like it's not actually 3700 years, but somewhere around 3000 to 4000 years.",1
324,"won't we be able to get an accurate measure of time passed with some basic maths? Iirc the Earth cycles through an axial tilt of 22 and 24.5 degrees in a 40000 year cycle. So Senku can just measure the current angle of axial tilt, compare it with pre-petrification tilt and work out the time passed using the data.",2
325," NASA wants to know your location       Okay on a serious note, this is precisely what should have been done in the story. The writer probably just wanted to show us how much of a genius Senku is by that counting.      Plus I think Senku mentions this while looking for directions and stuff. So there's that.",1
326,yeah that's where I got the idea from. I think Senku himself recalculated after he realized about the shift in axial tilt.,1
327,"Both you and uhoverx1 are missing the point for  why  Senku wanted an accurate measure of time. If he were to survive at all as the only man alive, he needed to wake up in  spring . If he woke up in winter it would be the end of the story flat out.     There's no way for Senku to measure the angle of axial tilt while being petrified. And even if he could there's no way for that to be accurate to the  day  instead of the year.     His counting has to be very precise for the story to even begin. His margin of error can't be larger than a few weeks at most.",0
328,"Nope, you are the wrong one here. Senku waking up during spring was pure coincidenceluck. It's not like he depetrified of his own volition, his stone armor wore out and cracked  coincidentally  during spring.",0
329,"That's not what I'm arguing. Yes it's coincidence when he broke free, but he didn't know how he was going to break free. For Senku, if it were just up to chance which he doesn't know, then it doesn't matter if he counted or not because he can't control when he would wake up. If there was anything he could do himself, such as through sheer willpower, he  must not  try to break free during fallwinter. Any attempts to break free from his part  must  occur during spring. And thus he needs a measure of time accurate down to the weeks at least.     Rewatch episode 1 from 10:30-11:58 or manga ch1 pg 42-43",1
330,I did read the manga and I do know why Senku counted. I'm just showing how Senku can reconfirm his calculations.,2
331,Okay now I get your point.,1
332,"And also, Senku needed a reason to stay awake. When he partitioned his mind I think all Senku did was just go over all his experiments, theories and learnings over and over that's why he almost knows everything.",2
333,"That's my theory as well. Senku has no proof to support his year count, and he probably lost consciousnessfell asleep for a few hundred years in total because the mind needs sleep even when the body isn't tiring. He didn't have any way of knowing if he did fall asleep or it was an almost IMO.",1
334,"I dunno about the lion.    Legends say Samson slayed a lion with his bare hands. But then again, it's the bible...",2

339,"Yeah but even Samson wrestled with it or something, IIRC. Tsukasa just one-punched it into a tree.",1
340,"Easy, Tsukasa is a Pillar Man",1
341,We got a legend in America about some guy who lived in Appalachia back during the colonial era who would knife fight with bears for fun. Tsubasa should have at least hit the lion with a rock or something.,1
342,Legend also says that Samson got his divine strength from God himself and that he was only as weak as a regular man if his hair were to be cut. Also Samson wrestled the lion and strangled it to death rather than punch it.,0
343,"The way I see it, the processes are all very grounded in reality and plausibility. And the buck stops there. Availability, convenience, and in particular  human  limitations are not factors.",0
344,"Yeah, in the end it's still a work of fiction, and thus will have to take some liberties with reality. Like, even if you know the correct mixture glass is still a pain in the ass to make from scratch, especially the crystal clear, modern stuff Senku just made.    If any of the ingredients he used had even a small amount of impurity very likely since he's just digging it out of the ground it'd have either ruined the entire batch, such as making it very hard to mold or unable to cool without crackingwarping, or be colored. Either way would make it unfit for ocular lenses.",1
345,           i totally was expecting green glass.,2

349,"Yeah exactly, we have to take some creative liberties into account.",1
350,"I can speak as someone who never wore glasses my whole life until recently.  I always had issues focusing but it wasnt something glasses could fix when i was born my eyes were shaking non stop for a couple days which likely caused the focusing problem, but otherwise i could see well.  I had 2020 vision technically speaking.      Then when i was like 27 i think, i started having my vertigo attacks and went to a eye doc and neurologist to try to figure out what was happening.  This was before we knew anything about it other than, my vision starts spinning randomly  for about 30 seconds every couple months.  Well they were not sure of the spinning vision issue, but they decided to check my eyes and see if glasses helped since i never wore any.  They found a few odd things about my eyes, i have high eye pressure meaning in likely to develop glaucoma, high sensitivity to light, 2 forms of colorblindness, im missing a lot of nerve fibers in my eyes like 90% of the fibers are not there yet im not blind, and for some reason my eyes are biologically asymmetrical which they said just doesnt happen in humans as eyes are the same genetically which this means my eyes fight for dominance and eventually one will wear out and lose and go blind.  What they also found out though is that due to my eyes being like they were from 2 different people, they had 2 entirely different internal workings which was causing me some minor seeing issues.  They corrected this by giving me 2 entirely different glasses lenses.  It took 3 pair to get it down though over the course of 8 years.      So the first pair of glasses they gave me were +0.05  -0.05 which is the lightest prescription they have because i have 2020 vision but the important thing this did was correct the discrepancy in my eyes.  One lens is slightly forward and one is slightly backwards.  This initially solved the core issue of them being slightly different.  This also was a massive improvement on my ability to see, everything looked way crisper than it ever did before since they were now closer to seeing the same thing.  I remember the first day i got those glasses my eyes couldnt stop watering from all the new information they were getting, they were being overwhelmed and it really made a huge difference.  I had gone 27 years seeing the same, well enough but not quite great either, and then all of a sudden could see way more than i could before, it was such an incredible experience.  But that wasnt fully it.      I had those glasses from 2012 to 2016, but in 2016 i felt they were not quite perfect yet as i struggled to read signs and i was about to goto Japan for a month, so i went back and had them check and update them.  They found that while the small +- they had was right, my eyes still were not quite the same seeing and that i also had astigmatism in both eyes.  So the new pair were to correct that.  It took me like 12 days to adjust to these new glasses.  My head was killing me and my eyes hurt looking through them, but the eye doc said they were a big change from the old ones going from nothing to astigmatism lenses.  But once i fully adjusted the day before i left, i could see even better than before.  Further away stuff was sharper and clearer, and in general i could read signs better.  Again it was a massive improvement and really made things better.  But again, that wasnt quite enough...      I had that pair from 2016 to 2019, just a little over a month ago.  Again, i felt like the old pair wasnt keeping up and things were just not quite sharp enough, and i still had some issues with signs at a distance.  So again they did the whole checkup, 8 years since the last one and im still missing nerve fibers but 0 change in 8 years so he thinks i was born missing the fibers.  After a series of testing with diff lenses and combos and stuff, he saw that the shapes of my eye lenses were not the same which means he had to change the cut of each glasses lens seperately before they were the same shape just diff angles and the new glasses felt so wrong when i first pet them on.  I spent a couple hours at the glasses place talking to the doctor there and he said the new lenses were extremely differently shaped than the old ones and my brain was not keeping up.  He said this always happens in cases like this and that it would take a while for it to adjust.  Basicly my vison was skewed and fish eyed with the glasses on and lagging movement wasnt smooth.  He said to give them time if i could take it, so i decided to wait and see.  1 week, still wonky.  2 weeks, still wonky.  3 weeks, slightly better.  4 weeks, way better.  Now, perfect.  It took over a month for my brain to adjust.      The difference though is insane.  I can see so much better now than i ever could before.  I can see so much detail and sharpness from 10 feet away, 20 feet, even like 50 feet, everything is so clear and sharp.  Its so wierd looking though because my depth perception is wonky in general, so sometimes everything is so clear it looks like a flat image.  Which is scarey as hell.  But its crazy to be able to see so well now.  I cant even remember what the world looked like before glasses but i just know that i feel like i can truely see now.  So going for like 27 years without knowing you were not seeing right is just such a huge life changer.  Everyone should get thier eyes looked at because its impossible to know if you see the same as everyone else, and you might not be seeing right.  Let a professional find out, and even if it takes a couple tries like me, stick with it, because in the end it will change your life.  Here i am, mid 30s and can finally see after all these years.       glasses-push",1
351,I will now picture you with permanently spinning eyes every time I read your comments.    Amazing that you basically upgraded your vision 3 times though!,1
352,"When i was born they were going side to side, and when i have my vision attacks everything spins around sideways too.  But more or less the same haha.      And yeah it took a while to narrow it down due to the odd nature of my eyes but they finally sorted it out it seems.  The newest glasses are such a huge improvement over the others.  Its good to finally have it down though.",1
353,"I made a joke but yikes, that sounds 20x more annoying and debilitating than when I had random dizzy vertigos, great that you sorted it out.      Did you ever solve your colour weakness? This episode also reminds me about videos of colourblind people getting special glasses and seeing colors for the first time ",1
354,"Well the spinning vision hasnt been sorted yet, im seeing some other docs about it and will probably need a head scan to make more sense of it.  Its very scary though because it happens without much warning and lasts for around 20-30 seconds.  I just fear for when it eventually happens while im driving.  And yeah its super debilitating when it happens, i cant even stand, if all to the ground and struggle to keep myself upright.  Its super wierd feeling.      And my colorblindness is really bad, colors to me are very very desaturated.  I have found a ""solution"" though.  It was an idea my last VFX teacher came up with since the colorblindness was becoming an issue in art school all my work was blue or green because i couldnt tell.  His fix was to calibrate the graphics card's color settings to compensate for my color issues.  This means that i had to jack up the color until things look ""normal"".  The tricky part though was ive been colorblind my whole life so i dont know what normal is, but he spent a couple weeks with me helping me calibrate the color to get what i see as close to normal as i can.  He really opened my whole world up with that too, because its crazy how colorful the world is really.      The first time we got the color fixed up right, again i remember my eyes just watering non stop from all the new information it was getting.  Seeing real colors for the first time in my life was one of the most life changing events ever.  Like its crazy to think how people could life without it for so long.      There is 1 catch though to this solution.  Its made me incredibly dependant on computers.  I dont much care for the real world because its very gray to me, but the world i see through my computer screen is full of so much color.  So i tend to spend all my time on the computer.  And when my graphics card updates and resets the color settings, im always shocked how different it looks.  I spend so much time in front of the computer that i tend to forget im colorblind.  Again its a bad issue but im happy so it doesnt matter.      Acctually recently my brother tried to help some too.  I managed to buy a nice expensive poster printer for extremely cheap like a year ago, and my bother helped me calibrate the color on that too so i can print posters that are tuned for my colorblindness like my computer it.  It means i can have colorful stuff in the real world too.  It took a while to get setup right and a lot of trial and error but we finally found the right boost that i could see well.  Ive printed a lot of stuff on it but havent hung any of it up yet because my house is in a state right now, were trying to clear out my grandparents stuff and sort it to make the house liveable, so until then im not putting them up, but once the house is sorted ill put them on the walls.  It will be interesting to see what people think seeing them haha.      But yeah i hope that answers your question.  I went on a ramble.",1
355,"     Whoa, dude. You don't happen to be one of the 30-100 confirmed cases of human chimerism, do you?",2
356,"No clue, didnt know that was a word thing until now.      I had heard about people being like twins with themselves or such, which i think was one of the theories the eye doc had for why my eyes were different.      With me its hard to say because i have 2 skin tones and 2 hair tones I always said i was half ginger because i have a lot of ginger features mixed in normal ones.  Also my body is in general very asymmetrical.  Like my face looks like 2 entirely diff people from the left or right, also both my arms and my torso is different and one leg is a little diff.  That said, i did break my spine when i was like 5 or 6, i fell out of a tree i climbed to the top of, and then when i was like 8 or 9 i fell off a cliff, and when i was like 14 i fell off a second story of a house.  So ive had a lot of bad falls that might have just fucked my body shape up.      Even still though i do have 2 hair colors so my base hair is brown but i have red stripes in my hair kinda like a cat with stripes, my hair just isnt 1 color currently its 3 beacuse the red is going white lately.  Also my beard is 3 colors, red in the middle, brown on the sides, and white mixed in.  In addition as i said my skin is super weird, i have generally tan skin tone but i also am covered in freckles that are almost the exact same tone as my skin so you dont see them unless you get close.  Oh and my eyes are almost every color.  The edges are Blue, the middles are green, and the centers are brown, and not like a gradient, its splochy.      So yeah its hard to say whats up with me.  I think i just had some wierd genetic trait bug that caused the hair and complexion stuff and probably the eye stuff too.",1
357,"I don't have anything nearly as crazy as you.    Short version of the story is that I never bothered to get glasses because my vision was ""good enough"" for day to day things. Sometimes I'd get headaches, especially when dealing with small things, but it wasn't a big deal. My right eye was blurry, but trying the glasses of all my immediate family every one of them has glasses just hurt my vision.    Eventually I got my eyes checked out. Come to find out I have severe keratoconus in my right eye, meaning that my cornea the ""lens"" of the eye is a cone instead of a dome making it so that my eye is incapable of focusing properly and glasses can't help.     There are two solutions.    The first is a cornea transplant. It's expensive, can cause scaring, and only lasts 15 years at best.    The second is Rigid Gas-Permeable RGP contact lenses. They're also pretty expensive. If you're like me and your condition is extreme enough you have to go for the larger scleral meaning it rests on the whites of the eyes and not the cornea, take this picture for example.     Anyway. Point is that eyes are crazy, but crazy things can be done to fix them.",0
358,"Jesus your eye thing sounds rough.      I cant handle touching my eyes or seeing people touch thiers, i have a very big phobia of things going in my head like eye drops or ear drops or nose spray or stuff.  I tried contacts once and it took me like an hour to get both in, i was like ""nope.""  haha.  And when i goto the doctor it takes people holding me down to do eyedrops or ear drops or stuff.  When my throat swelled shut 10 years ago, i was taken to the ER but i could still barely breath, and that was a whole other ordeal, but eventually the docs after trying everything else to fix it including like 10 shots they had to hold me down for they decided to shove a tube down my throat to force it open.  They had to get like 3 big nurses to hold me down when they did that because i wasnt letting them put that tube down my throat.  They eventually did it and in the process shredded my vocal chords so now i have trouble talking ever since and if hurts to talk after a little bit.  Ive just been traumatized by that sort of stuff i think that now i have a crazy phobia of them.  I dont even like being in hospitals after that.  Also when i gets shots or IVs now i freak out.  its rough haha.",0
359,yeah im not gonna argue with you. This is really deus ex machina. Not forced but necessary for the plot. Y'know if inagaki decides for the plot for them to realestically take months lmao we have a corpse ruri.,1
360,I've actually had lazy eye right eye since birth and nearsightedness on both for as long as I can remember but never got them corrected until I was 14. I only ever got them diagnosed at that age cause I brought it up with my mom how my eyesight feels like it's getting worse but apparently it was already really bad. Getting new glasses was like seeing a whole new world that I never knew could be that clear since the blurry one has been totally the norm for me. I've been stuck with really high prescription glasses since 8 years now and no particular changes. The optometrist said it could've been corrected if it had been treated way earlier. Kinda really shows how bad my communication was if it took that late to find out. Often times people would misunderstand that I was glaring at them back then too. Yeah. Random thing I feel I had to type out since this episode kinda speaks to me. Thanks for reading.,0
361,"Yeah, the show has an issue with experiencetime and irl phenomenons. But honestly, having a guy to break stones with a punch and a MC that was conscious for 3 thousand years, is it really worth to raise such obvious point? The guy is supposed to make a drug to cure somebody else illness and he's not even a doctor, I mean he doesn't know if it's a virus or a bacteria, the daily doses and all of that stuff, he knows science and how the technique work not the specialty, although of course the show will make he do things conveniently because nobody else would do it in the first place either the MC or a random support character.    The main premise is that one person would never ""accelerate an era"", we know that, and the anime makes it possible anyways, so deus ex machina is the only way to make the plot going otherwise the show needs to make a new cast for every generation and that's not viable at all.",1
362,"     This actually makes sense.    What Senku is doing as said on previous episodes is a sulfa drug, antibiotics.    The one Senku wants to do is a simple one, but it's an antibiotic nonetheless. While it's not guarantee to cure Ruri's illness, there is a high chance a super-potent medicine like that for stone world standards will help her in some way.",1
363,"I'm willing to let that slide. Senku knows everything he needs to know about glassblowing, he just doesn't have the dexterity he needs to do it. I just write it off as the old guy being a fast learner.",2
364,"Come on. We can't hand on the ""glass blowing takes years to master"" thing  now . The show has a guy who can keep count of every second for over 3000 years with perfect timing while keeping all of human scientific knowledge in his head, a guy who can one-punch lions to death, and another who has infinite stamina. Having another genius craftsman who can grasp the properties of a material and instantly perfect the manufacturing process is kind of along the theme of this show.",1
365,"Suika's situation was quite lovely to see. Reminds me of my older sister, for a long while my sister had trouble reading subtitles if she didn't stay near the TV when we watched anime together and actually thought she was dyslexic. Turns out she was just short sighted lol, I made fun of her so much for that. There's just something amazing about realizing ""oh, so that's the reason why stuff is like this for me all this time?"" Like when I found out I was lactose intolerant...",1

367,"I still drink the shit out of milk because I'm not about to stop now, but I always know in the back of my mind ""there will be consequences later""",1
368,I used to drink milk more than water but it started giving me problems so I stopped for like 3 yrs now,2
369,That's kind of amazing. I have no self control so 3 yes is quite something.,1
370,"Thanks, I think its mostly due to me being diagnosed with celiac around that time :",1
371,"Oof, that's quite the bothersome condition to have, good luck",1
372,"Same here, I started having issues with milk and coffee, went to the doc, confirmed that I was intolerant but continued to drink regardless, a few years later had to stay in the hospital for a few days and was diagnosed with crohn's. It get's pretty bad when I drink milk or coffee for some reason.    Now that I think of it it was super dumb to continue to drink since milk without lactose tastes pretty much the same. Ironically my neighbour had the exact same issue but for a different reason, the guy worked at burger king, so he ate hamburgers for a whole year, then he also was diagnosed with it.    If something you're eating is messing with your body just find a replacement, nowadays there's replacements for everything that taste the same.",1
373,I'll definitely keep that in mind,1
374,Have you ever tried lactose-free milk? It’s a little bit sweeter but it’s still milk,2

408,Ive been working in front of the computer since ive graduated. Slowly my eyes deteriorated without me realizing until the day i had a free eye examination trial and eventually bought glasses. I never realized how bad my eyesight is when i went out of the shop i spent hours reading signages and looking at the surrounding everything looks HD its like comparing 2008 youtube to 2018 youtube quality. I felt regret for abusing my eyes when i was young.,1
409,"i remember a quote from Sunkenrock manga ""The only thing we truly own in this world is our body""",1
410,"My parents were always saying that my eyes would get bad because I spend 12+ hours a day in front of screens for more than 20 years and I barely rest I work in digital art, I just didn't care to be honest. Perfect eyesight. Not saying it's not harmful, but I have to agree that it's not the main issue.",1
411,"Genetics are not the reason people need glasses, its environmental circumstances. In the last 100 or so years cultures that spend the majority of their time indoors started developing eye problems, like China. This only applies to nearsightedness though which is by far the most common defect.",0
412,"Genetics plays a role, but environment absolutely plays a role, as well. Sure, some are predistined for nearsight or farsight, but the same goes for musculature: some dudes are just huge no matter, what, and some dudes are just scrawny no matter what.    But for most of us, our habits absolutely will influence our eyesight. A lot of close work will adjust our eyes to nearer sight. A lot of far work shooting or throwing balls or whatever will adjust them to farther sight. It's no different from any other part of the body: our body has the ability to adapt within certain constraints, so if you're sitting in front of the computer all day every day, your eyes will adapt to suit.    I'm nearsighted, but I used to wear glasses when doing close work that actually adjust it to make it like I'm working farther away. Years of doing this adjusted my sight to the point where I no longer needed glasses to pass the DMV eye exam. Then three years ago my niece scratched up my glasses, and I haven't had the money to buy new ones well, I guess I could find the money, but I just haven't done it. Now my vision is decaying, once again, to the point where I'm going to need glasses to pass that exam. But I'm pretty sure all I really need is those reading glasses, and my vision should recover.",1
413,I used to sit in front of the computer all the time. My parents just asking me to take a damm rest for some time but I just didn't used to care now I have got my glasses because I can't even clearly see from even 5 feet. I regret abusing my eyes too. It's so amazing putting on glasses for the first time and seeing the daily things look so much crisper and clearer. Truly mankind's greatest invention.,1
414,Well that certainly was a unique explanation for the melon.      Well I hope Kinro actually manages to come past his sight disability and actually whop Magma's ass.      And there goes Senku again with his inability to just let a touching moment lie with his assertion that Suika's labor output is increased now.      This old man Kaseki is like Master Roshi meets Hephestus. And yet another person who has truly impressed Senku in this stone world.      And here's Mecha Senku again with his powers of exposition.      Well if nothing else them having their gold and silver spears may give them a psychological edge.,1
415,That moment where Suika’s eyes got blurry for a different reason after getting glasses was so heartwarming. God this show is great.,1
416,"ooooh, that was pretty clever in the opening to show suika around the sunflowers with her new glasses shining from the light without spoiling this part.     kudos to the anime team",1
417,"Wow, I actually managed to miss the flare of her glasses in the opening. That is a nice touch.",1
418,"Yes, I noticed that as well after watching the episode!",1
419,"Damn, first Joshikousei no Mudazukai and now Dr. Stone with surprisingly wholesome moments.    Also subbed OP and ED!",0
420,"These two show are suppose to make me laugh, not cry. 100 billion percent loving it though",1
421,Why'd they take so long for them to sub the OpED,2
422,"I think it has to do with the rights for the music itself from the publisher, which are very different from the rights for the anime.    ",2
423,"and I was precisely thinking this week : ""they didn't speak about the bad eye-sight problem, looks like everyone is fine in this stone world, not so realistic in the end"" ... and here we go : this week they reveal someone whas bad eye sight and Senku re-creates glass and glasses. I love this.The gramp transformation was hilarious. Furthermore, you feel that Boichi behind Senku's voice is a real admirer of craftsmen.    Great episode.",1
424,"     The writer is Inagaki-sensei, same author as Eyeshield 21. Boichi only draws the art.",2
425,Boichi also conveys mad respect to Kaseki by making him fuckin  ripped. ,2
426,     I didn't know. Thank you.,0
427,This freaking got me.,0
428,"""Mandom""",2
429,"When I stub my pinky toe on the bed, but the feeling doesn't hit right away",1
430,I was looking for a gif of that. Thank you.,1
431,This show makes me feel bad for taking what we consider small common things for granted.,0
432,"They're going for thicker outlines now, mimicking the progression of the manga. Very nice. Also DAT SOUNDTRACK",1
433,I suspected Suika was a girl by the separation between the eyes of her melon.,0
434,underrated comment,2
435,Yep I had a lazy eye when I was super young and got an amazingly well done surgery at 6 yrs old. Im thankful for that.,1
436,Holy shit that sounds like one of my eyes I should go to the doctor,0
437,"I know that feel Suika. When I was young I though shit was blurry for everyone. I take my glasses for granted now but I was so excited to get them as a kid.    Senku be like,    ""Yeah you don't have to help us but look at all this cool shit we have that you've never seen before.""    Kaseki is here! Now things get real good.",1
438,"What really hit me hard, even more than making glasses for the girl, was when Senku straight up told her her eyesight wasn't even a problem, nor a defect.    It really put it into perspective how many disabilities we have as humans that we just handwave away, and that's just fucking amazing. But more important is how Senku doesn't look down on people for those issues, or see them as any less of a human being.",1
439,Even with the old man he didn't really get on his case. He knew he had the potential to be the craftsman they need but just wanted to goad him into action. All this guy needs is an anvil and he can make fine weapons that the stone world has yet to behold.,0
440,Finally! Ma boi Kaseki for the win!,1
441,Suika being cute in OP    Sunflowers in the opening song -- now you know!,1
442,The opening does this a lot.,2
443,OMG SUIKA IS SO FUCKIN    nevermind,2
444,SUIKAAAAAAAaaaaaa TT    I loved that the part with the sunflowers they don't say anything. They just... they just stand there looking.,1
445,"Did they change Director for the episode? This ep was way better than previous ones! Pacing, osts, visuals.. Good job!",1
446,I noticed it too. The animation quality and pacing is juust right.  The characters looked well adapted from the manga. And it covers 2 manga chapters only compared to the the other episodes,1
447,Noticed it as well. I felt it took the show from like an A- to an A+,1
448,"If we're talking about pacing, that Kingdom of Science was expanded from the manga tho, filling in the gaps so that we'll reach that cliffhanger with that actual use of silver.",1
449,Senku seeing the lab and remembering his own lab when he was a kid was emotional as hell for me,0
450,"It seems like he didn't want to show how goddamn happy he was, but it was easy to tell that this was probably the happiest he had been since he got busted out of the rock.",1
451,Suika seeing Chrome and Senku clearly then getting blurred again now because of tears building up on her eyes from the overflowing emotion of seeing clearly again hits the feels,1
452,"Man the craftsman bit is speaking to my heart. This fucking anime man, i love it",1
453,Besto boy,2
454,This show really puts into perspective just how amazing the things we take for granted really are.,1
455,"Great episode. Senku's genuine joy at giving Suika the glasses is so good. It's not his usual smug, triumphant happy. He's genuinely thrilled to have made her life better.",1
456,"""There's people like you in every era"", Senku was talking about his dad, right?    What a damn good episode.",1
457,"Not sure how it would relate to his dad, who AFAIK had no talent to speak of other than being a great dad.",1
458,Huh. Might be wrong then. Senku looked very proud and I just assumed he was seeing one his father's qualities in the old man.,1
459,I'm glad someone else noticed it. I think you should look at the lyrics of the ED,1
460,When did senku say that?,2
461,Didn't really say it.,2
462,It's not the  talent  that Senku was admiring. It's the dedication.,1
463,"He specifically referred to ""talented individuals"" who yes had dedication.",1
464,"Yes, but that skill isn’t inborn. It’s forged through hard work, repetition, and sheer passion.",1
465," ""Lol no XD. You'll see...""",1
466,"Weirdly enough I had the same thought as you watching the episode. I read the manga up to a point and don't think he ever meant anything about his dad by that at least reading the part on its own, but I guess we both thought it was his dad because the dad seemed awesome and dedicated.",1
467,There's always someone like you.,1
468,Nani? Not our gorilla?,2
469,She's someone way stronger than Gorilla.,1
470,Two blonde gorillas?  :o,0
471,Nope,2
472,"Each week we're getting a new best girl or best boy. I'm not complaining tho, keep them coming !",1
473,She indeed as the inherent characteristic of all best girls : she doesn’t exist.,1
474,"Man, that moment with Suika finally being able to see properly was really heartwarming. And I've been thinking this for a couple of weeks actually, that in a world without glass I'd be useless. Honestly having myopia and astigmatism sucks",1
475,Suika is freaking damn cute     uwaa,0
476,  Cuteness Overload,1
477,"Another enjoyable episode!    I actually love that Senkuu couldn't do the glass making. A very realistic storyline of him of course not being a master at everything.    OMG, total shipping Senkuu and Kohaku! When she said his ""ten billion percent"" while talking the same way as him, that was so cute.",1
478,"Right, having the knowledge of how things work and having the  skill  to pull it off are two very different things.",2
479,"First off, Suika is absolutely the cutest child in anime I've ever seen. I like that she doesn't have the typical superloli voice and actually seems like a child and well, not a Loli. When her newfound clear sight went blurry mine did too.     Senku's reaction faces are my favorite part of the show. Actually, he's just a beautiful dude in general. The character designs are great especially Tsukasa. Maybe JoJo does make you gay...hmmmm. Everyone has God tier reaction faces. Kohaku is peak blonde waifu god damn do I love her. I tend to end up liking the characters names Kohaku in shows.    This show feels like a but of a slow burn but it's good!",1
480,Finally I can praise the OP for teasing Suika's lenses with that little glint in the light,1
481,"I thought they were just gonna make glasses and ditch the watermelon head, but they just put the glass into the watermelon! WE GOT THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME!",1
482,It was explained in the manga that melon helmet was just for prototype but Suika is so used to wearing that she’s fine as it is.,1
483,So what do you guys think the girl's disease is? Tuberculosis?,2
484,the dreaded japanese cold,0
485,"She's not 100% bedridden, so no.",0
486,"The one You can catch after standing for at least 1 second in the rain, right? Dang it, heard it's hella dangerous. Poor thing...",0
487,Lupus,2
488,It's never Lupus.,2
489,Except for that one time when it was Lupus.,2
490,"With lupus you would see a butterfly rash and an aversion to sunlight. As far as I am aware, coughing is a major symptom.",0
491,"It’s not a good idea to ask for people to throw around guesses, when many like myself red the manga. You should google what are the most common diseases people used to get before modern medicine, with what we know from Ruri’s condition, or a ask a friend in med school what he thinks.",1
492,"Measles, smallpox, polio? All diseases easily preventable by vaccinations. Remember kids, vaccinate.",1
493,We killed smallpox. Humanity defeated it just as we defeated the night.,0
494,"From previous episodes flashbacks of her and Chrome as kids it seems like she has had it for at least 6+ years. Chrome asked her ""the usual stuff?"" so maybe she has had it her whole life",1
495,"If it's TB she's a goner, sulfonamides won't help either.",0
496," ""this is Senku's greatest fear, and he addresses it later on.""",1
497,"Either the episode was really fun or my depression weakened. Either way, I laughed several times just before Senku laughed and it was kinda ""embarrassing""",1
498,"This episode  is well animated. The characters are nicely drawn. The Kingdom of Science attractions are well adapted from the manga, the extra highlight on on each attraction is so good",1
499,No one's going to mention Ginro's tongue was a mini Ginro when talking about silver and gold spears?,0
500,Scummy snake tongue,2
501,"Every single week, it gets more and more tempting to just dive into the manga.",2
502,"I always thought that was the point of most anime, to get people to read the source. Don't fight it if you don't have to.",1
503,Generally yes and certainly in the case of Dr. Stone. Since it's still airing I think it's important to point out Demon Slayer as an exception though.,1
504,Yep the Demon Slayer Manga has very average art compared to the anime,1
505,  PROTECC SUIKA  ,2
506,"this is a brilliant episode. one of the most magical moments yet with Suika seeing clearly,  AND  badass best boy Kaseki is finally introduced.     feelsgoodman",1
507,"Best girl with best scene for me has finally happened. Detective Suika is so precious, but I'm now excited for second best girl to enter the scene next episode.",1
508,"Are you talking  ""'the green fairy?'""",2
509,Yes I am.,1
510,LITTLE GIRL SEES SUNFLOWER FOR THE FIRST TIME EMOTIONAL,1
511,"When I was asked what I wanted to be as a child my answer was always the same, a scientist. As I grew older and realized how much hard work goes into it I changed my mind, but one thing stayed the same:     I still worship scientists and science itself.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming to be really smart or anything. I just really like it and left unchecked, I can end up gushing about something I saw on youtube that I found really interesting for way longer than I should.    Which is why I love Dr. Stone so much. It's clear the author shares this worship of science to fill their story with so many genuinely informative segments. Senku himself is on his way to becoming one of my favourite anime characters ever.    It's so amazing to see how science can improve everyone's lives and maybe even better so to see how excited Chrome and especially Senku are to be doing so. I swear, I smile just as wide whenever Senku has that smug grin on his face.    I digress, I just love this pure and genuine appreciation of real science.",1
512,"           Exact same thing here. I absolutely adore everything about science, even though I could never work in that field. I can however bore my friends to death with an hour long monologue about some awesome scientific news or fact. Too bad 99% of them are not interested.. I need more ""scientist"" friends.",1
513,Aye same but I still want to be a scientist,1
514,ever since senku met chrome this show has been amazing,1
515," HOLY FUCKING MOE MELON LORD OVERLOAD        mmmmyrgh      Glass huh?  I wonder what for.  Oh for better containers.  Makes sense.      WE CAN SEE MELON LORDS FACE!? SHES SO DAMN KAWAII  KYAAAAAAAAAAA  OH GOD! HAHAHHA!      Wait she needs glasses?  Thats why she wears the melon?  MAKE HER GLASSES!  GIVE USE MEGANE MELON LORD!      So get the sand from the mountain, grind it to powder, then heat it up with calcium and seaweed?      Man all this to make Megane for Melon Lord, i love this shit.      HE PUT THE LENSES IN HER MELON!? OH MY GOD ITS AMAZING HAHAHHHA!      SHE CAN FINALLY SEE OH MAN THIS IS SO WHOLESOME!  I CANT TAKE IT   LOOK HOW HAPPY SHE IS!      Wait does Kinro need glasses too? Has distance issues?  The fuzzy sickness?  TELL HER! MAKE HIM GOLD GLASSES!      Making an obsidiant furnace for glass blowing?  Neat.  Of course none of them are good at it hahahaha.      Do we know a craftsman?  The oldman from the OP?  Oh yes!      So the oldman made the shields?  He seems to a pretty great craftsman if he had laqure too.  He made the bridge too.      They got the oldman hooked, this is great hahahahahahha  Hes got the itch.  SCRATCH IT OLDMAN!      This oldman is awesome, we got a real great asset!  Hes just like Senku, a man who loves to work.      The rock house.  The food stall.  The iron furnace.  The magnet energy generator.  The obsidian furnace.  The Laboratory.  Not bad kingdom of science, not bad at all!      I love how much the monkey cares about Science.  Hes a great friend to Senku.      Get this man some glasses!  They want a gold and silver spear though hahaha.      What does he need to make the silver spear i wonder.  Hmmmmm...      Well guess we will see next week.  Hopefully they give some Megane to guard boy so he can become a spear master.",1
516,     Senku needs more   class   cultured,2
517,"Oops, ment Glass.  Fingers are not thier best today haha.",0
518,A-Okay!        banjo,2
519,BUSTA WOLF,2
520,Damn Suika getting glasses was so great.    The last part showing off everything was a bit too filler.,1
521,"Suika finally becoming able to see reminded me of babies wearing glasses for the first time, so heartwarming :'D",1
522,years of craftsmanship reaps its rewards,1
523,"Was really wanting Senku to invent a mirror to impress them now that they have glass, but then I think silver would be needed to coat it, so let's see if it's ever brought up.",1
524,I love that scene when Kaseki and Suika are just yelling yay after finishing some glass,1
525,Didnt we all do that this episode,2
526,"TIL about lava foam glass, who knew:         ",2
527,SUIKA IS STILL THE BEST GIRL AND NONE OF YOU CAN CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE,1
528,     NICE MUSCLE!,1
529,"This is the best episode of anime I've seen in a while.    When they showed the laboratory, I alone in my room started clapping like a little kid.",1
530,Anyone else tear up during this episode?  Ahh.. fuck me.,0
531,"I love the old man so much, reminds me of my father. Doesn't matter if he's never seen the device before, he can intuit its mechanism just by looking at it. The world needs engineers who get things done as much as it needs scientists who figure out how to do things.",1
532,Besto boy Kaseki is finally here.,2
533,This and many other reasons is why I love Sukia so much. Probably my favorite character. Easily.,1
534,Watermelon child got glasses. All is good.,1
535,Almost cried when Suika was able to clearly see things,1
536,"Oh man, it was wonderful seeing this chapter adapted. I've always loved Senku and Suika's dynamic. Reminds me of a big brother who sometimes trolls his little sister but will do anything gladly for her.",1
537,Some tears were shed this episode,0
538,"Put your grasses on, nothing will be wrong  ",1
539,Very nice of Senkuu to make Suika some glass if only Kinrou would tell them that he also has fuzzy vision. The way Senkuu and Chrome tricked the old man to help them make glass was very cleaver. I wonder what Senkuu has in mind that could cost Ginrou his life.,1
540,Wait what’s the death material that they need? Mercury maybe?,0
541,"Check the roadmap from a few episodes ago, it's there.    It's  ""sulphuric acid""",2
542,Dont they already have nital though?,2
543,"It's for the medicine, they're called SULPHas after all.    Besides, they don't have Nital because Tsukasa has the bat cave.",2
544,Oh thanks! I totally forgot,1
545,Every week I get the feels and thank all the people for making my life as easier as it is today. This week was no different. Suika is so cute.,1
546,"This Anime is very good, it can hit emotions right on the spot. Thank you",1
547,Kaseki Acquired!,2
548,Suika is just goddamn perfect. Adorable doesn't even begin to describe her.,1
549,Wbat chapter is this in manga?,2
550,27-29.,2
551,Thanks,1
552, What's the material? Damm cliffhangers. I think it's Mercury but I'm not a geology guy.,2
553,"Sulfur. Senku has mentioned the name of the antibiotic they're making as being a ""sulfa drug"" and sulfur reacts very well with silver in order to make silver sulfate, which is coincidentally used in the process of silver plating.     The problem with sulfur is that the only known source of the stuff is deep within the Tsukasa Empire, that being the hot spring from earlier. Either that or they have to find another volcanic vent to gather the stuff.",0
554,"For those who wonder why Ginro might risk his life in the next episode, take a look at the main properties of silver and what it reacts to... You just might understand what Senku wants to find next.",0
555,Science!,2
556,"Well, they already said they needed sulfur hence the name ""sulfa drug"" but why is it so difficult to get, other than the main source being volcanic ash? The only real thing I can think of being that it would involve traveling deep into the Tsukasa Empire and back to the hot spring.",0
557,It's easy to guess when you remember the hazards in handling chemicals.,1
558,Suika being able to see is just so heartwarming!,1
559,I'm glad  Suika can see but I thought the point was to make it so she wouldn't have to wear that mask.  hoping he crafts some cute glasses next episode.     ;    Edit: lol I checked the manga and chrome basically says the same thing to senku I guess it's a little self aware comment by the author.,1
560,She would need a new name.  Her name is basically watermelon.,2
561,She likes the mask.,1
562,"This really makes me wonder if the world was set back to a no technology era, how long would it realistically take to rebuild modern society from the bottom up, if we all had the knowledge we currently posses.",0
563,"This Isaac Arthur video sort of discusses that topic. His viewpoint is that in most scenarios it would go very fast, a generation or two to have most of the tools fully functional, although of course rebuildinging ""all the things"" would take generations, just given the lower manpower and the time it takes to build things. It wouldn't be unlikely for a ""ground zero"" civilization to rebuild to modern standards within a few hundred years, rather than tens of thousands.",0
564,No easy to access oil tho.,1
565,"Yes, that's one of the major problems, a lot of the world's easy access materials are already used up and hard to replace. That said, in the short term, a small population could make do by using renewable energy to produce things. Not as efficient or as reliable, but they'd get work done. Assuming they had advanced scientific knowledge they could produce bio fuels too. Once you got up to mid-tier modern tech, you could start going after oil again, assuming we hadn't used  all  of it up yet. It's also possible to recycle stuff, so if plastic is still lying around, you can use that as plastic,  or  convert it back into a form of fuel.",0
566,What about 2000 years like in Dr Stone.,1
567,"Not sure. I think buried plastic would still be plastic. I think you could mine cities for it. Also, while buildings would collapse and rust, you could dig them up, and process the metals from ""city ore."" They would be different than natural ores that we're used to, but function similarly.",0
568,"I wonder what is the material Senku wants to acquire in order to make a spear. Steel perhaps? The acquirement of carbon poses no problem I guess but iron... I tried to look up where does iron ore occur naturally and I found out that it's usually near lakes or marshes. I cannot verify it, but if they were to head to a marsh I guess that could be dangerous. Or maybe they'll have to go into some kind of cave?    I don't know, I might be completely wrong about everything.",0
569,They already have iron.  They used magnets to pickup that black sand in the river.    You can't really get a lot like that but in this show when they show it once it's assumed from then on they have an infinite supply of that thing they made.,1
570,Ah right I completely forgot about that! Then I guess it'll be something else. Sorry.,0
571,My guess is that they have to go get either mercury or chlorine.,2
572,"They're going to be making acid for the sulfa drugs, so it's definitely the hardest ingredient to get. Chances are it will also have its uses in other things, which is why he promised Ginro the silver spear.",1
573,"This anime just make you feel so happy, it's the only show with this effect.",1
574,PROTECT SUIKA AT ALL COSTS,1
575,Old mate Kaseki master roshing out,2
576,"the other day I said ""10 billion percent"" about somethings and was like fuck this anime is too good it's affecting how I talk",1
577,That Suika scene was emotional and really good,1
578,The scene that Senku makes lens for Suika is more heartwarming than manga..<3,1
579,"Right before this episode, I was wondering if Suika’s full appearance would be a season- or series-long secret.",2
580,"Finally, Kaseki get! He's definitely my favorite in the series.",1
581,"Noooo, why is the episode over already? Dr. Stone is getting better and better. For a moment I tought Kaseki would be a 1st gen and, therefore, know about glasswork.",1
582,"Might as well rename the series uplighting the anime.    Also legit if anyone actually chooses the tsukasa tribe after seeing this shit, oh you can't see well you're fucked let's kill a lion lmao fuck off",0
583,Is it just me or did the animation seem way better this episode? Was smooth as hell,0
584,Yes. Artstyle did justice on boichis work,1
585,"So have a fun fact about kaseki, he is 10 billion percent accurate in the portrayal of old time craftsmen. Before the days of motorized machines all the work had to be done manually.    That means every nail hit, every saw cut, every level planed, every hole augured was done by hand.     in fact an old story goes that Leonardo Da Vinci would have this party trick were he would take out horseshoes and bend them straight over his knee.",1
586,Suika and kaseki stole the show     And kohaku taking senkus 10 billion %  was really hilarious     Kaseki reminds me of old man nakiri sanzemon  from shokugeki no souma  when his clothes get ripped of :    But what if the anime story was done from tsukasa s perspective   Will the science kingdom be hated by viewers ? Just curious :,0
587,"I got glasses early on, and at times I feel bad about them for some reason... but this episode has reminded me once again to not take my glasses or this era and it's tech for granted. And just be grateful for it since in the past some people actually had to deal with their lives with glasses when they absolutely needed it.",1
588,I wear glasses and I teared up a little when Suika could first see the world. That shit hits hard.,0
589,My secular ass is absolutely loving this show. I do wonder if they ever hit on pollution and waste. Technology is fucking great but there is no denying the damage we are currently causing to the environment. Currently they don't have near enough population to cause damage in any meaningful way but it would be nice if they at least touch on it. If the MC's goal is to bring back everyone then It has to be addressed right?,0
590,"     We get it, you're an atheist. Sir this is a Wendy's.",2
591,"     Where did you get that from?  Secular doesn't necessarily mean atheist just         The reason I put it is because Doctor Stone is a show that promotes it, beating magic and science etc, which is a nice change a pace from all the magic and power of love stuff that we see.    If I wanted to shout that I was an atheist I would of used that word.",1
592,"Then I think you don’t use the word secular correctly. Secular is part of a Binary with Spiritual, much in the same way True is part of a Binary with False. To say that an activity is secular is to explicitly state that it lacks spirituality. If you like that the show is grounded in reality, you might say it’s realistic, or perhaps plausible, or even logical.     To say Dr Stone is secular is reminiscent of scientism, the belief that science is the only absolute in the universe, hence why your phrase came off to me at least like a boastful atheist.",1
593,"     Well yeah its sorta Dr Stones thing, hence what I said. But I was not trying to be boastful just using it to point out why I am enjoying the show.",1
594,The liberal way they are using mercury and lead makes me cringe.,2
595,I don't think they have either of those.,2
596,That's why Tsukasa is in the end correct. Adults are the reason the world is in crisis.,0
597,What if elon musk did this to us... turnin everyone into stone for 3752 years... hmmm anyone have a feeling elon workin on this rn?,1
598,Melon Usk?,2
599,Selon Muk,2
600,     Elon is Suika's ancestor confirmed,2
601,"Melon Mask, the superhero of science we need",2
602,This OP and ED though... HYPE,2
603,a bit disappointing he popped the lenses in the melon instead of making a nifty pair of Senku style frames,0
604,But then Suika would lose her defining feature.,0
605,But then she can't use her powers of stealth,0
606,Kinro and Ginro are a beautiful bromance,1
607,"well they are brothers, no ?",2
608,Holy shit they are ? I probably missed when they stated they were,0
609,Example,2
610,"Brother has a different meaning in japanese, doesn't it? Anime characters call any person they like brother even if they're not actually related.",1
611,"it was only once i think, can also refer to wiki i recommend not reading too much because possible spoilers",1
612,"does anyone know for how long this show still runs? 1 episode feels to short to finish the first arc, but with 14 episodes left it's like they are going to end in the middle of the second arc",1
613,myanimelist says it will have 24,2
614,"Maybe the beginning of second arc with the ""Winter""",2
615,Finally. Nice glasses.,1
616,"Just wondering, but is the glass in glasses not a specific type of glass? And isn't there some specific way to polish said glass?     I mean this is an anime, so it's not like I'm requiring it to be 100% accurate with this shit especially given what it's about lol. Just curious.",0
617,"Not really, today we make glasses out of certain stuff mostly plastics for the safety because actual glass shattering near your eyes would be a disaster. But the optical properties of how glasses correct vision impairments are universal. You could make glasses with anything translucent really. And while there isn't a 'way' to polish glasses, would be hard for them to nail the convexityconcavity with those tools, especially to a specific prescription.     Probably the most unrealistic thing is how they managed to get glass that clearwithout imperfections with what they have. You  often get impurities that are legit just bits dirt in the glass, that colourmuddy the glass, or have air trapped in it.    But then again the old man Kaseki is turning out picture perfect lab equipment that would cost good money to buy today, some liberties are obv taken.",1
618,"     I was gonna say, Senku pulled up some dirt and was like ""lmao we're gonna make glass out of this, plebs"" and my only thought was ""I don't think that's exactly how it works, bro.""",1
619,"     Not random dirt, silica glass. It's still ridiculously pure like everything else in this show, after all, most of these technologies would come out so rudimentary they'd be useless, but the principle was there.",0
620,"Well, the glasses aren't necessarily  perfect.  When he puts the lens in you can see that it's got ripples to it, and likely has some small dots in there, but to someone who had terrible eyesight to start with, they'd likely be leaps and bounds better, like wearing glasses that have schmutz on them.",1
621,Hopefully they don't take too many liberties with this show... I like the realistic parts best,1
622,"     Senku put galena into that one, thus making it effectively crystal. It's not what glasses are made of now way too fragile and thick and doesn't have all the fancy anti-reflection, anti-scratching etc. features of modern lenses but I think it works. Lab glass was probably made without the lead, just regular soda-lime glass.",1
623,"No, he just made a lead mold from galena.",0
624,I think he mentioned he added the lead to make it clear.,1
625,"Not really, what matters isn't the material in particular, but how it bends light. Sure enough, in the real world a flat round piece of glass wouldn't help you improve your vision.",0
626,"Right, which is why he took the care to carve out a bowl in the glass and kept measuring her eyes to get the right angle.",1
627,"Simply put, that's not how it works.    Lenses need to take their thickness into account, otherwise the image will get distorted, and eyeballing the curvature will just get you to have a random set of foci which wouldn't help much if at all.    Now, again, it's a mangaanime so 1 billion percent accuracy isn't needed.",0
628,Suika being added to the list of things to protect.,1
629,"The sound effects of them mining, didn’t sound like rocks colliding but sticking a finger in flesh.",1
630,Sounds lewd,2
631,The old man reminds me of Joseph by some reason,2
632,My boy how to make everything has been trying to create clear glass from scratch and Senku made it in a day or two,1
633,"SENKU PLEEASE, build glasses for suika, she s gonna be so cute",1
634,My gosh Suika is so adorable ,1
635,Okay this is skyrim now with all the side quest.. love it!,1
636,"     Haha, tell my plates and phone screens that.",1
637,It's tough for what it is. Basic clay pottery would fall apart much easier. It can stand up to high pressures and more importantly to corrosive and reactive chemicals.,1
638,I'm the 1000th like nibb,1
639,Man all these episodes feel 2 mins long.,2
640,where did the two other go again? The boy and the girl in the start of the series,2
641," ""Tsukasa's kingdom to spy on him for Senku""",2
642,It's not really a spoiler if it happened in a previous episode.,2
643,It could be a spoiler to someone though ;,2
644,Backward time travelers.,2
645,It would be a spoiler if someone had for some reason entirely skipped episode 6.,2
646,Is it just me or do the instrumentals in the ED sound like a radiohead song,1
647,This anime has a way of making you appreciate the small things in life.,1
648,Someone please tell me this season is going for 2 cours. I am not ready for this show to end this in 1 or 2 episodes.,2
649,I believe it's 24 or 25 episodes this season.,2
650,Awesome. That’s 10 billion percent a surprise to me. I had no idea it would be 24 episodes.,1
651,"Suika, welcome to the specs gang.    8",1
652,Goddamn this show is so good at getting you to appreciate the things you take for granted.,1
653,Surely KinroGinro has seen the change in Suika's helmet to where there is now glass in there and she mentioned it helped her with her fuzzy vision?,1
654,Kinro is the final boss,2
655,Kingdom of Science level 1 completed.    Click next to move on to the next round.,2
656,kazuki is a cool old dude! also suika can see! the kingdom of science is looking sick,0
657,"""Labor Potential"" LOL",1
658,"Senku: man of science, child labor supporter.",1

660,This show keeps getting better every week,1
661,megane megane,2
662,"Ugh, it's so hard for me not to binge the manga...But I'll wait until the season is done.",0
663,"I like how they hate doing stuff earlier, but love to do it later with everyone.",1
664,Suika: Yay!  Kaseki: Yay!  Suika: Yay!  Kaseki: Yay  Suika: Yay!  Kaseki: Yay,1
665,Do the two guards know what those first glass experiments with Suika’s helmet were for?,2
666,Not yet.,2
667,"I didn’t watch it, but I think it’s cool",1
668,"As someone who only watches the anime, I wonder if Senku will ever think to find a to find a river and invent the hydro electric motor. Seems weird to require 2 people to run the generator for limited time when you could have basically unlimited power.",0
669,Senku's progress is based off on what is immediately needed. So think of this as not why he didnt do it. But as when he is gonna do it. Everything will be answed just be patient. As a manga reader i assure you that you will be amazed,1
670,How many episodes is this season supposed to have?,2
671,24,2
672,Thank you! That's awesome! :D,1
673,I don’t know if the songs been played before but anyone got the name of the rapjazz track that starts at  15:01?,1
674,My team is amazing,1
675,That was ten billion percent nice of Senku to make glasses for Suika. no matter how much he claims it was for pragmatic reasons.,1
676,"While we only focus on the animes setting of a small part of Japan, there's bound to be other unpetrified people in the rest of Japan and other countries",2
677,"Not gonna lie, that was some cringey ass rap which didn’t fit the scene at all",0
678,a little bit overdue I think,2
679,reminded me of rap is a man's soul from gurren lagann. ngl i kind of liked it,1
680,It makes clear that Kaseki is the boss.,1
681,"I kinda like this show, but does it get any better? Getting bored of crafting 1 item an episode...",1
682,They're speedrunning human progression. Honestly one new breakthrough per day is astounding. It took hundreds of years before glassware became common and even then only was done by artisans.,1
683,They are getting the quote on quote super dangerous science item next episode. So next episode will be less on crafting but resource gathering.,1
