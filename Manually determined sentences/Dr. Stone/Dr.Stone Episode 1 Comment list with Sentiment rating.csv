2,Can I see the manga panel?,2
3, Here  it is.,2
4," ""I'm surprised by how much they showed in the OP tbh. Anime onlys probably watching the OP thinking Chrome is Taiju lmao."" ",1
5," ""seeing Gen made me fucking explode with hype."" ",2
6," ""I went in thinking 'I wonder if the opening will give some sort of clue as to how fast the anime will go through the opening arc' then I saw gen and was like 'ooooooooooooooooooooooooh nice'"" ",1
7,"I love how  ""They had Gen colored differently, keeps that image of mysteriousness and knowing who he sides with until the end"" ",1
8," ""And his hair's the right colour too, I hated when they drew him with blonde and blue hair."" ",0
9,Who'll be voicing him?,2
10, Kengo Kawanishi ,2
11,"The only roles of his I'm familiar with is Rei in 3-gatsu. But then again he did really great as Rei, so I have high hope for this",1
12," ""I can't wait to see anime-onlies react to the crazy shit they build. honestly, I hope some episodes use that as a cliffhanger so there are theories on how the fuck they're gonna build a car or whatever""      ""so in 2-cours, you think we'll get up to the final battle with Tsukasa? I think that was around chapter 75 or so. if not, where would be a good stopping point?"" ",1
13,"Incoming ""Scientist Engineer react to Dr. Stone""    I think so too, right around before  ""sea exploration arc. Maybe after putting Tsukasa in the refrigerator""     As for first cour stop point,  ""after Senku become the village chief, probably during after or before Ruri told Seku about the village stories"" ",2
14," ""Tsukasa getting frozen after the final battle and Senku setting off to save him is a great spot to end this season, I think."" ",1
15,Me too. I can't think of any other good stop point for a 2-cour in dr. stone. Anywhere before that would feel like an annoying cliffhanger,1
16,"I kinda did ""Audio Engineer reacts to Dr. Stone"" a couple times in the manga discussions      s ""when they were making radios and microphones and stuff""  so yeah that's gonna happen, but with different experts every week",2
17,"If ever the manga gets to reinventing Javascript, it'll be my time to shine!",1
18,"I sure hope you're right with those stop points. The pacing seems good enough.    RemindMe! 6 months    If you get it close, i'll gild.",1
19,Got 10 billion percent excited to see my boy  GEN!!!  in the opening.,1
20," ""I'm a bit surprised at how much more the anime's hyping up Taiju & Yuzuriha, gonna be a bit more a shock to anime onlys when the village twist happens "" ",1
21," ""we basically got the same hype in the first 12 chapters"" ",2
22,"Well, I guess it's time to get excited, I presume?",1
23,It's finally here! Cant believe my most fave shonen in jump rn is getting animated wohoo!,1
24,Really interesting premise.    Will be highly anticipating this every week.,1
25,     I can't stress out enough on how this is relatable.,1
26,"There is a rather charming Hungarian story by Elek Benedek about a princess who told the king she loves him like salt, got banished for her insolence, only to a prince to remove salt from the king's every single meal, making him unable to eat anything because everything tasted like shit without salt. The king realized how much his daughter loves him, and they lived happily ever after.",1
27,"Good onii-chan caring for his imouto.    Or maybe the other way around, I dunno.",1
28,"hi, im a proud hungarian and there is a missunderstanding here. the prince was not the brother of the princess he was the prince of a nother country. they met after the bannishment and have fallen in love. after that the prince invited the king from the princess's country and told his own chef not to use salt.",2
29,"I liked it my way better.  I'll write my own version, like Disney! ",1
30,"i must agree with you, the siscon prince sounds much more entertaining xd",1
31,    blankblink ,2
32,"bruh, the childhood feels",0
33,"Yup, they're ruined forever for both of us! XD",1
34,Reality can be whatever I want.,2
35,"A little late to the party, but I faintly remember this story back from my childhood but in my version it was a fairy godmother-like being that made all the salt in the kingdom disappear overnight with magic to teach the King a lesson. Didn't know it originates from Hungary tho, TIL.",2
36,You mean otouto caring for his onee-san?    Ara ara...,2
37,I mean their ages aren't specified so it could be either one.,2
38,Twincest,2
39,I guess the king just feel salty.,2
40,He played too much gacha,1
41,I read that story when I was a kid. TIL it's Hungarian.,2
42,"that's also a romanian story i don't know where it originated. it's called ""ca sarea in bucate"" over here",2
43,Wikipedia says the fairytale is  Slovak ,2
44,"Holy crap, that's a blast from the past, I remember reading that story in grade school!      Found the classic 1980 cartoon version too! ",1
45,She said she loved him like meat loves salt and got banished.  mean while her sisters said some bull shit about loving him more than gems or gold.  Always heard it was at her wedding that he finally tried meat with out salt and realized how he messed up.,2
46,"Salt was a  1 commodity for much of early civilization. Assuming this originates from a time before refrigeration, any ruler must understand the value of salt ..",1
47,wow banishing for that pretty intense.  Nice job prince.,1
48,I thought that one was German.,2
49,   ;    The best find of the night thanks to you hahah,1
50,That sounds like one of the stranger adaptations of Shakespeare’s King Lear,2
51,"Wich of course extents to ingredients and seasonings that include salt in them, that statement is very much true.",1
52,MSG works too.,1
53,Makes Stuff Good,1
54,Reminds me of best girl contest,1
55,Salt or ketchup.,2
56,Ketchup is a source of salt. Like anchovies.,2
57,"Ketchup is the way to go, fuck mayo degenerates, that shit looks like fucking pus.",0
58, Brown Sauce  will always remain the king of condiments.,1
59,"Seeing that reminded me of Hbomb's ""Soy Boy Diet"" videos where he brought up meat really doesn't taste that great until you add some kind of seasoning or oil.",2
60,Like best girl contests,1
61,Grampa says when hungry even rocks with a pinch of salt taste good.,1
62,yeah just a little bit of salt on a meal works wonders,1
63,Inb4 needs rice onsen episode.,2

74,"No joke, skullcandy uproarwere my favourite headphones back when I didn't have money",1
75,... I've been reading this for over a year and it never once occurred to me that those could be headphones.        disbelief ,1
76,"Yeah same, I just assumed it was hair accessory..  like it was a manga  so its possible.     Watching anime I was like  they look a lot like headphones             ",1
77,"They are not, otherwise Senkuu would have already used the materials from it.",2
78, ,2
79,but they don't reach her ears.,2
80,            move around                 extend out                 i dunno,1
81,Either way it's damn durable.,2
82,All clothes disappeared.. but they stay      is it a part of her body  ,1
83,same here i totally never realized they were headphones either,1
84,"               I just said it  looks like  but ehh I don't know what exactly it is, could probably just be accessory  a really durable one ",0
85,"They are indeed headphones, and honestly if I woke up and was told they were permanently fused to my skull, I would be freaking the fuck out",2
86,Are they? I don't recall the manga ever really referring to them. They've always just been a hair accessory,2

88,Nokia headphones.,1
89,When Senku mentioned the exact date I half expected him to pull out a Nokia phone with like 30% battery left,1
90,nah dude the entire stonning happened cuz 2 nokia phones clashed and world went kaboom.,2
91,They're probably made of plastic.  So it makes sense they wouldn't degrade.,2
92,Even plastic decomposes on that timescale,2
93,"They were full of fine cracks and stuff so they were decomposing. Don't know it that type of plastic that would last that long some claims are some plastic it thousands of years. Direct sun no way it lasts, but that shaded light I don't know.",2
94,she was secretly an astronaut trainee so she had the same material in her headphones that was used in space-craft?,2
95,Could be metal.,2
96,"Metal erodes. unless it's something hardy like Bronze no way it survived,",2
97,Could be stone.,2
98,Depends on its exposure,2
99,Made of Nintendium.,2
100,UV does an absolute number on most plastics in mere years.,1
101,All they need is now to look for some Nokia phones and they have got music to enjoy.,1
102,Between Yuzu and Miku..does NO anime girl in 2019 know how to wear her headphones properly??,2
103,I think they literally fossilized on top of her head,1
104,yeah some top quality headphones right there.,2
105,Exactly!,1
106,Plastic  is  that durable though.,2
107,"It looked like they had become stone like her clothes, just a different color.    Seems like anything in contact with their body at the time of the light became covered in stone.",1
108,"Ya, whatever it cost for her headphone, it is still worth it.     Damn, imaging that this headphone get passed down generations after generations and it still work just as well.",1
109,Imagine having to stay conscious for 3700 years with nothing but your own mind to entertain you.,0
110,To be honest I'm surprised anyone is still fucking sane after that. Think about that shit. All you can do is think. You have no way to physically express your emotions at all.    You wanna cry you have to  think  about crying. You wanna scream you have to  think  about it. All that and you can't even kill yourself. It's even worse if you don't want to. You have to simply think about sleeping. Jesus fucking Christ.,1
111,seems like green-hair is the only one who did that. And he's clearly not sane. Everyone else got lost in the unconscious.,1
112,Taiju also maintained his thoughts. This guy's sheer will is amazing.,0
113,I was under the impression that that he zoned out for a while. but fair enough. He's too muscle-headed to go crazy though. I'm not sure he could snap from anything short of his girlfriend getting smashed.,2
114,         ,2
115,          ,2
116,     We NTR now?,2
117,YAMERO,2
118,CEASE,2
119,Yamete Kudasai!,1
120,Yamete kudastop senpai,1
121,"they both had that same issue for him it was losing track of the numbers with the pull to become unconscious being very strong, shows in that only 6 months difference from when they woke up",1
122,"I think people generally take this whole ""awake while being turned to stone"" thing a bit too seriously, and that time probably passed pretty fast for anyone but Senku, or maybe even for him as well somehow.    Suffice to say, I don't think it was something Inagaki thought about too much.",1
123,The impression I got from the manga is that Taiju was barely maintaining his consciousness through all that time while Senku was pretty much aware of things.,1
124,"Taiju tried to stay conscious, but he did fall unconscious like the rest eventually.  The manga makes it clearer  that Taiju did black out after a while",1
125,It was pure R E S O L V E,1
126, 3:45  When you randomly get encased in rock for nearly 4000 years but don't eventually stop thinking because you have the greater resolve,1
127,    DETERMINATION,0
128,He did it for the nookie,1
129,"Senku's clearly nuts but a good kind. Determined will power to keep going so he can figure out WHY this happened to him.     I think the fact their all conscious is worse though. Like that girl who was just out walking her dog and thinking: ""Mom... Dad...HELP ME!""    It's even worse if you think about the possibility that there's people who were in the worst positions possible. Anyone getting surgery - dead soon as they crack open. Babies, with no mother's to care for them..    Doubt the show's gonna go that dark but it gets ya thinking.",2
130,I was mostly worried about the people in the planes and cars who were insta-smashed.    THough I can't help but wonder if even being smashed to pieces might not necessarily mean death if the right actions are taken.,0
131,"With Senku, I wouldn't be shocked if he'll find a way to glue people back together to see if it works.",2
132,"I wonder if people who happened to be underground at the time, or paranoid people who thought something was wrong when they saw petrified birds and were hiding in their bunkers or something, were unaffected by the petrification, though.",2
133,Man that had to have been a sucky existence. Possibly how a pocket of people could've existed for a time.,0
134,"Did he really though? He stayed awake for 3700 years, unless he dreamed part of that, but would he know if there was another 50,000 years which to him seemed like 1 second, in between those 3700 years?     There are structures which are older than 3700 years  yet there isn't even a hint of buildings around the place they woke up at? There should be remnants showing all over that forest.    So it is logical to conclude that he did pass out for much of that time. I would even think that he dreamed counting at least a few thousand of those years.",2
135,"im pretty sure the darkness would have taken over if they stopped thinking cuz we can see people whose stone body eroded and stuff is growing inside them, presumably weaker-willed people who gave in to the darkness and allowed their consciousness to die",2
136,"I don't think its as heavy handed as that. Yeah, I'm sure it plays a part in how the person will act when they escape but having a strong will won't cause you to escape.     The acid did.    So, by that logic not having a strong will wont end you either right? People broke probably because of shit happening to their bodies. So at that point it doesn't matter how strong willed you are. If your body was on an airplane mid flight you are fucked.",2
137,"The people who broke didn't look like they broke as humans with rock shells, the broken edges were also fully stone. So some people seem to have fully solidified. Unless the two survivors  un -solidified somehow, there must be something that differentiates dormant people from dead statues.",2
138,     This is my theory actually. They did mention how it was strange that they both woke up during the same year. I think as time goes on the effect wears off provided that you stay alive by not losing consciousness.,1
139,"It probably is the other way around, the more you lose conscious the more stone you become. Since these madlads were conscious the entire time they only had a thin layer of stone. Which the weak acid was able to erode.",2
140,"I'm not sure it makes sense that consciousness has anything to do with it. If so, then there's no way a sole feather would be de-petrifiable, and even the bird wouldn't stand much of a chance.    I think it's more likely that the nitral or whatever substance somehow reverses the petrification via some technobabble explanation, and everyone is normally just fully petrified.",0
141,"     The petrification process could be weak to electricity or some chemical that the brain produces, I guess. The brain is more active when fully conscious and actively thinking than it is when unconscious or catatonic, right? Could make sense.",0
142,"My point was more that things with no  the feather  or low  the small bird  consciousness were able to be cured just fine. There's other issues too, for example your theory posits that it's weakened by some byproduct of an organic brain, but then you have to explain why that brain didn't die and rot at least 3600 years ago. To me it seems more reasonable that the brain and everything else was transformed into a stone-like substance. Then you have to explain why they were able to still be conscious with a transformed brain, but that's a bit easier considering that the idea of the mind being somehow separate from the body is already pretty widely debated by all manner of philosophers. Anyway, the full transformation that then gets undone by the magical acid just seems more logically consistent with what we've seen and can hypothesize about.    Of course, this  is  just fiction, and pretty far out stuff at that, so the writer could take it in whatever direction they please and pull any explanation they want out of their ass, so I'm not planning on dying on this hill.",2
143,"If that were the case, why weren't the birds completely solidified? It's not like they had any force of will to keep them going.",2
144,"The birds were a prototype run, so there's some justification for the birds working differently.    Alternatively, in the Dr. Stone universe, all birds are filled with undying fury at all times.",1
145,"     If it were Canadian Geese, then this would be canon",2
146,"I really think everyone is fully solidified; if they weren't, their organs would start to decay over time.     Maybe if the outer shell starts to break, the petrification on the inside reverses itself almost immediately?",1
147,"Ah, you may be right. They'd suffocate in minutes from oxygen deprivation. So they must be fully stone, and something causes that to reverse before the shell cracks.",2
148,     See: Canada Goose,0
149,Seems like simply breaking isn't enough. it'll be most likely explained later though,2
150,"     Well, they un-petrified a bird. Are we to believe that a bird had the will to stay alive for 3700 years?",2
151,"the problem is the difference between the people that got out, they got ""out"" of the stone shell. we see several people who are in pieces where they are stone throughout. the acid would corrode the whole thing not magically restore the inner flesh",1
152,So the bird has a strong will ?,1
153,The less smart an animal is the less it thinks about stuff other than surviving so it’s concaciousness probably doesn’t even exist,0
154,Nice birb!,0
155,Well now the girls REALLY gotta save Saga now...,1
156,Fuck,2
157,Shit... RIP all millennials,2
158,This took me out of the moment for sure but I've decided to sit tight and let the show do it's thing. Just doesn't feel right to me that you could be conscious yet swimming in total darkness unable to move for 3700 years and pop out with your sanity and personality in tact like those two did,1
159,Taiju blacked out towards the end there.  He wasn't able to fully keep track of what was going on around him.,1
160,"Hm... To compare, there are cases where people who were comatose for a long time, stayed sane by thinking. Just thinking through out the entirety of their unconsciousness. Penning novels, imagining new worlds, or in the case of one dude... Spite because he fucking  loathed  Barney with a burning passion of a thousand suns.",1
161,Lucky that these two are already insane.,1
162,Definitely let the show do its thing. Otherwise you'll be sitting there questioning the plausibility of everything they do. It's an anime after all.,2
163,"If you care about logic, you're in for a ride. As a manga reader, they'll spin everything as science but almost all of it will be ""hot word bingo"", saying sciency things to excuse whatever bs they just made up. Was a turn off for me reading the manga, but I'm enjoying the quality of the anime and how fun it is.",1
164,Ah gotchya. Was Kinda hyped cuz I do chemistry stuff at college but that sounds a bit disappointing,2
165,"My personal theory is that when someone is frozen in stone their psychological state is frozen as well, so they continue doing thinking about whatever they were thinking about when they froze.",2
166,"Yeah, that isn't believable in the slightest bit, but not any less than magic or super power.",1
167,I could see that being an issue whenever they start releasing other people,1
168,You wanna poop but you can only  think  about pooping.,2
169,Lmao,2
170,Sane is probably a strong word...,1
171,They would eventually stop thinking,2
172,"Eventually, humanity stopped thinking.",2
173,it's like the fucking guys from jojo that went to space. his mind was just gone,0
174,most were unable to stay conscious the push was to strong i mean even they struggled really hard.,1
175,"Wouldn't it be like those sensory deprivation tanks?    I hear they are pleasant experiences for most.    Most people would likely remain sane, although I think it's likely that they aren't properly conscious, seeing as they were locked into obsessively thinking the same thing over and over, like their very stream of thought was turned to stone.",0
176,"Solitary confinement can do some serious harm to your mental and physical health.  If you are stuck in a stone for 3700 years, you will definitely go nuts.",1
177,That was why so many of the FAITH AIs in the Bobiverse series didn't work out right.,1
178,Thanks for adding to my nightmares ,2
179,"I think we’re going to have to get used to the pop-science of this show being cut with a healthy amount of shonen hotbloodedness.     Which means I don’t expect anyone to die of a simple infection, I’m sure Senku will perfectly remember every scrap of important research and science needed to rebuild civilization despite that being basically the totality of human knowledge when people generally have to specialize on one field and no one will be too broken up on how insane they must be after 3700 years of being conscious  or at least conscious for parts of it  and trapped in stone.",2
180,Senku is a walking Wikipedia.,0
181,I don’t think it is even possible for any human to do that now that I think about it,0
182,I guess you would stop thinking.,2
183,Very true. It's like the lock something syndrome. So scary af,2
184,"If you're adept in meditation you could just put yourself in a trance for years at a time, but yeah any normal person would have gone mad.",2

204,Togashi still wouldn't finish HxH in his mind,2
205,"actually it would happen faster than you may think, just 2-3 days and you will start hallucinating like crazy, after few weeks you would prob die since you would go crazy, there is no way they would surive even single year at that state and in anime we are talking about 2700 years",1

370,"Between this show and Fire Force, which one is more likely to be bigger? They're both top 10 manga in jump, right?",2
371,"Depends a lot on general audience tastes. Fire Force is more of a FMA-meets-Soul-Eater vibe, and this is something pretty different. They might both be shounen, but they're in kinda different niches.",1
372,"True, but I prefer Dr Stone more because it's just so unique",2
373,This is a shounen?,1
374,"IIRC, the manga runs in Shounen Jump.    Shounen's just a demographic identifier, not a genre. You've got action-adventure shounens, battle shounens, sports shounens, harem shounens, mystery shounens, comedy shounens, romance shounens, etc. - and any combination of the above.    Dr. Stone isn't a battle action shounen like Naruto Bleach BNHA etc., but it's still catering to that demographic",1
375,"Ah, makes sense. Whenever I hear shounen I just get the mental picture of your typical battle powerup show",1
376,"That's the main shounen genre we get exposed to in anime, but ya gotta remember that stuff like Nisekoi  harem romcom  is technically shounen too, as was Death Note  supernatural crime thriller , simply due to the audience they're targeting. That's why you see a number of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things manga tagged seinen, because that's just an audience descriptor, and apparently the older male audience likes that stuff.",2
377,"But Shounen is listed as “genre” on MAL and IMBD though    Oh, right. I kinda had he idea in my head that shounen = Naruto, Bleach and etc",1
378,"     You'll notice that both of those platforms slap more than one tag on the stuff they're listing.    What I'd expect from something with ""shounen, romance"" listed as its tags is wildly different than what I'd expect from something with ""shoujo, romance"" listed instead, so while it's not really a genre  and certain people get way too pedantic about that , it's still useful as a tag in a similar way to how a genre tag is useful.         That's not uncommon. action adventure battle shounens are the most common type of shounen for people to have seen, so ""shounen"" often gets used as shorthand to describe the most common subgenre. It's incorrect terminology, but it works 90% of the time.",1
379,"A lil bit correction, Fire Force isn't a Shonen Jump series, only Dr.Stone is. Fire Force is a series published in Kodansha's Weekly Shonen Magazine, while Weekly Shonen Jump where Dr. Stone is, is published by Shueisha. They're from different publishing company.",1
380,Deffo gonna be fire force it's lit ,1
381,Agreed. Dr.stone is okay.,1
382,I really enjoyed what I've read of the manga but it's very slow paced  I think,1
383,"Fire Force isn't from jump, it's from the same magazine where Fairy tail was published. Depends a lot on how consistent anime quality will be. Personally, I prefer Fire Force source  I'm not up-to-date with both Stone and Fire  so I expect Dr.Stone to be more popular on r anime. But they differ a lot in everything, so it's not the most interesting match. More interesting is how other ""survival"" animes this season will be received in comparison to this.",1
384,"     this one will pass without infame or glory, i read the manga and its just boring    im being honest, the guy that writted this manga is the same from Soul eater and this guys is fucking amazing making concepts and shit that looks cool    but when it come down to storys....    so predictable, so simple, so childish, bla bla bla, so boring    and i know you guys dont want to hear it, im probably going to get downvoted, but its the truth     ;    in the other hand Dr. Stone is pretty weak at the start, the story doesnt get good untill we get to around ep 5 or 6 when more characters are introduced and they let us scape from the boring original cast, so the first episode was nice, im sure the show will be able to keep a stedy audience untill we get to the good parts",1
385,not sure about FF but feel Dr. Stone got off to a strong start and do think it's built up enough hype and attention to hold the audience.,1
386,"Yup Fire Force story draws similar from BNHA which I hate for being generic trash with godly animation for the plot of this calibre.    Watched the first episode today, planning to sticking around just for the animation and music. Its all Hero save this that bs",1
387,It's really sad that a show like Firce Force got that godly animation...,1
388,I have a feeling Fire Force will be bigger with the younger crowd. Not MHA levels or anything but enough that I could see it gain more notoriety in the west. Dr. Stone will be more of a hit with older fans I'd say  although I like both so far . They both have serious potential if both anime keep up the quality.,1
389,Haven't heard of either of these things before look forward to checking them out :D,1
390,"I'm feeling like this might be the bigger one. Maybe it's just the Jojo-esque art style and the general hope-punk vibe I""m getting but this, is a world builder's dream right here.",1
391,"     Depends on what you mean by top 10. If by sales, Dr. Stone isn't in the top 10 best-selling at all.",1

412,"I'm coming into this bare balls. Idk what to expect. Is it going to be an anime about Senku teaching us science-y shit, kinda like cells at work?

442,Dude Senko plays civ 5 on super cheat mode. He gets techs way out of order.,1
443,"     It's Boichi's weak point, almost all his girls look the same and that look is ""pornstar"".     Well, it's a weak point only under a certain point of view.",1
444,"They legit look like porcelain dolls with dead eyes, man. It creeps me out, are they at least going to have expressive faces like the guys?",2
445,"Some of them more than others. Like the blonde girl you see in the OP, maybe because she’s supposed to look less conventionally attractive, she actually is probably the most expressive female character in the manga.",1
446,"The manga's artist Boichi, use to be a, well… hentai artist.",2
447,"Just curious but is this meant to be kind of an episodic thing, where they reinvent something each episode? Or is there a more plot-focused background for this show?",1
448,"Oh, there's definitely a plot, but they do re-invent stuff almost every episode to solve specific problems. They even have short arcs for more complicated stuff.",1
449," ""Prehistoric problems require modern solutions"" ",1
450,"Plot focused because they usually build up smaller inventions to get to one big complex invention with actual use, for example - acquiring and developing several small inventions like light bulbs, wiring and batteries to invent spotlights. Which can be used for lighting up large areas so that things like Mining or night exploration are vastly easier.",1
451,"Plot focused, the main conflict will be introduced next episode or the one after, probably.     Going from there, it'll go like this, Senku will set a big goal, to achieve the goal he'll need to reinvent its base components first and we'll be along for the wild ride.     After the goal is achieved, it'll more or less repeat until the yet undisclosed conflict comes to the forefront.     So it will probably straddle the line a bit between episodic ""lets work towards this invention"" and ""okay now that that's done let's look at the bigger picture and move the plot forward"".",1
452,"Honestly, I'd call it a good mixture of both! At least, for the duration this season is likely to cover.",2
453,"There is a plot but each manga chapter typically focuses on one concept to explore.    I will say that the first main arc of Dr Stone is pretty weak, the second arc massively switches things up and that's pretty much when the manga really hits its stride.",2
454,it's not invention if he doesn't come up with it on his own,1
455,"For you,  u Schlongr  u amgamo1 and  u Karabanera , something to keep in mind is that socieites do not actually progress along a single line of  ""era""s, with one technology cleanly enabling the rest, like in a civ game or what ""Stone Age"", ""Bronze age"", and ""Iron Age"" implies. Those eras are just convieient milestones to split up European and Middle Eastern history into; and for Civ, it's juet easier to develop game mechanics that way, combined with most people being faimuilar with the progression Eurasian socities happened to go in    As an example: Mesoamerican socities only invented Bronze working around 1200 AD, only a few hundred years before the Spanish arrived. Yet, even back at 300 BC, when they still only had wood and stone tools, where, for instance, the Maya city El Mirador had 100,000+ people, had a dozens of giant pyramids, including  the tallest pyramid ever built  arguably  , etc.    Even when the Mesoamericans DID invent Bronze Metallurgy, they never really used it for tools or weapons on a widespread basis: They had an abundance of obsidian, which can be  relatively easily be made far sharper then even modern steel scalpels get , and without metal armor to shatter against, the durability isn't as much an issue.     It's a mistake to look at a single element of society, like what materials were used for tools, and use that to judge the overall complexity of a given society, in accordance with when Europeans happened to develop that same technology. Different cultures in different places will develop differently.",1
456,"i thought the common line of era is Ancient, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Industrial, modern atomic information eras, which encompasses more elements of a society than the Stone Bronze Iron one.",1
457,"Well i knew that already, so i have no idea, what is the point of explanation. I made a comparison to Civ, because it's easier to understand and write",1
458,"The guy is an awesome artist, but he draws girls horrible. Their lips and nose just get ridiculous to the point of a fetish. This gets much clearer later in the manga with more female cast.",1
459,Both. It's gonna be an amazing ride.,2
460,Kinda a mix of both honestly,2
461,"it's seems like an episode of rust, from naked to ak",1
462,"More the first, a little of the second",1
463,"and also the mystery factor, figuring how the disaster happened, who caused, and why ?",2
464,"The first one. As time goes on he discovers all the little things we take advantage of and give not a care about every day.    Edit: Or well, a combination of both. You'll see : ",2

474,"You'd need to do a lot of personality alteration to get doujins going - Senku's pretty hardcore in his one track mind personality. No time for women, it's science time.",2
475,But he has Stamina Man as his partner,1
476,"Stamina man respects women. Besides, he only has eyes for one.",1
477,     who said sex isn't part of science?????,1
478,Senku did.,1
479,This was exactly what I thought when I first read the synopsis of the show.,1

484,Poor guy had a stroke.,1
485,He got petrified,1
486,"We're 1 hour in from your post, what's the over under on how long from your post before there is one?",0
487,That reminds me of the movie  Passengers ' plot. It's kind of disturbing if you think about it. They can revive someone of their choosing and lie about who why how that person is revived.    Thankfully with these specific people their personalities aren't the type who'd do that,1

503,"Fun facts - Stone's artist, Boichi  real name Park Moojik , is a native South Korean.  However, he left for Japan in 2003 due to his dissatisfaction at the Korean government's clamping down on freedom of expression in print manhwa via the 1997 Juvenile Protection Act.              After much consideration  and some protests , he left to start his career in Japan, seeing no future in Korea. He enjoys the freedoms of Japan's manga industry; freedoms of speech and expression that he never had before.    PS. The Korean government also tried applying the same censorship laws to digital webtoons, but had to back down due to intense opposition from its readers. The result is webtoons are afforded more freedoms of expression than print counterparts  ex. big presence of pornographic webtoons .  The takeaway is that a good amount of Japanese manga content that foreign observers find shocking and distasteful  incest, lolishota, shock value, socially disturbing themes etc.  came about because of industry freedoms, and the general mood among creators seems to be that they have a right to portray said content no matter how deviant it seems to outsiders.    Of course, the Japanese government gets embarassed instead; hence the attempts to regulate manga content; which the manga artists always rally against.",0
504,"Another fun Boichi fact:    The man doesn't speak japanese, so conversations between him  the artist  and the writer of Dr. Stone  who is japanese  are a bit weird since it requires the help of translation!",1
505,"I recall hearing somewhere that when asked on improving his Japanese language skills, Boichi supposedly said he'd rather spend time improving his art than improve his fluency.    Something about art is his lifeblood, therefore it requires more investment than learning a new language.",1
506,"That's just lame excuse which looks good enough to supporters, imo",0
507,"Or the more realistic one, he simply doesn't have enough time to learn how to speak and write Japanese and would rather spend any free time he has as a mangaka resting, seeing how much time other mangaka's spend drawing I feel like this is a big possibility",1
508,"Bruh he lives in japan, at some point he'll have to learn",2
509,Apparently not.,0
510,You clearly overrestimate the Free time a published mangaká has. Go watch Bakuman.,0
511,"well that could be said about any job, ""i have to focus on something so i don't have time for this""        He isn't the first emigrant ever, drawing isn't the most complicated thing in the world.    I'm not saying that learning language is easy, i'm not saying that drawing is easy, all i am saying is that there are tons of emigrants everywhere and i don't think that this excuse works.    People live that way and menage to do their jobs and learn language, more or less.     I'm not saying i would be able to do this, but i think its mandatory to learn a language of a country you moved to and there are no excuses for not doing so.",0
512,"Like the other guy has said, being a mangaka takes a hell lot of time. Yes, drawing isn't the most complicated thing in the world, but he has to spend so much time drawing that it basically eats his life up.     I suggest you read into the lifestyles of manga artists to see how bad it is fo them.",1
513,"yeah it's not uncommon for them to have little to no sleep, rarely if ever leave the house, their art takes up all their time and they often end up with illness.",1
514,"     Wtf did I just read, I'm fucking crying",1
515,"I don't think you understand how many hours are put into making a successful manga. Eiichiro Oda the creator of One Piece has said before that he works from 5 am to 2 am getting about 3 hours of sleep everyday, and only taking breaks to do things like eating and spending time with his family I presume. Although, I believe he has a better schedule these days as he usually takes one week off about every two-three chapters nowadays. But still, these guys have an absolutely hellish schedule, and I have the upmost respect for them.",1
516,Yeah and Oda is crazy genius level when doing mangaka so many have it worse then that.  Bakuman shows a good example of what they go through.,0
517,"I loved that anime, it’s really great to see some of the process behind writing a manga, and getting it adapted into an anime.",0
518,yeah i think that series was handled so well.,1
519,"Learning a language isn't easy, especially at his age. It would be a serious time investment, so it's not like he wouldn't be trading it off for something else.",0
520,"Learning a language isn't easy, learning Japanese is hard as shit.     I have a demanding job and a fuck-ton of random hobbies but still can make an hour a day to study Japanese. And unlike him, it's not like I have access to native speakers or anything.     I can't imagine living in a country that enables me to do what I love and not learning the language. It just sounds like the ultimate excuse.",1
521,Plus korean is similar to Japanese,2
522,Not really.,0
523,I guess it depends on how you see it. English is similar to all the European languages.  That's why it's so much easier to learn them then the ones from Africa or Asia.,0
524,In terms of grammar they're actually pretty similar.,1
525,"Correct, but it's insane to think that improving his fluency isn't a very relevant barrier for improving his art too, since only when he thoroughly understands what the writer wants to convey can he really draw it. To think you can get away with sacrificing your communication skills and that that time wouldn't be useful for your art too is shortsighted.",1
526,Or if you wanna get negative about it: he's an immigrant who refuses to learn his new nationality's mother language.,1
527,"As always, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.",2
528,"The dude probably has enough Japanese knowledge that he can survive, which I personally think is the bare minimum that you should have if you plan on living in a foreign country for any extended period of time. You should at least know enough that you can get around on your own without worry.",1
529,"Indeed, who are we to say what the man's priorities should be?",0
530,"Gods! No, more than that! Redditors!  s",0
531,"Well said, in the end of the day they're making it work.",0
532,Oh yikes. This reminds me of those “speak English” crazies here in the states.,2
533,It's a disservice to yourself if you refuse to engage in a culture you've transplanted yourself into even on rudimentary terms by not picking up a basic knowledge of the language. That's exactly how cultural cloisters and cultural tension occurs.,0
534,"You should speak english if you immigrate to America. You dont go to a friends house to bring your mannerisms there, thats just rude.",0
535,We only speak the American here,1
536,"     No you shouldn't, plenty of communities are able to function with very rudimentary english skills.           The country isn't your house. You don't get to enforce your culture onto others.",1
537,"     Once again, a country isn't your house. You don't own it and you don't get to dictate how others live in it.         By only knowing Korean, he isn't ""enforcing"" anything. Nobody's culture is being erased. The only ones doing any enforcing and erasing are those that expect immigrants to abandon their cultural heritage.",0
538,"     The purpose of a country is to pool together the resources of its inhabitants for the purpose of improving the well being of its constituents. The purpose of a house is to shelter its individual owner. A country doesn't have an owner.         Forcing someone to learn another language even if they don't want to would be trying to minimize their Korean heritage and background, yes. I don't know what you're going on about with this ""TRUE Korean"" nonsense. It's the same sort of idea behind what China is doing with the Uighur in camps, forcing a new language and culture upon them.",0
539,"     umm indeed. This guy being forced to learn Japanese isn't going to improve his life  or else he would have already decided to learn it already  and him only knowing Korean isn't harming anyone. The guy is working and doing just fine as a productive member of society without learning Japanese.          The guy is already there and immigrated. Japan is their home now. And no, many don't immigrate voluntarily and are instead forced to. Irregardless Japan is so desperately in need of young workers in order to replace its aging population that it should be lowering barriers to immigration, not lowering them.",1
540,"       No you don't lol. Tons of countries allow far far far more immigration than Japan does and there's none of this fictitious ""cultural destruction"".           What? Nobody does that.             Immigrants are more likely to have children than non-immigrants. And as long as you're a major industrialized world power like Japan, they're never going to have difficulty finding people who want to immigrate there. You need enough people to at least replace the aging workforce so as to fund the social services and healthcare of the elderly. If not, then these social services and those that rely on them are in serious jeopardy.         There's literally not enough people. Companies could make the jobs as attractive as humanely possible with the best conditions but there's not enough people to replace the numbers that are retiring.",1
541,Sadly. that's how I see it.,1
542,Boichi intended to be an artist from childhood. He majored in physics in college as preparation to draw science fiction works and went on to graduate school to major in image technology.  He can draw pages like this. ,1
543,"After so many years working in Japan, the dude still didn't bothered to learn Japanese till this day???",1
544,he also majored in physics just for the sake of making science fiction stories. that's how you know the man is serious!,1
545,I don't super follow artists or mangakas but Boichi is the one that stood out to me because of his intense art style is striking.     Just look at this panel  from the manga Sun-Ken Rock     And this ,1
546,"Oh, wait, shit - Boichi did Sun-Ken Rock?    Because damn does that manga have some good art. I wonder if the setting and its somewhat subversive messages had anything to do with the reasons he left South Korea that  u zz2000 mentioned.    Oh damn, he did Hotel too. That one's a trippy read.     But it's got some amazing art. ",1
547,"One thing that I feel common in Boichi's art is the lead character's eyebrows and the surrounding region  might as well say the eyes, brows and forehead region . Just go through Sun-Ken Rock, Wallman, Raqiya  second mc , Origin and Space Chef Kaisar.",1
548,What's the source on that last image? Looks cool!,0
549,"It's from Boichi's ""Hotel"", which is a collection of  I want to say five?  unrelated oneshot chapters, mostly dealing with extinction in one way or another.    Some of them have a few really great panels, but the ones that don't often have extremely interesting premises or interesting late-act twists.",1
550,How can you not recognize this dude's art? It's distinguishable as fuck!,1
551,"It's probably because the tones and genres of the stories he uses it to tell are so wildly different, which throws me off a bit.",1
552,He sure likes his spiky white hair.,1
553,Also there are a couple  very good  chapters in Sun-Ken Rock...,1
554,"Thank you for sharing this information. That's really interesting to know.         Knowing that manga is a multimillion dollar industry I will find it really hard for them to ever be able to regulate, as the publishers will not want or allow their businesses to be affected by such thing as it may highly limit their content, and therefore their profits.",2
555,yeah and recently in regards to anime manga had crazy stuff like the UN trying to step in and cut some off from us.,0
556,The amount of lewd manhuas is amazing in its own way. Along with that and the huge amount of erotic Korean films I feel this is the people's way of skirting around South Korea's ban on porn.,1
557,漫画xJapan = manga    漫画xChina = manhua    漫画xKorea = manhwa,1
558,Forget manhwa have funwaa,1
559,The artwork is some ero-manhwa just blows me away.,1
560,     Color me curious. Can you give me an example.,2
561,Look up hahri's lumpy boardhouse. The most amazing thing is that they are almost always  full color ,1
562,Thanks wonderful,1
563, r manhwa had a thread  on the topic  the other day.,2
564,The way they mainly skirt around the porn ban is kpop tho.,1
565,"These were actually fun, thanks for taking the time to type that out!",1
566,So that's why the manga  haven't read it  reminds me of manhwa art.,1
567,The start of the manga is especially manhwa-esque and like Boichi's other works  like Sun-Ken Rock . The artstyle right now has a lot more manga influence to it.,1
568,There's nothing for Japan to get embarrass about.  Nothing good had ever came from censoring art.,1
569,"Boichi is a Manga drawing machine. He was drawing his original sci-fi distopia manga Origin completed  on  Weekly  Young Magazine, also as an illustration work for Dr.Stone on  Weekly  Shonen Jump. Yes, he was actually drew Shonen and seinen series simultaneously, even switching art style with only few hiatus.    I'm a Japanese, I know there are few mangaka who can drew multiple series simultaneously, but Boichi is a special being. No one could keep quality drawing like  this  at same time. Much respect.",1
570,wow thx for the info wasn't aware of that.  Must be touch for them.,1
571,Miyazaki that deviant.,2
572,I knew it! This definitely looked like the work of the artist behind Sun-Ken-Rock!,1
573,     You mean the    good shit   ,2
574,Guess they have more in common with their psycho neighbors up North than they think.,2
575,"Interesting, so it explain why Korean manhwa totally shift to it current stage like to days.    I miss the time like early 2000s, there is a lot good mahwa like Blade of the Phantom Master, Cheollang Yeoljeon, Far west gunslinger  not sure the name is right ,... They are all good and have quite unique art style and plot, which many of them are my all time favorite.     Sadly i rarely see any good manwa there days that even no publisher in my country border with manwha anymore. While Korean webtoon sure has some interesting series, but their turn into boring later since they try prolong it unnecessarily, and i'm tired with all thore nonsense pornographic webtoons. What a shame.",2
576,"basically: ""you guys are a bunch of dog eating corrupt normies c ya I will be chilling in japan""",2
577,Time for         SUTON WARUDO       Can't wait for Bucciarati to wake up.,1

582,"The way I used to describe this to friends when it was only a manga was:    ""You know that Primitive technology YT channel? Well imagine that but a shonen anime that also vaguely reminds you of Lord of the Flies""",1
583,YUP! This was my thought after watching it!,1
584,two indians just casually building pools together 5 ft apart cuz theyre not gay,1
585,"Wrong channel, but same idea. And what's up with them always appearing in different channels that revolve around building lmao",2
586,"This looks great so far, the music was pretty clever, the stone turning scene was awesome, I have high expectations from this for this season!",2
587,You could say that  this season is exhilarating. ,1

589,Weekly Shounen Jump,1
590,"Yes, that confused me for a moment, and didn't recall this being a Wall Street Journal anime. xD",2
591,"I mean, who knows what the WSJ hides behind their paywall",1
592,"Ok, there has to be an anime about Wall Street now. If it doesn't exist, there needs to be one!",2
593,I think there was one that was basically financial Yu-Gi-Oh.  C: Control and Currency  or something,2
594,"Like others have already said it's Weekly Shonen Jump, the magazine where Dr. Stone and a whole lot of other popular series are published. One Piece, Black Clover, The Promise Neverland, We Never Learn for the current line up and Naruto, Shokugeki no Soma or Bleach among others for famous past titles.    Most of the time their series have lovable, kind of dumb with a heart of gold and brash main character but Dr. Stone went against that with a sarcastic, cunning and smart main character.",2
595,"Weekly Shonen Jump, where Dr Stone started publishing.",2
596,Weekly Shonen Jump,2
597,"hmm, why did the birds turn into stones, but other animals did not?",1
598,"From what we know in this episode, the person thing whoever that petrified human must have tested their power on the birds first as seen in Taiju's flashback.    Edit: some words",2
599,     This is taste of a   Liar   Stone...,1
600,Damn I must be hungry while typing that XD. Thanks for pointing out though.,2
601,"The birds were presumably the target of some sort of prototype test I imagine, which is why they were stone before the humans",1
602,"Yeah I was thinking something like that too. Like whatever that light was got the DNA sequence of humans ""calibrated"" wrong and the birds were the victims of that test",1
603,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     　        　                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,1
604,"Nobody knows, most probably because  ""The petryfing beam was aimed specifically at humans"" ",1
605,Found senku,1
606,"Obligatory, ""None of this has been hard confirmed in the manga"" comment.    But interesting theory nonetheless!",1
607,"I mean, that doesn't seem like it'd be true, considering the birds were being turned to stone before the light event which preempted the ground animals from turning to stone. If it was true then the events should have unfolded this way:    Light -     and not this:    Birds turn to stone -     So either there's a timing mistake by the writer  which  is  possible  or something else affected the birds first, before everyone else. Of course, all I know is what I've seen in the anime so far, so who knows what other information could change this perspective.",1
608,Then other humans survived?,1
609,"I quite enjoyed this first episode. I enjoy Senku more of the duo, he's likely to tease Taiju but he also respects trusts him enough to not be antagonistic. Plus, he's very meticulous, which is necessary since he wants to rebuild society and I can imagine that being a task on a very long timescale.    I'm very curious about how the mass petrification happened. I know it's the hook for the story, but I'm curious about if there will be a logical reasoning surrounding how it happened, why it happened, etc.",1
610,everything can be explained with science!,1
611,"Senku's the right type of guy to be in a post apocalyptic wasteland with. I like his phrase here, it's a good outlook.",2
612,This show is like hope punk personified and I love it .,1
613,Senku is so much fun. He knows and acts like hes the shit because he is. But he still see's the worth in others.,1
614,He comes across as cocky but not arrogant to me. He still values others I feel.,2
615,"Exactly. To quote the wiki ""He is confident in himself and has the ability to back it up. Even so, he never lets his confidence clouds his judgement or belittle those around him.""",1
616,"It's a good thing that his Judgement isn't clouded, because it would be a blow for humanity if the only 2 humans we know of at the moment being unable to follow through on restoring civilization.    That being said, I would enjoy seeing trials that test him.",1
617,Senku believes that he's the best at what he does. But he also believes that means nothing without the support of other people who are the best at what they do.,1
618,A Utilitarian stance then?,1
619,So he would probably like Mob.,1
620,"He also isn't  perfect  which is shown by the clay pot breaking down and him being really embaressed about it while building the 2nd one.     This is some top notch character writing already. I can tell this will be a good one.    Gave me Primitive Technology vibes, in the best way possible. Can't wait for ep2!",1
621,"I honestly don't think it was a mistake, considering what we know about it.",1
622,Especially when they were finding stone birds before.,1
623,I was afraid that Taiju was going to be super annoying just based off how the previews only showed him yelling nonstop. I think he might actually be my favorite over Senku,1
624,Taiju's definitely more heart of gold and less yelling than what the preview showed. I think they tricked us with that.,1
625,The convo between Senku and the other science nerds where he says he gave him the gasoline because he was 10 billion % certain he wouldn't have drank it was wholesome af. I really appreciate that being our introduction to these characters,1
626,It's rather funny that he ignited the gasoline without a care. I would be really cautious around it if I were in a lab.,1
627,"Him continually calling Taiju an oaf makes him seem like a dick though. Even though this is shonen, a little bit of comradery and a “sorry you didn’t get a chance to confess to your girl” would have gone a long way to make him more likable.",0
628,"I dunno, when your super close to someone, insults really do become terms of endearment sometimes. I feel like that solidifies how good of friends they were before the personification happened, since he had no qualms marching right into the science lab to tell Senku his plans.     Sometimes me and my friends jokingly insult each other, quite a bit but we 're still close friends.  of course there's a limit but ""oaf"" is the same as ""knucklehead"" to me... and I get called that frequently :3  ",1
629,If you can't call your boy a cunt every time is he really even your buddy?,1
630,"It definitely borders the line of dickery. I guess the VA's delivery made it seem more endearing to me, and that's why I'm fine with it.",1
631,"I kinda hate senku tbh. His design and personality are so corny it makes me feel a little sick. However, I do like his anime voice, which helps him a bit. I expected it to sound really bratty and grating to the ears because that's what he seems like in the manga.",1
632,"Sometimes corny hammy stuff has its own charm. In this case I liked it, although I can definitely understand your perspective: having been with him longer and understanding his personality more.",1
633,"I am very interested in the mass petrification as well perhaps down the line the plot can be a race against time to prevent a similar event reucurring. The word you used petrification really stood out to me I think that word relates to the word petrified which means to be so frozen by fear you cannot move. I think the green light reponsible for the petrification is  in some small part symbolic of the gorgon who turns others to stone by looking at them and the fact the light is green just like the gorgon had me seeing potential inspiration. Maybe turing to stone was some kind of defence machanism against ill effects of the light. You know what would be interesting, if the petrification had happened before they could relate it to greek statues in Dr Stones world. I'm rambling a bit but I would love to hear your theory if you have one.",1
634,"Every time I see Senku, he reminds me of leek. I can't unsee this.    I can't say I like both of their characters but the premise is very interesting.",2
635,"I knew that guy reminded me of a vegetable, but I couldn't put my finger on what TYPE of vegetable.",1
636,Yeah that's the first thing I though when I saw him. Also Yuzu looks really weird too. I don't like Senku because he's extremely arrogant and it makes it hard to watch. Both of them feel like the living reincarnation of the smart and muscle headed stereotypes which makes the dynamic between them hard to enjoy. The science and premise is nice though but this is definitely not for me.,1
637,We need a leekspin Senku gif.,1
638,He reminds me of Oddish,1
639,"I did not think they'd find the cure in episode 1, should speed things along!    Their dynamic is an interesting one, brawn and brain taken to the extremes almost. Curious to see how that develops.     Also anyone else prefer him with the beard?",1
640,he looks like a badass with a beard! caveman Taiju should have easily won Yuzuriha's heart.,1
641,Yes when your rocking a beard that well one should stay with the look.,1
642,"Surprised with the amount of time that passed, they couldn't make a decently sharp blade to shave his beard.",1
643,They made spears so I’m thinking clam shaver was just for laughs.,1
644,Trolling for sure.,1
645,"I love their dynamic. Senku is smug and ribs Taiju a lot, but you can tell they're best bros and Senku has a lot of respect for the guy.",1
646,"Senku is a great smart protagonist; he knows from the get-go that rebuilding society requires people of different mental and physical backgrounds and to be accommodating to their wants needs. But he'll still be a manipulative shit about it, and it's great.",1
647,This. Reminds me a lot of me and my bestie from a respect scale. We rib on each other all the time but I would trust her with my life and vice versa.,1
648,That madman did not shave. He used the shells as tweezers. TWEEZERS!,0
649,that's how real men do it,1
650,Who’s to say? The one with the beard might just be the other guys beard,1
651,    laughter ,1
652,"I expect things to get more complex. It was hinted that the process worked differently on different things. If we assume this was an alien attack then the birds could be a failed version of the attack. So the ""cure"" that works on birds may not on humans. I expect failure with the death of the person they test it on.",1
653,definitely should have kept the beard,1
654,"     I'm terrified of what qualifies as actually extreme in that degree then, lmao",1
655,"Its going to be insane, this is one of the few mangas i read, and its a very interesting and unique take on the  shounen trope.",1
656," they did justice  I'm so goddamn happy.    great OST, gorgeous backgrounds, 10 billion percent excited for next week.        hypeoverload      this is a great disclaimer ",1
657,  Please don't flame me but   I immediately thought Yuzuriha came from Yuki Seto's creations. She looks so different from the other characters in the series.,1
658," Boichi's female characters  in Dr Stone at least  look really different from his male characters for some reason. I find the female designs pretty offputting, but I guess some people like them.",1
659,"It's because the girls look exactly the same, but with varying hairstyles. The guys are a lot more varied which is a shame because there are some really cool girls in Dr Stone.",1
660,"I felt like a was watching a hentai due to her design, it was weird.",1
661,Someone said that the artist used to draw hentai and that's why.,1
662,She looks straight outta Stretta the Animation lol. Or any of those older shows like Accelerando or Stringendo.,1
663,I find it pretty good. Prevents those kinds of people making every female their waifu of the show or something stupid like that.,2
664,"If that was the reason why, then I feel there wouldn't be as much fanservice of the female characters.",0
665,This whole series looks so old school. Like old anime style but actually good looking and well animated,1
666,     Laughs in  Kohaku .,2
667,"     No joke, considering some of the stuff they do later on...",2
668,"Hell, even the stuff they did today. Mixing alcohol and nitric acid is no fucking joke. That shit is explosive if you get the ratios wrong!",2
669,"Considering that bat guano is literally an ingredient in explosives, yeah.",2
670,"Plenty of explosives use nitrogen in one way or another. N2 is one of the most stable molecules around, so it stands to reason that putting nitrogen in some precarious equilibrium in a molecule leads to it going back to its natural state  real quick  and with plenty of energy production when given the chance.",2
671,"I mean, it's niter. As in 7 parts in gunpowder. As in ""during the 1600s control of bat caves was considered a major national security thing in europe""",2
672,"He later uses it to make  ""nitroglycerin"" ",0
673,"Heads up, your spoiler didn’t work.",2
674,"Fixed it, turns out you need to be in markdown mode on new reddit.",1
675,And a reagent for fireball in DnD.,2
676,"yeah... I work at a lab that uses nitric a bit, and some exploded about a month ago.  Thankfully it was at night when nobody was near it, but it messed up that hood pretty badly, broke the sash off.",0
677,"Is it? I didn't know. I knew about Nital being used to etch grain boundaries in iron  I remember from college that's how you prepare metal samples for microscopy , but not that in the wrong proportions the mixture could be explosive.    Then again, nitric acid + ethanol... not surprising. Ethanol is a combustible and there's plenty of hypergolic oxidizers in rocket science based on nitrogen compounds, such as nitrazine.",1
678,"Yea, the trick is to keep the mixture at a low ratio of nitric acid to ethanol. If you go above 5%ish  going from memory here, take it with a grain of salt  it'll become unstable and the nitric acid will start oxidizing the ethanol.     If you go way over that ratio, by for example, pouring the ethanol into the acid instead of the other way around, it'll blow up in your face and splatter you with acid. Funtimes.",2
679,"The reaction creates ethyl nitrate, which has about half the explosive power of nitroglycerin by mass.",1
680,Warning: do not pour NO2 on humans lul,1
681,"lmao, the anime artwork of that exact frame looks identical to the artwork of hentai  Dirty Laundry, Mrs. Junkie. it looks so similar that could pass for one of scene from them.",2
682,What is that thing on her head? It's all I could think about when I saw that scene.,1
683,"I always saw it as a weird hairband accessory, but someone else in the thread said headphones, so I'm not sure anymore",2
684,That image is so full of meme potential.,2
685,I think she looks kind of creepy in that panel scene.,2
686,I wonder if it was really that necessary to show the shape of her pussy a few seconds before this cute scene,1
687,"I just watched the scene again a couple times and I sincerely have no idea what you're talking about. the closest thing was seeing the  backside of the front of her skirt,  which is definitely not her panties.",1
688,"wait, that's the inside part of the skirt?    i thought it was her panties...",1
689,"she's facing towards Taiju, so the  leg ass line is roughly like this  unless she's got a real bad case of Hank Hill ass.",1
690,Can I just say I love the level of critical analysis that went into determining exactly what we're seeing in this few-second scene.,2
691,gotta be in the right mindset for the science show!        mug7 ,2
692,"We are all  wo men of culture, after all",0
693,"yeah, i just realized it after reading your post. it's a nice detail imo",0

695,I guess she does have a hank hill ass then,1
696, r badwomensanatomy,1
697,If that's a pussy I don't know what I've been looking at my whole life.,1
698,Great 1st episode and a very catchy opening song.,2
699,I even enjoyed how they did the fast forward through their efforts in making wine.,1
700,"Seriously, the story boarding there was top-notch",1
701,"Same, I love how they made it look like a time-lapse!",1
702,"Brandy distillation, you mean. Making the wine didn't take long.",1
703,Yessir,0
704,OST sounded great too. Loved the song during their   training   SCIENCE montage.,1
705,"Writing ""E = MC²"" in his clothes is the anime equivalent of Leto-Joker's   Damaged   tattoo.",1
706,Anytime I see this equation on anything it just feels like a thing dumb people say to sound smart.    I like the show for the most part besides that.,2
707,I couldn't stop seeing it! It's so fucking stupid to put it on his clothes.,2
708,I am ten billion percent sure that I am really going to enjoy this series!     This is the easiest game of Spot the Protag I've played since I watched YuGiOh ,2
709,Haha its like they didnt even TRY to explain the Goofy hairstyles.,2
710,"i dont know, that one guy with the black uniform could have been one or that girl who isnt wearing a labcoat might be too.",2
711,So he survived through the power of boners?,2
712,3700 years of pent-up teenage hormones,2
713,The nut he busted upon awakening must have caused a tsunami,2
714,"Nah, he'll be saving for Yuzuriha. Imagine... 3,700 worth of it... Making glopping noises...",1
715,"Stayed hard for 3700 years and survived, fuck those commercials trying to convince me to panic over 4-hour ones.",1
716,We could say he was... rock hard.,2
717,He was rockhard before he was even turned to stone.,2
718," Why does Senku look like he was taken from Jojo?          That was a strong start! So what we have here basically are two dudes rebuilding civilization with Senku's brains and Taiju's brawns. I definitely like the premise and the mystery behind what turned everyone into stone and how the two of them survived.  Now that they have the ability to turn someone back I'm guessing the first order of business is to turn back Yuzuriha  was that Ichinose Kana or Yui Horie?   but looking at the OP she's still a stone so I'm curious what will they do with that ""cure"".     Now I kinda regret not checking this out when I first saw the first chapter over on r manga like a year ago. Oh well. At least I can experience this as a first timer. Definitely looking forward for more!",2

731,it looks like Leeks,1
732,I only read a little past this  maybe halfway into episode 2 if I had to guess  so I'm excited to see the rest of it now that it's clear this is a caring adaptation.,1

739,"Fun, looks like a definite one to follow along this season, I'm big on survival games so this is right up my alley.    Finding the cure in the first episode does mean that the pacing is going to be drastic in the following episodes with  presumably  them reviving lots of people since they need more manpower",1
740,"Yea, I’m anime only so I don’t know what happens next, but I believe in the next episode that they are going to try and revive Yuzuriha and the primal high school dude",0

742,They're not not going to make explosives.,2

The only person with weird hair. I like his personality though. He’s sharp but we know he cares a lot about our Big Oaf, if that what he actually calls him? I’m watching the Crunchyroll subs.     Look at this man.  That’s a godly beard. Where do I get these genes? For a second I thought even more time has passed when I saw that beard but it’s really only been another six months.     Mad man Senku did it!  My boi really bringing his game.    This was a really great episode. After watching the opening, I know I’m going to love this. It gave me nostalgic feels for whatever reason? but I’m hype.",2

769,So if I understand correctly they have survived because their brains haven't stop working. That is awesome.,1
770,"Not yet, but maybe soon.  And not really, they just survived because they got lucky enough to wash up by the cave and nitric acid slowly ate away at the stone until they broke free",1
771,Yeah but I think they mentioned that if they hadn't be conscious that acid wouldn't have help.,1
772,Not yet,1
773,Not sure if I have broke any of these rules I just wanted to know if I can expect some kind explanation in anime for my question. So it's not like spoilers where I ask specifically what happened.     P.S Thank you for warning I will know next time where to put these kind of questions.,1

785,     I felt like that too. They were so weird to me. I'm used to it at this point now though.,1
786,"Well, apparently the mangaka, Boichi, used to draw hentai or something like that, so that could be why...",2
787,"     I don't hate it, but I can tell something was off, just couldn't use the right word, or phrase",0
788,The girls look like porcelain dolls with bug eyes.,1

790,Whats wrong with the girls?,1
791,"Their faces are weird  I think it's the overly big irises and the small mouth , they all have the EXACT SAME face and body, and.....female bodies just don't look like that.",0
792,I mean how often are anime body types realistic.,1
793,"The females of Dr. Stone should be compared to the males of Dr. Stone, all the males have varying and unique designs and are very expressive.",1
794,Visually it looks great and I love both Senkuu and Taiju's VA. 10 Thousand yen says this will be one of the best anime this season.,1
795,Being conscious and unable to move for a couple of thousand years would drive everyone insane.   Completely bat-shit and incapable of any rational thought once freed.,1
796,"There's a thing called artistic license. If everybody completely lost their minds like what would happen in the real world, we would have no story. Even if it's unrealistic, it's fun that a super brainy dude and a super hyped-up willpower dude were able to keep their minds intact.",1
797,Yes but they were not conscious their brains were stone all the way though. So this has to be some sort of spirit type of thing. And it did seam the less intelligent thoughts might take centuries to form one word.   Now how does solid stone turn into normal human with a stone crust that when removed still has the same dementions is currently unexplained and outside of known physics.,2
798,"but the shows about SCIENCE and Senku said he's been counting the entire time, so that would mean that even longer would have passed  a few million years is what i think , that would be pretty interesting to see how animals would have evolved",1
799,This is the best Galacticraft LP I've seen yet.,1
800,well if you look at when Taiju freed himself the lines first came when the stones started to crack so maybe it's like an after effect of being stoned for 4000 years,1
801,I doubt we will ever find out what caused this event.,2
802,"this is very unique , no truck-kuns , no super human powers besides being smart . this is pretty freaking good so far . i think ima gonna go pick up the manga",1

807,Is Taiju Asta's brother or something?,1
808,If only Asta's VA were just as capable of yelling without being grating.,1
809,I dunno man Asta's VA is pretty good in Fire Force as the MC,1
810,Probably because he doesn't scream all his lines.,1
811,So that's why i liked his character so much!    Well that and he also reminded me to Hairo  buff hype man  from Saiki Kusuo.,1
812,That's it! That's the guy I was trying to remember that was similar to him. Been scratching my head for a while now.,2

815,"You know what? Before I watch this, the artstyle and character designs a bit bothering me, and make me wonder if I will like this show or not.    But with this 1st episode alone, not only I can look pass the artstyle, but somehow I even like it already lol     Really good 1st episode too. I'm hyped for the rest of the show now.",1
816, Awaken my masters intesifies ,1
817,"Ok, I'm upset by the fact that the meatheaded oaf chose to shave off his badass beard.    He just stopped looking like Hairo from Saiki-K. Why would he go back to that look?!",0

819,The first episode = great! Really pumped now.,1

821,"     I am just wondering how the fuck none of these two are completely insane, no normal human being would be able to not go crazy after thousands of years not being able to move or speak or anything... Probably we should just not think too much about it because otherwise we would realize that there are hundreds of things that should have killed them already while being frozen.",2
822,"The ""counting all the seconds"" thing is absolutely insane haha. Both of them should be unrecognizable as people at this point. If they did emerge they should be doing something like walking around mumbling to themselves. I was stunned that they remained conscious because that should be a massive plot hole alone. Their personalities shouldn't be intact. What fuel were their brains on too?    There's other stuff, like breaking apart doesn't work  broken stone people don't wake up it looks like , but the acid does? Why?    I'm guessing we'll get some answers, but the start is pretty weird.",0
823,"I think its more of a typical plot armour combinded with character traits. One is super smart, and the other is super passionate, that is the reason they stayed concious.",1

835,A shouty guy and the embodiment of I-Fucking-Love-Science. To be honest I'm not really feeling it. The setting is cool and all but the characters are totally not my thing. I'll give it a few more episodes to see if how they develop but I'm not expecting much.,1
836,Haven't read the manga but have been told by a lot that to essentially expect to sit through 4-6 episodes because the character dynamics drastically change for which to many of them consider the better.,1
837,"God I fucking love Dr. Stone. You know those sections of JoJo where Araki explains something like he clicked on a random Wikipedia page?

841,I've been looking forward to this show ever since it was announced. I'm so excited to watch this with everyone in the community. Let's go!!,0
842,Have to say it again. Great first episode. It looks amazing - feels amazing - it is amazing. I like Senkuu and Taiju as characters. Both a very charismatic. Rebuilding civilization looks to be an interesting journey with these two. Surely they are going to revive the wrong person that's going to cause them shit. I do however have many questions  like a tonne  so I'll wait for a few episodes to see if they are answered. 5 5,0
843,"50% of the episode is them repeating catch phrases, not a good start. I'll give it another one to see if the dialog writing gets better. The premise seems interesting at the very least and the characters somewhat likable even if a bit bland, if only as much work had gone into their personalities as their character designs.",1
844,"I don't even see the character designs as being good. Okay MC wears a labcoat and as if that's not enough, it also has ""E=MC2"" on it to even further push the ""HE'S A SCIENTIST"" down our throat.",1
845,"Ya I cringed a bit when I saw the E = MC 2, it's like the one thing people try to bring up in conversation once they find out you're a physicist, apart from that I felt that the braniac kid was still well designed, he has an iconic look to him, I wouldn't mistake him for any other character. The insert classic protagonist dude is another story.",0

849,"I love the first episode, but I think this could've been a better show if it didn't focus as much on Senkuu insisting everything is based on science. I mean... 3700 years and you're not dead from not eating, and your muscles don't atrophy? Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to nitpick on the science, but by having a character so hellbent on science it kind of lampshades things that you wouldn't even bat an eye otherwise.",2

851,"His point is that everything has rules that can be figured out. That's all that ""science"" is.",1
852,"It IS science. You can't say something is outside the bounds of science, science is merely explanation for known phenomena. If someone suddenly introduced magic to our world, it is still under science once it is studied and analyzed, like Senku is doing with the stone.

856,"Another thing is that the brainstorm aspect wasn't really shown. Knowing they came out from a stone shell, it should be logical to try to just break it open with a hammer and some makeshift chisel. Erosion is also not tested with some contraption to let it drip over time. It seems like ""science"" = ""testing one kind of solution for a year until it works"".",1
857,Did he? I thought the guy just ended up there. Senku should've put up signs at the cave if that was the case.,1
858,"yes, the guy was placed neatly on a stack of hay right under the drops. don't think that was coincidence, especially since we later found out that Senku also placed the cup in the cave to collect the liquid",1
859,"That's true, didn't think about that. There's still inconsistencies though, if it only took 6 months, they should've tried to find other places and put some people there to let it erode. You also don't necessarily need to use the stuff in the cave, though it might take longer.",2
860,"they dont have the manpower to look for other places. its why senku coudnt do much other than survive off the land until Taiju came to help with the surviving part and senku busy with the sciencing, since he'd rather find a faster replicable solution instead of a slower rarer source.    its why senku didnt find the grapes until Taiju came along to help",2
861,"I think we can assume from the shattered remains of people laying around that smashing wouldn’t work. And it’s probably also safe to assume that Senku tried that with some birds already too.     But yeah, this isn’t going to be real hard science or have a high degree of realism. Otherwise, there’s no way that Senku would have enough knowledge on all human knowledge to survive and he would likely be dead after six months due to lack of sanitation. Any cut or sniffle could be deadly for them.",1
862,Kid seems to be one of those prodigy's so I wouldn't be shocked if he prioritized immunization first.,2
863,"I'd guess that they didn't try the hammer method because some people were broken to pieces, that would just break and kill them.",1
864,"Well everything that can be falsified is based on science.  ""there are things that can't be explained by science"" is misleading, eather the idea can't be falsified and thus outside of science or it's more accurate to say there are things that cannot yet be explained by science. Traditional Magic in most stories is science thus the old wizard who has spent his life learning how to do it from books based on principles shared with others.      His solution was based on what might break stone but no reason to think it was going to work based on the broken in peaces people but you can say his method is scientific.   But they did not grow crusts of stone they were stone all the way though. So no need to eat and no muscles to atrophy. And cannot tell were the crusts came from as the person underneath seams to be the same size as the stone person so no room for a crust.   But this is episode one.   If making people stone is done by science it is very high tech level stuff.",1
865,THE MUSIC IS SUPERB!!!!,1
866,Taiju - I'm going to save Yuzuriha    Senku - I'm going to take the world back,0
867,"What a start. The premise and setting are highly intriguing, the two main characters make a perfect duo and are absolutely hilarious and there's so many directions this series can take. Also, Yuzuriha is an early candidate for best girl of the season  the magic of Ichinose Kana , everything looks great and the soundtrack is fantastic.     I already can't wait for next week.",1
868,READ THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MANGA A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE THIS AIRED AND IT’S SO GOOD!! JUST AS GOOD AS THE MANGA BUT MOVING WITH SOUND,0
869,...   Instantly read the mango after episode 1 like a big oaf ,2
870,"The premise is interesting, but unfortunately I can't say I really like either of the two main characters. They're both some shade of obnoxious, especially Senku. His ""ten billion"" shtick got old literally the second time he said it.  And the show already seems like it might be heading down the r iamverysmart road, which would make it virtually unwatchable",0
871,"he stopped saying it as much as time goes by, only when he's very confident about something. Idk if the anime would make it a catchphrase though.",0
872,"I honestly cannot understand why so many authors think ""fucking obnoxious asshole = genius""",0
873,How is he an asshole in any way? Did you watch the same show as I did?,0
874,"I mean, those traits aren't mutually exclusive.  He isn't even much of an asshole, he's just fairly cocky, which is completely reasonable when you have a trait that makes you objectively better then most humans.",0
875,It's a case of setting a shtick up to be recognizable. He stops saying it all the time later.,0
876,"It was the same for me too in the manga, but he stopped using it as often.   And I don't really understand what do you mean by this show turning into iamverysmart. But don't worry, it doesn't happen. Only if you think science is obnoxious in itself.",0
877,"Wasn't exactly hyped either, pretty mediocre so far",0
878,"Same for me. I liked the idea of humanity turned to stone and the MCs awakening a few thousands of years later to save them. But I really can't stand either of the two MCs, and specially Senku's 100 million shtick.    Definitely not for me.",1
879,"Thirded. Both main characters are defined by a single trait. They're obnoxious caricatures. I could stand the muscly guy, but the ""DAE Science"" guy I just hate.",0
880,Imagine thinking it's r iamverysmart just because science is the focus of the show,1
881,Except the show thinks itself to be really smart so its pretty much like those people on that subreddit.,1
882,It's literally an anime about SCIENCE wtf do you mean it thinks itself to be very smart? Not sure if you're just ignorant or if you genuinely think a show about a guy who wants to use science to rebuild a world is somehow pretentious.    On another note that sub is retarded anyways with how often they upvote obvious sarcasm,1
883," Seeing a bunch of highschool kids acting like know it all scientific geniuses makes it pretentious and cringey. I wouldny mind if the character was a well studied adult. I would be able to atleast take it more serious then.    Also the dumb sayiny by the mc is very cringy. ""10 billion percent"" lmao",1
884,"It's ONE dude who's a genius, that's the show's premise, if you don't like it then don't watch it. And he has a catch phrase so cringey amirite everything cringe btw. Get over yourself",2
885,"Damn, now I understand where the hype was coming from. This is fun. Really fun.",0
886,"Trust me my friend, it only gets better.",0
887,I guess you could say...    This is exhilarating ,1
888,Is this Civilization VII?,1
889,am i the only one who thought that was super underwhelming?,1
890,Nope. I really don't understand all the praise.,0
891,"This is my first exposure to Dr. Stone, and I'm really into it so far. Hopefully I can help you understand. Here's what I like so far: I dig Senku. I think science is awesome and it's great to see a protagonist who uses science to get what he wants. I also like the post-apocalyptic theme, and the mystery of how on earth it happened is interesting. And the idea of a super smart dude rebuilding technology and society from scratch is very exciting to me. Aside from that, there are the minor technical details, such as the art style, atmosphere, and soundtrack, which I am very much into all of.",0
892,"Eh, as usual, it's stuff for later in the manga and what the anime will adapt. Hard to understand the praise when you only seen prologue beginning of a show.",0
893,"Beginnings of things should be the strongest, to draw you in. It shouldn’t rely on a manga reader telling me how good it gets later.",1
894,I'm so tired of anime in general that anything with something weird will entertain me,1
895,"So these are purely my thoughts for the series:    - Straight out of the gate, they're talking about molecular structures of polyethylene and gasoline. If this keeps up, it's absolutely going to be too smart for me.    - Inversely, the bets on how hard he gets rejected are right up my alley. I can absolutely see my friends and I doing this with each other. We love taking the over or under on various things.    - The whole ""Love is timeless"" trope is a little overplayed these days in my opinion, so hopefully it isn't a major linchpin of the story.    - Not a fan of Senku being the cocky smart kid. I get the show is   Dr. Stone  , but you don't need to be a dick about it.    - This yelling is seriously going to be getting old if it keeps up.    All in all, the show wasn't  bad , I just hope the rest of the season isn't exactly like this. Of course, there's no way to tell right now.",2
896,Don't watch this if senku's cockiness turns you off that's just his character,1
897,I was going to give it the three episode treatment before I made an actual decision anyway. Maybe I'll get used to it.,0
898,"Damn I’m excited. This season is looking good by introducing mold-breaking shows like Dr. STONE. Not only are the stories interesting, but the animation is quality and so far the VAs are on point. Definitely gonna be hyped for Fridays for the next 3 months",2
899,"it's 25 episodes, so 6 months.",1
900,What a fantastic first episode! This was so good that it just makes me want to go and read the manga right away.,2
901,Mmm I honestly thought this anime was going to go in a different direction. I was kinda disappointed.,2
902,how did you think it would be?,2
903,"This is a shounen, right? I'm interested what the combat will look like. Will the power system just be science?     EDIT: Ok, so it's not combat-focused, my apologies. Most shounen are just a lot of fighting, so I assumed this one's the same. I'm still excited for it!",2
904,Shounen doesn’t mean only action with power levels,2
905,"I just mean I'm interested in how they'll fight, what methods they will use.    EDIT: Ok, my bad.",1
906,"They'll fight with their brains...no, seriously.",2
907,Shounen doesn't mean they'll even fight. There are plenty of shounen with no fights.    But I don't know if this is one.,2
908,Plenty ? I'm not saying it doesn't exist but most of them have a lot of action...,2
909,"Yes, but there is still plenty left that don't. I mean, I'd even say 20 is plenty, but there is probably more.",2
910,"Most sports shows, a fair few romances, and others",2
911,"Yes, there's plenty of them without it. Romcom, Sports, Comedy, Mystery, Adventure, Drama, etc. Shonen is just a demography and if it's not on Shonen Jump, a fair number of them won't be fighting, which even on WSJ, you'll find a fair number of comedy, romcom harem and other types.",1
912,Real Life Physics,1
913,It's shounen like Death Note is shounen.,1
914,"Just to get it out of the way now, Dr Stone isn't a battle shounen. Imagine taking the 'battle' away and put 'Science' in there.",1
915,"Okay, I'm looking forward to it then!",2
916,Seems like your set for dr stone,1
917,There's actually very little fighting in this series. It's more of an adventure series based around science and it's a lot of fun.,1
918,Sounds good!,2
919,"Think more of a themed show - like in Shokugeki no Souma they solve everything with cooking, in Yu-Gi-Oh with card games, etc., here it's science  mostly chemistry and engineering . There are some fights but most of the story isn't battlle-driven.",2
920,"Alrighty, sounds interesting.",2
921,The Promised Neverland is also shonen,2
922,There's alot of combat in the latter chapters I think?,2
923," ""There's even a fucking tournament arc at Goldy Pond"" ",1
924,"It's not about being about battles, it's about being on a magazine which is shonen..",2
925,Shounen is a lot more broad of a genre than you think. Hitori Bocchi and We Never Learn from last season are also Shounen.,1
926,"Shounen isn’t even a genre, it’s a demographic",1
927,They fight using the power of SCIENCE,1
928,"Shounen is a demography, so yeah, Dr. Stone is a SHonen as it's serialized on shonen jump. If you mean Battle Shonen, it's not one.",0
929,"I definitely didn't expect him to figure it out. I was thinking people would just randomly start waking up from their own willpower. Science won though, which is nice.",1
930,"Holy shit! That bird scene was really beautiful!          Can't wait for the moment Yuzuriha get out of the stone, hope they make it a great scene too.",1
931,My boy coming in with that celery hair.,1
932,Fuck I really want to read the manga now. Should I wait and enjoy the torture of a weekly anime or give in to my desires now.,1
933,That music during the montage was god tier.,2
934,"This show was one of the ones that I saw on Anichart and thought ""well, I'll give it a try, but it sounds like it won't be that great.""    This show was one of the ones that I was    absolutely completely fucking wrong about   .  It's jumped to the top of the shows I'm hyped about this season, and that's really difficult to do with Accelerator and Takagi also airing this season.",1
935,"Alright, I am SO hyped for this anime. That was an incredible first episode. I love how the characters didn't outright lose hope, they are determined. I love Taijo's pure LOVE just keeping him going. We didn't even see much of Yuzuhira.    The real winner of the show though is Senku. I freaking LOVE his attitude about things. ""We're gonna sprint right back to the top"" I. LOVE. THAT.",2
936,"A year ago, I would have never believed that I would like anime about two guys in the wilderness trying to increase human population. Remember christians, it's Tanku and Senku, not Adam and Eve!  These were their names right?      ;    Alsu Senku looks like  a fucking celery. ",1
937,He reminded me of Leafeon from Pokemon.,1
938,"I don't really get how they stayed conscious and alive during all that time, but I guess we're not supposed to think about it too hard. I mean, Senku was  accurately  counting seconds for 3700 years.    But when we got to the part where they are creating things all survival-game-like, I was hooked. The premise kinda feels like a  r WritingPrompts post.",2
939,So the dude got cockblocked by literally the will of the universe.DAMN that's a new record.,2
940,"guy with long hair - CLEARLY EVIL. every anime if a guy looks like that e.g agon in eyeshield, they are always freaking bastard.         Episode was great I loved the whole science take on it, trying to rebuild society I cannot wait to see them build their own little city.     I expect that they will have to like fight other cities etc eventually similar to zombie and other apocalypse themes where the survivors have like 1 city each to try and control and want more land etc.     There is no way just these two guys would break free only in Japan, surely other people are free around the globe as well and some evil door is likely close to them in Japan.          I am guessing they will break long hair guy free them self do and REGRET IT - but he is probably no the main evil, I mean the whole stone incident has to be some evil plan right, like someone who is in a bunker somewhere that tried to do it to control the planet or something.",1
941,"He has the formula for mass-energy equivalence on his shirt? That's the sort of thing that happens when a scientist character is written by an idiot. They just shoehorn in the only equation they know because math is a Smart People Thing.    Then again, it is also exactly the sort of thing you would expect from someone dorky enough to use the phrase ""ten billion percent"".",0
942,The formula will actually be at least a bit relevant soon enough.,0
943,Am i the only only one who thinks Senkuu's hair looks like a radish?,1
944,"Senku has to be one of the most original characters in manga and now anime, of the recent years.",0
945,"I'm not getting the praise at all. The basic premise is interesting, but then it's immediately undercut by being painfully shounen. Bad, ludicrous character designs; cliched, obnoxious characters; everything happens because they're  ganbare  as fuck... Yeah, no.    More focus on the petrification mystery, how the Earth has changed, and decent, adult characters could have made this interesting, but instead it's just another teenage power fantasy about saving the world and getting the girl.",0
946,"Completely agree. IDC about the shounen here really. Having a love story being his motivation to stay focused is fine, but I would have liked more focus on how they develop technology and their plans for the future. Still got to give it a few more episodes to really get going though but the ending doesn't look promising lol.",1
947,"I really just wish it was a seinen show. No outlandish character designs, super intelligence, dumb jock, or anything else. Just a couple of people trying to survive and solve the mystery of the world. A lot more grounded across the board.",1
948,You sound like the type of guy who gives scathing reviews on almost every anime based on the first 3 episodes and makes sure to preface it with how he's seen over 500 anime and knows what he's talking about.,1
949,LOL rt what an L,2
950,Bruh its just the first ep chill out,2
951,"holy shit that was so good. I'm hooked, can't wait to see what's next.    also, am i the only one who's suddenly in the mood to play Minecraft?",1
952,Yes.,1
953,I cant find it on vrv which has Crunchyroll on it. Any help?,0
954,VRV may not have Crunchyroll simulcasts. I'm not sure. It is DEFINITELY on CR the 2nd episode airs Friday at like 10:30am EST? or close to that time slot.,1
955,Just gonna throw this out there - Senku’s hair looks like leeks XD,1
956,"Damn what a major cockblock    I like Senku already, and Yuzuriha's character design reminds me of Chelsea and Asuka lol",1
957,I can't stand  his yu gi oh hair,1
958,i love the dynamic between the main characters!,2
959,"based on the opening, it seems pretty easy to guess : ",1
960,"saw this thread and went straight to watch this episode. Thanks, r anime i am hyped for this",1
961,Pretty good first episode. Seeing them come up with a way to make and distill wine was really cool to see. I like the relationship between the two main leads.,1
962,For manga readers? Does this have a lot of slice of life fantasy elements to it? So far its pretty good it reminds of stuff like made in abyss and the ancient magus bride,1
963,"No real fantasy elements at all. The mass petrification is really the only big fantastical element in the series.    Though, there's lots of fun character interactions while Senku teaches the supporting cast about science-y stuff, so I guess you could count that as SoL type stuff.",1
964,"Recreating everyday technology with minimal resources will be a major focus of the story so you could count that as a sort of Slice of Life.    Fantasy, not much, it glosses over some or many details on some of the science stuff but is usually done to keep a good rhythm in the story, not coming up with solutions out of thin air or stuff that is not possible in any way. Only the petrification is at the moment the only really ""out there"" element.",1
965,Aah I love the soundtrack and the look of the show. They did the manga justice. Excited to see more.,1
966,"Makes me wonder, why the birbs turned into stone, but doggos were still okay  at least at the initial stage of the stonification ",1
967,They got black lines on there face after waking up I wonder if it will be significant plot point later on,1
968,"I can pinpoint exactly what, but I had more fun reading than watching. The pacing was good, the anime looks gorgeous... but idk, something feels off.",1
969,Seems alright. The music was pretty good,1
970,This show reminds me of a documentary; in which what would happen if humans disapeared. On the other hand I wonder how many casualties were there prior to the show starting point,1
971,"I will keep watching this from now on with the headcanon that Taiju and Senku fucked on that one year time skip since they are the new Adam and Steve, thank you very much.",2
972," Alright, Shirou, relax.     I found it peculiar that  besides humans  birds were turned to stone, but other animals seemed to be fine.",2
973,Mr. onion head is pretty smart.,2
974,This is gonna be a good show.,2
975,Rick & Morty meets Edward Elric.,2
976,Already a time skip on the first episode smh my head,2
977,Getting Prometheus and Bob vibes,1

979,"His haircut reminds me of Leek from Gantz, agh",2
980,"Ok ok, why were birds turned to stone, but not dogs wolves? ",2
981,Something that will hopefully be touched on later. That one bird that they've freed ain't going to last long alone though lol.,2

983,this anime is literally what happened to kars but to everyone,2
984, Two Autists running in the forest.,2
985,"So when are we gonna get ""Real Scientist reacts to Dr. Stone episode 1"" youtube video",2
986,I learned more about survival from Dr.stone than I did in school,1
987,Combine this with Sounan Desu Ka's teachings and you can survive anything!,0
988,The E = mc² is just there for easy recognition. It's there to make the show seem more sciency.,1
989,You don't say. Don't worry there will be more than enough well researched science.,2
990,Well of course. Other than the matter conversion involved in turning people to stone that equation is of no use. And he probably would have to be working on something like the Starship Enterprise to research that  And that is the short version of the full equation which is only possible for a object that is not in motion.,1
991,"Doesn't this thing already stopped making sense?    Why was the feather petrified? I thought only living things get petrified. Why were there boars roaming around, when living things got petrified? Or wasn't every living being petrified. But then why got all people petrified? Or .. you know what I'll say.    Skipping through the first winter like it's nothing is also lame. This would be the only really dire situation.    Giving the main character knowledge about everything is also kind of lame. It's the typical self insert story. Why not give him some areas, in which he has no knowledge of?     And the last question: Shouldn't be the main characters  body inside the school? That was at least his last position and knowing the way Japanese like to build their buildings he would be buried.",0
992,"     Seeing as how there's now a bunch of petrified people in the middle of a forest, and thousands of years passed, I'm guessing the city is just gone by now. A lot can happen in 3.7k years. It's not like the landmasses would change much, if at all, but I'm sure earthquakes and floods and stuff could move you pretty far if you're encased in stone for that long.",1
993,This answer is completely off the mark. Imagine what would happen to the school building and everyone inside it.,2
994,"I haven't read the manga but I'm going to speculate a little. I would bet they will explain why there are deers and boars and other animals roaming around in future episodes.  I'm also going to take a bet that our main protagonist knows a lot about science but will need to learn about simple things  like friendship or love . I think it's crazy to say the show doesn't make sense when they have explained nothing so far in terms of what actually happened.     Them skipping the first winter imo didn't matter much. It seemed like they were able to stockpile wood, food and have a shelter plus I would think they would have prepared for winter to come seeing as he acknowledged winter being dangerous earlier in the episode.",1
995,"     Normally, I would complain that the other character had to ask why boars are still living, but since his main trait is ""being stupid"", it is not allowed and there is no reason for Senkuu, who already lived there 6 months to explain it randomly to him. So, yes there has to be more characters and another situation, but I don't see any reason not to add that there except for ""explaining was forgotten first"" or ""trying to add a bit of mystery"". Using the latter option is  in my opinion  wrong, since it is a superficial way for adding additional layers. Good ""mysteries"" show you everything. One thing which is so annoying about the original Sherlock Holmes - he sees clues but the reader only get them at the end of the story.         This is adding things and explaining points for yourself. Do you do that often? Does that mean that you only have to watch the last episode of anything to explain everything yourself?",1
996,PogU here's hoping for a great adaptation,1
997,using twitch emotes outside of twitch WeirdChamp,1
998,I don't believe someone could stay sane for 3700 years or even count during that time. Hope there will be an explanation for that,2
999,Senku and Taiju are just insane. Insane dedication to science and insane willpower.,0
1000,"I thought it was great.  If when it's dubbed though, I'd so love if Dan Green voiced Senku. There's something about him that just says ""Yugi"".",0
1001,Well he and Atem should be about the same age.    Wouldn't be all that fair though if Senku played children's card games.,0

I can barely stomach Asta from black clover as it is.    Why oh why do they keep using that stupid stereotype !!!    Looks like an interesting show, but that fucking screamer idiot is a tough pill to swallow for me at this point in my long anime fan portfolio.",0
1004,"Cause he's not the protagonist and the author probably wanted to show a stark contrast between a typical shonen character and this series main character.      He later develops more but yeah these type of characters do rub people the wrong way, especially if they watched too much anime.",1
1005,Guilty as charged.  Some days it takes me many multiple hours just to find something decent that I haven't watched before.,2
1006,"Yeah I understand that it's a Shounen so it's targeted for a young audience but it's just literally the same character. It feels so dumbed down so the idiot audience can understand it. ""Don't think too hard about this character, he's just like the one from the last anime you watched! Funny right!?""    To make the contrast SO brain dead is just insulted. Like hey, can you spot the main character? ",0
1007,How the fk does someone survive being frozen like that for so long? Like don't you need to poop and pee at all?,1
1008,It's something that will probably be revealed later on. If they spill everything in the first episode then there's no point of the anime other than fight the evil guy or phenomenon that caused this.,1
1009,"tbf if you don't eat drink, you don't need to poop pee either, since there's nothing to excrete....    There's still the problem of what was frozen with them but hey.

1012,I really think its one of those things where its best not to think about it.,1
1013,We have to allow the story to go on as you can't think with a brain of stone. So that thinking has to be on spirit level which is not necessarily unscientific if you go to high enough technology level.   We just have to wait to see if the story explains things later.

1020,While the direction is bland and the animation is stiff. The god tier designs and line work with some amazing background art and music make this one of the stand-outs of this season. And the manga content is good enough to make this anime a classic.,2

1023,"I can't even see a way in which that is an important spoiler lol, but alright, i tagged it",1
1024,Why would anyone think it is going to be the new evangalion?,1
1025,That OST was awesome! I'm going in completely blind for this show but I know that it is really popular with manga readers. Can't wait to see where this goes!,1
1026,10 BILLION PERCENT gonna be my best for 2019,1
1027,man I'm really happy the guy from primitive technology got an anime about him.,1
1028,"So can anyone explain why the illustrator, Boichi, made his hair like a spring onion?",2
1029,why not lol.  nah there was no explanation ,1
1030,"So it really was just a creative liberty, I assume.",2
1031,Yeah just hair being anime.,1
1032,Just by watching this episode my guess is that he tested something on his hair and it got that way.,1
1033,"This anime isn't half bad. I liked the music, and I liked Senku's character design. First episode doesn't have much action but I still enjoyed it. I will definitely keep watching!",1
1034,This first episode has set the bar high for Dr. Stone!   I am now 10 Billion Percent invested in this anime!     Voice Acting 10 10  Animation 10 10  Music 10 10  Pacing 10 10,1
1035,dang I heard a lot of mixed opinions on this so was expecting it to be ok but it was REALLY good and REAAAALLLY unique for a shonen.,2
1036,"I am now sure this adaption will be great, 10 billion percent..",0
1037,"Glad that on this final JoJo friday, we get some good stuff to fill the void.",0
1038,"Damn muscle man really likes his screams and Science likes being cocky.           But its a nice duo          The artstyle in the beginning reminded me a bit of an old shoujo anime, but overall I love the clear lines            Curious on how they will keep carry on from now on, now that they can reverse the  thing  that happend",0
1039,"I mean, they can reverse the petrification, but they can't reverse it for 7 billion people on their own, or the 3700 years of nature reclaiming the Earth.    There's plenty more directions for the story to go.",1
1040,The opening is meh,0
1041,Everyone trying to turn this into Yaoi is annoying,1
1042,"Exactly, there's nothing gay about two dudes living in nature together",0
1043,Shipping will always be a thing. Let people have their fun.,1
1044,"Am I the only one who thinks this show is stupid? I can't be the only one. He has E=mc2 on his clothes and that alone is supposed to scream ""science"". Are you people sheep?",1
1045,"Are you one of those r iamverysmart tools? I agree that stuff like the formula is stupid but that is a minor issue. Havent seen it yet so I dont know if it is good but complaining about something so minor is petty and ridiculous, if you are so picky to make that a massive turn off, that is fine, but dont whine like a petulant child and call people sheep because others enjoy the show and dont care about something so irrelevant.    Any science themed show cant go into massive details anyway. The formula is famous and it is an easy way to portray 'science dude' to people who are ignorant to much of science and that is the majority of the world. Going any more complex than Steins Gate is going to make your show a flop, too few people would understand and enjoy it and yeah, the science in Steins Gate isnt at all hard to understand even for people outside of science. It is also a timesink to try and be very scientific in an anime so you wont see it in anything but LNs.",1
1046,Kid that is crazy about science decides to print one of the most fundamental things about the physics that make up this world on his clothes.    How can this be?,0
1047,"If you claim to be interested in science you'd understand just how much there is behind this little formula and how many things had to be uncovered before it's discovery was even plausible. Hence you'd understand how wearing it as sort of a nice quote on your clothes is the laziest possible way to honour it's meaning and the people behind it. I don't want to sound like I'm gatekeeping, but science is innately complicated and almost any attempt to simplify it goes against it's methods. This show is meant to be impressive and has little to do with how science work. The idea of it like, but the way it's made puts me off",1
1048,"So lets say that you where him and wanted something signifying your passion on your clothing? Would you print an entire book on the scientific method on it?    Its a fricking emblem.Emblem are suppose to be simple, it doesn't matter if the things they symbolize are not.",1
1049,"The graph of a hyperbola isn't a bad emblem for example. At least it doesn't scream the same way E=mc2 does, now they you can see it basically everywhere",1
1050,"You... REALLY think you’re smart, don’t you?",1
1051,Hes a scientist. Why wouldn't he imprint one of the most fundamental formulas of science from one of the most famous and well known scientists in the world when reforming society?,1
1052,"It's statements like this, that put me off anything with a ""scientific"" theme",1
1053,"If it makes it better, there is a reason why he had the equation that is not just to ""scream science""",1
1054,Opening: animation- non existent. Art- GODLY AWESOME OMG DOWMDJWJKDDHKKFJSNEKDFJ DAMN WOW,1
1055,I like it    Would have loved to see more of the experimenting thought. Not much 3 minutes would have been awesome.,1
1056,Loved Senku. Thought it was an interesting first episode. Show was definitely hyped up a lot. Very interested to see where the anime goes from here.,1
1057,Oh man I cannot wait to begin this. You people are in for a great ride.,1
1058,Is it explained later on whether other animals were turned into stone as well? Coz I found it weird that some birds were the only ones that got turned into stone along with the entire human race.,1
1059,"Ahh yes, Taiju the manliest man in history who shaved by pulling out each indivudal hair with clams.",1
1060,I can tell my brain is gonna expand tenfold after watching this whole thing,1
1061,I liked it.,1
1062,"The hype for some hardcore science has never been GREATER 10 billion percent exhilarating!!!    I can't fucking believe i'm finally seeing Senku in all it's animated glory, this is my 2nd anime with a previous manga that i previously read and still reading week after week.",1
1063,Great beginning. Opening song was amazing. All in part from a great manga.,1
1064,"Man, i hope that they're actually able to revive yuzuriha. But the op makes it look like they wont be able to do so for a while. also the long haired dude seemed to have a real knack for smashing petrified people, I hope that taiju's dream doesnt get ""shattered"".",1
1065,"That was a fantastic first episode. The premise itself is so unique and interesting, but what really made this episode for me and cemented Dr. Stone as a show I'll keep watching is Senku. He's undoubtedly my favorite part of the show so far, I love everything about him, from his way of speech to voice acting to character design to entertaining personality. I'm hyped for the rest!",1
1066,Bruh get gotta put a fucking disclaimer at the end lmao! But really good episode tho,1
1067,"I knew I recognized that voice, fucking Shirogane.",1
1068,"Gotta say the hype is real. The show brings quite a different story and both the direction and animation was on point. That timelapse scene was great and also the jokes were quite good given the context.     The protagonist seems pretty smart and meticulous. His eccentric personality is enjoyable.    And the best part, this show is like nerdgasm for geeks out there including me.",1
1069,"Damn, this is so good that I'm going to read the manga right now.",1
1070,"If you all thought Yuzuriha was beautiful and sexy, get ready for some of the most insanely gorgeous  and sexy too  waifus of this year in anime.    Are we going to have a peek at  ""best gorilla""  next episode?",1
1071,"""Anime, I've come to bargain""",1
1072,I am 10 billion percent sure that this series will be exhilarating.,1
1073,IT'S 10 BILLION PERCENT HEREEEE     ;    MY SCIENCE OVERLORD SENKU,1
1074,"This was a fun episode. I really hope that this sets the stage well for the rest of the show. Good chemistry between the 2 dudes and I can't wait to see them tackle more and more problems as ""civilization"" continues.",1
1075,"So far so good, Really good manga and the adaptation looks spot on this will be a fun ride",2
1076,Looks promising,1
1077,The first episode was solid . The visuals were absolutely stunning. Dr.Stone could make a really strong case for anime of the year depending how everything plays out,1
1078,"Senku's hair looks a lot like a vegetable.    Aside from that though, great start! I really enjoy friendship between Senku and Taiju.",1
1079,Is it confirmed to have 24 episodes?,1
1080,"OHAYO SEKAI!!! GOOD MORNING WORLD!!!! damn, op is lit.. the whole episode is very good! I think I'm gonna like senkuu so much.. but I really can't stop thinking about his hair.. looks like a vegetable and makes me hungry.. XDD",1
1081,Daikon Radish or a Leek. I get that feel.,1
1082,Amazing setting and interesting characters to follow. The mystery is interesting enough to make you want to continue. And the use and growth of scientific methods and just general intelligence is always fun and interesting to watch. I will not be missing this show.,2
1083,Great first episode. I'm hyped! :D,2
1084,"This is SOLID  no pun intended         Was a lot funnier than I expected too , this is 10 billion percent going to be an enjoyable ride!",1
1085,I am so excited for this season,1
1086,"Well, I surely couldn't tell which mushrooms are poisonous edible. And I play Super Mario a lot.",2
1087,The one he said looks like it came out of mario would have been a 1 up. SUPER TAIJU,0
1088,Why was that so good,1
1089,"The synopsis of this show did nothing to catch my interest. I'm so, so glad I ignored it and listened to a group of randos on the internet that told me to watch it. This show is 10 billion percent great!",2
1090,Is it on VRV?,1
1091,If they are gonna make a new civilization does that mean they are just gonna make some girls into s   slaves or how wtf are they gonna get more humans.,1
1092,"Looks interesting, been asking people on the Facebook crunchyroll what it’s about for months now and never a reply",1
1093,I'll surive. Even if it kills me!,1
1094,I've been waiting so long to see this great series get the anime treatment and it didn't disappoint. Perfect series to fill the JoJo shaped void on Fridays from now on.,1
1095,Only one song instead of two in a 24 minute episode means we got atleast a minute and a half of extra content compared to other shows. I for one welcome this new tactic for all shows :D,1
1096, I only now realized that Dr Stone is the work of the creator of Sun ken rock. The artstyle!,0
1097,"The writer from Eyeshield 21 and the artist from Sun Ken Rock, and they work extraordinarily well together.",0
1098,I really liked Eyeshield  T T,1
1099,Can’t wait but the premium prevents me from watching till next episode,2
1100,Can someone explain 1 thing to me? Won't they die of methanol poisoning from drinking that 'wine'?,1
1101,"Art was great but man, where was the animation and storyboarding? Almost no animation and storyboard was so weak.",1
1102,ITS FUCKING AMAZING  specially cuz of the manga,2
1103,I don't think I've ever seen a timelapse scene in anime.,1
1104,Great first episode! I don’t think I can contain myself.... I’m off to read the manga!,1
1105,"I feel this series is so good that even reading the manga you will be able to enjoy the anime, great comedy and characters and not over reliant on twists so even if you know what is coming it is still entertaining to watch them get there.",2
1106,Are you from the future? Is the manga good!?,1
1107,"The manga is very good and has had a pretty good reception since it started publishing. I mainly say it because it is one of the few I have enjoyed even re-reading it, also it has some of the best reaction faces I've ever seen.",1
1108,Thanks a bunch! Have a great day!,1
1109,In another addition of find the main character.....,2
1110,That outro song during the credits is SO GOOD I need it!,1
1111,Wow Sun Ken rock really turned a new leaf here.,2
1112,Does anyone have an idea why Senku's hair looks like a spring onion?,2
1113,AYAYAYA,1
1114,"I wasn't sure if I was gonna find it interesting after seeing the teaser on Crunchyroll but it was better than I expected, at least for this first episode. Definitely gonna keep watching!",2
1115,CIV speedrun lets go!,2
1116,So... Where are those buildings? All disappeared? Seems like science yeah,1
1117,Pretty cool first episode. This has potential to be really good.,1
1118,imagine the poor mf who got stoned while taking a fat dookie,1
1119,"Wasn't expecting much going into this, but I'm totally in now.",1
1120,Now this excites me.,1
1121,"I knew it was gonna be good but this honestly exceeded expectations, OP’s a banger too",2
1122,"Wow, I'm surprised by the number of spoilers by the OP.    I thought it would be a simple v1 until we reached the additional characters.",1
1123,"OK. Tbh, before start watching and during first  few  minute, I thought I'm not going to like this.    But, fortunately, this is actually entertaining and really good too. An interesting premise for sure. Another survival show this season for me.",0
1124,Wow this anime has such an original and refreshing concept for me. Rebuilding civilization once again from scratch with pure science is a very interesting plot. This anime screams HYPE to me haha.     I won't read the manga since I don't like to spoil myself for now ,1
1125,"""I'm going to beat fantasy with science""",2
1126,Any anime similar to this? I can't wait 7 more days lol,2
1127,"The educational all around science aspect seems unique unfortunately.    For the whole mystery, survival and adventure aspect there is Made in Abyss.     For building a civilization there is that time I got reincarnated as a slime.    For whacky protagonist hair there is Yu-Gi-Oh",1
1128,Season 0 YGO if you want Murder Ghost who does act more like Senku,1
1129,"SCIENCE, BITCH!",1
1130,All these survival games are ruining gaming! Wait what sub is this again?,1
1131,I was hyping it since I saw the preview and it was WORTH IT!! High expectations were fully filled!,2
1132,BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!! Hope it helps boosting their sales,1
1133,"I’ve been reading the manga since about chapter 30, so this has been a fun ride for me so far. Really liked everything I saw here, it’s a great start.",0
1134,"I really like what I've seen so far, including those little nuggets of scientific info. With such a strong first episode, I can't wait to see where the series goes from here!",1
1135,Science,1
1136,Taiju  spelling?  is the man I aspire to be.,2
1137,"Something about Yuzuriha's pre-stone face just puts me off.    Being indefinitely petrified while retaining consciousness is well towards the worst ""worse than death"" scenarios I can think of. Dunno how scientific it is for brain function to remain while the brain is literally turned to stone though. And where would the energy for all that thinking come from?    All clothing gone, but plastic headphones remain. Sasuga non-biodegradable plastics!    ""Don't hug me when you're buck naked!"" - he's not buck naked tho.    Depetrification also - it couldn't have been just the outer layer of stone covering the body as is, otherwise the shattered pieces wouldn't be stone all around. Also everyone would just suffocate to death within a couple minutes. But somehow ""corroding"" the outer layer is all it takes.    The OP sure is purrty.    The energy of the protags is what keeps it going, IMO.",1
1138,"just a question does the ""stonning""  lol  affect all living organisms ? cause I heard some birds and also vegetation wasn't ""stonned"" and also does it just cover humans in a stone layer or does it turn the entire body into stone",1
1139,"It turns them stone all the way through, and then they turn back all the way through, the ""shell"" is just a bonus in the ""thawing"" process. And even from the first ep we've seen that most animals came through it fine.",1
1140,so not all animals but most of them ? cause he had some stonned birds,1
1141,"Birds, yes. People, yes. Other creatures, ??",1
1142,good shit,1
1143,Yes. I don't know if it'll be useful to me but I've learned shit reading the manga.,1
1144,I love it already. The characters sound like they should sound.,0
1145,Worth the wait since 2017    Also read manga. Anime missed a few things or made it different,1
1146,The power of Science will save humanity,2
1147,This anime looks good.,1
1148,Damn didn't know we got part 8 Jojo animated already,1
1149,"I have a few questions about how they exist as humans now that I hope the show will answer eventually. Are they effectively immortal now? They were completely unchanging in the stone, and brawn guy then grew a beard after he got out. so does the rock somehow halt their aging process? also, what are those lines on their eyes? it wasn't there before the rock formed, so is it just a visual effect? I'm very curious to see what all happens along this line of inquiry.    This was a fantastic episode though, I'm super excited to watch the rest of this, as it definitely seems like it was the love child of civ and minecraft.",1
1150,"They never exactly explain the cracks so I don't  think  it's a spoiler, but basically revived characters tend to have some amount of ""accent cracking"" going on to give them some visual flair, but it doesn't seem to actually be a deep physical gap in their faces or anything.",2
1151,Seeing Senku animated makes me 10 billion percent happy. I've read the first 20 chapters of the manga and held back from going further because the anime was announced and I love the concept and humour so I'm definitely looking forward to this,1
1152,"This is so stupid, I love it.",0
1153,I’m just really excited to see all of Senku’s triumphant moments in animated form,1
1154,Why did only birds and humans petrify?,2
1155,What a great first episode. I'm seriously tempted to just start reading the manga right now so I gotta control myself.,2
1156,"Did not care for this one at all tbh. The characters didn't really do anything for me, and at this point that's all the show has going for it.",2
1157,So. Any reason they didn't try to go to the cities? sure shit was all kinds of fucked up and plant life everywhere but im sure they could've found some stuff in the ruins.    Great first episode nevertheless. looking forward to where this goes.,2
1158,The tree he found was in an intercity school. Even the cities decayed to practically nothing. They are in downtown Tokyo.,2
1159,Why is it they were fully clothed when turned into stone and their clothes fell off over time?,1
1160,Clothes decay quite quickly. If you put your clothes on a statue and just left it in the elements for even a few years they would be rotted junk.,1
1161,Weren't they also made into stone though?,1
1162,Nope. Only the people.,1
1163,"Gotta love the italians at the start  when they're turning into stone  being dubbed saying just ""Mario! Mario!"". Talk about stereotypes lol.",1
1164,"Wow. That's how you start a series. The potential for this series to continue even further than some other shounen is massive if the author decides to do so. Perfect blend of comedy, progression in the plot, and information. I'll probably end up reading it because screw waiting weekly. I need my dose",1
1165,I am hyped.,1
1166,"This is an interesting premise, and while the characters didn't immediately make me fall in love, I will absolutely see where it goes.",1
1167,"Before, I was skeptical of this show...     BUT NOW IM 10 BILLION PERCENT HYPED",1
1168,If I had to describe the show in three words. THIS IS EXHILARATING!,1
1169,So I guess they're gonna have to science the shit out of this situation.,2
1170,Senkuu is such a badass,2
1171,Massive fucking hype. When I started reading the manga I just started at what was the current chapter at the time. Time to see how this all started.    Aaaah Senku's voice is way different from the one in my head.    The dog didn't turn to stone?    This motherfucker stayed conscious during the thousands of years he was turned to stone. We should all aim to be as badass as Taiju.    The fuckin mushrooms that look like they're out of Mario are the poison ones. Mario is fucked.,1
1172,"I was super hyped about this series and now I can say I'm definitely sticking with this series!!    I feel bad for Yuihara poor gal must want to break free, Big Oaf for best bro!!    The part with the wine was very interesting, I sort of geeked out at that since my dad works at a restaurant and is bit of a wine connoisseur so learning about this was cool.",1
1173,This anime is gonna be lith,1
1174,AWAKEN MY MASTERS!!!!,1
1175,This giant green onion is cool I guess,1
1176,I was hoping this anime would have more of a Made in Abyss Girls' Last Tour kind of vibe but the anime seems pretty goofy instead.,1
1177,Look forward to some BAAAAD experiments as the story progresses!,2
1178,All in all this is a very good adaption that is faithful to the original art as well. Can't wait for episode 2.,1
1179,"Fantastic score, and solid animation. I read up to about chapter 60-ish of the manga, so I'm pretty hyped to see some science get done.",1
1180,"Ok we all say that the gods be the cosmic cock blockers, but can we talk about our only true friend and wingman:     Tree-kun.     He making sure the girl safe and sound and all because of a gentle kindness she did.     We salute you Wingman Tree",1
1181,Tree-man is not like Truck-kun.    Truck-kun got stopped and crashed cause the whole damn world got Isekei'd,1
1182,"This is right up my alley, I was hoping that first episode would just keep going and going.",1
1183,"Holy shit I didn't realize this premiers today. So fucking excited, Dr. Stone is my favorite ongoing WSJ manga and I can't wait to see how they adapt it",1
1184,Very interesting premise. They wasted no time with the pacing. And I love Dr. Stone's anti-hero qualities already.     Buff dude is a little shone cliche but whatever.     Looks really promising!,1
1185,I never gave a fuck about this series before but i think it's time to take a Very good look now.,1
1186,"Well, that was really fun. Extra points for Ichinose Kana, I love her voice <3",1
1187,I am 10 million percent sure I have a rock hard boner after watching the first episode.,1
1188,The first thing that came to my mind when Senku built the house was “ he probably watch those indians build them “ lol,2
1189,"Loved the episode. Wish Senku's hair was a bit toned down though, seems out of place...",1
1190,"If there’s one lesson we can take away from Dr Stone, it’s that booze has the power to save all of humanity",1
1191,why would birds and people be the only one's getting turned to stone? We see all the other animals are fine except just those two,1
1192,Mysteries. . .,1
1193,"Never heard of the manga, never read it. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode here.    Anything that has a unique premise, I’ll give a shot, and I love the setting of Dr. Stone itself. The idea of essentially rebuilding humanity with contemporary mindsets is fascinating, and it’s clear that it presents both drama and comedy.    Senku is a unique protagonist, to say the least. While he’s clearly a bit mad, it’s not like he’s villainous, judging by how he wants to rebuild the world. It’s just that he goes about it differently than, say, Taiju would. He is definitely more of what I would consider a traditional protagonist, as he has someone he loves that serves as his motivation. I also like the dynamic that Senku and Taiju share. I’m a sucker for a brains and brawn partnership.    Great first episode all around, and that theme is a lot of fun to listen to. Just a little aside there. Definitely keeping up with this series.",1
1194," YEAH, SCIENCE BITCH",1
1195,MAshallah,2
1196, My impression of this show ,2
1197,That was really interesting!    And that breakthrough at the end was uplifting and really drives the potential of this story.,1
1198,"Nobody gonna mention how that poor little dog probably stood trapped with his collar until he died of dehydration? Well unless he managed to tip his owner over so her hand broke.    Really interesting show though, will most certainly watch more.",1
1199,Or pulled out of his collar. Or chewed it off.,1
1200,THE FUCKING ANIME IS HERE? SO SOON?,1
1201,"MO'FUCKING DACTA STOOOOOOOOOOOOONE!  I always name the series this way.     It's time for you guys to finally grasp the wondrous power of science!    It's always nice to immerse yourself in a friendly montage. With enough work, you'll accomplish your goals.    You also can't go wrong with using love to keep your consciousness going. That also helps...",1
1202,"This show peaked my interest a while ago when i saw it on upcoming in MAL, watching episode 1, I can already tell that this is going to be one of my favorite of 2019",2
1203,"Been hearing a lot of hype for the manga in the past year or so but never got around to reading it. Seeing it now, I can sorta see why it gets mentioned a lot. The story seems really interesting, with a mix of education and mystery. The character design though, goddamn. Dr Stone looks like a mix of all badass shonen characters turned up to 11. I love it! The character dynamic between the two goofs were fun to watch, and the humor was right up my alley. Can't wait to see how they go from here.",1
1204,It looks to be a good adaptation of a fantastic manga but I just hope the first arc ends soon as most people when entering the manga considered it the worst part of the series.,1
1205,Anyone know where I can watch it for free on my phone? Lol,1
1206,"he counted second by second for 3700 years, longest training arc ever",1
1207,I kinda wanted to have a more stylish scene at the end with a bird. Its the pivotal moment of them turning this stone world back and it just looks the same. Still a great episode and im loving the style is does have.,1
1208,"Not the usual kind of show I'd watch, but glad I gave the first episode a shot, this pretty weird and a lot of fun!",1
1209,It feels like a good 3700 years from the time it was announced,1
1210,"The disclaimer at the end was funny  and necessary, given what sorts of things they will be creating in this series ",1
1211,"Ah, finally the most hyped anime of the season  seriously, Crunchyroll and VRV have been pumping the hell out of this show  is here.     And the first episode delivers. This is definitely “pop-science the anime” which means we’ll be skipping all the problems and challenges that will make the possibility of two modern dudes surviving in this situation impossible. And Senku is a dick to his boy Taiju.     But still, the hotblooded SCIENCE! of it all still hits the spot. I’m definitely curious to see where this goes. If all it takes is the acid to free people it seems like the problem of recreating civilization would be at least partly solved so I’m sure there’s more to it.",1
1212,That was like Jojo meets real-world science and I thoroughly enjoyed it,1
1213,Great start!,2
1214,"I honestly wasn't even following when this show was gonna air. It wasn't on my radar because Senku's hair looks really weird even for anime. Like a green onion or something. But I saw it premiered today so I gave it a chance, and I'm so glad I did. The quality was like Jojo-tier and the science twist is just perfect and very realistic. They tried to do this approach with Makai Ouji: Devils and Realist but that fell apart after a few episodes",2
1215,This was a dope first episode. The manga is absolutely fantastic and I love how colorful and beautiful this world is in the anime!!,1
1216,"Great start, I'm just glad Boichi finally got an anime. This man's work is spectacular. Shout out to Sun-ken rock, fucking spectacular.",2
1217,"So a question to someone more knowledgeable, what are the chances of books with our current knowledge make to this era?",0
1218,"None, paper would be ruined in years, not even decades. Even carefully preserved they would not last centuries. The only books likely to survive would be those under extreme preservation like in sealed vaults, and even then, maybe not. Thousands of years is a long time in an active environment.",1
1219,Stone free lmao,1
1220,So this is Primitive Technology: the Anime?,1
1221,Sucks to be in a plane when everyone gets turned to stone.,1
1222,"Better than being in a plane when everyone gets snapped, and then waking up 30,000ft over Nebraska.",1
1223,Just like what happened during the Blip.,2
1224,IT WAS SOOO GOOD!! Fantastic job with the adaptation!,1
1225,Anyone else think senku looks like satan soul mirajane?,2
1226,Coming into this after hearing about the Manga shortly before the anime was announced but never reading it. Holly shit is this show amazing just based off this first episode I love it already can tell it will be my favorite of the summer season.           Also thanks for teaching me how to make alcohol,1
1227,Primitive Technology: The Anime,1
1228,"..so this show is basically,    ""Primitive Technology the anime, but what if the guy was going to Primitive Technology step by step into recreating civilisation""?",1
1229,This is Chad and incel solidarity,1
1230,This has to be the coolest premise for an anime I've seen in a long time.,1
1231,100% watchlist,1
1232,"It's an amazing anime, i'm thinking of reading the LN or the manga if it has one.",1
1233,"The manga is definitely worth reading. The anime should be good, but the manga has better art and probably snappier pacing.",1
1234,This is based off of a manga. Chapter 112 just came out today. It's a fantastic read so far.,1
1235,I have already read the manga in just 2 days xD    I can't believe how i read 112 chapters in 2 days!    Truly a superb manga it is.,1
1236,Taiju's laugh is the best lol    I am very excited by this first episode. exciting things to come,1
1237,Adaptation of Wall Man when!,1
1238,"senku's hairstyle is so weird! the result of an experiment gone wrong? speaking of which i love how science-y this has been so far, although  it's strange how their bodies could be preserved within stone for so long. maybe that's what they're going to explain once they find out every thing behind this mystery.    enjoyed the dynamic between the main duo in this episode too. wouldn't it have been interesting if they were originally archenemies or something? but i guess it's peaceful that they were already friends before they became stone. looking forward to more!",1
1239,"They weren't just covered in stone, they 100% became stone, but then 100% became human again, with a stone shell cracking off. You can tell this from the ""broken"" people, they aren't just hollow like pottery, they are chunks like statues. It's a weird, semi-magical effect, and pretty much the only ""sci-fi"" in the show.",1
1240,oh! i guess i misunderstood because of how they showed the bird emerging from the shell of stone after they poured nital  ?  on it,1
1241,"Yeah, and Taiju also had a ""shell,"" but that's just part of how they come out, I mean if their shell was actually the outer later of their bodies then they would come out looking like the female Titan. They are stone solid through, but then when they turn back to meat there is some sort of shell left behind.",1
1242,I really enjoyed the time lapse of them working. Felt innocent and fun seeing two bros working together to solve the world's mysteries,1
1243,"This was an extremely solid opening episode showing some great animation and bringing forward some interesting characters and a unique setting, I can't wait to see how this series continues, although I can see the whole ""big oaf"" thing getting on my nerves if this series ends up as a long running shounen.",2
1244,"I wasn't really impressed by reading the synopsis, but watching it unfold proved quite a bit better.     Not as hyped about it as people here seem to be, but it's worth trying a few more episodes.",1
1245,"I don't know how well the anime will do, but the manga is consistently entertaining. It might sag a bit over the next few episodes, but give it at least a few more if you find yourself losing interest, it ramps up.",2
1246," I am 10 billion percent sure"" it will teach me things that I didn't get in my chemistry class and it is going to be a great show!",2
1247,"Minecraft, the anime",2
1248,"This first episode pretty much nailed it in every respect. Now I wait for the most crucial my favorite aspect of Dr. Stone: ""Do they nail the reaction faces?""",1
1249,"MESAMETAE, WAGA ARUJI TACHIYO!!!!!",1
1250,"Anyone else getting Jojo vibes from the show? Specifically Senku really feels like he's right out of a Jojo gang, or possibly a Jojo villain.",2
1251,"Guys why is the episode so fast?    6 minutes into the show I thought my player was at 2x or that I was watching a ""cut version""    Was it on purpose?",1
1252,The manga's apparently this way too.,1
1253,"i didn't realise this was a robinson crusoe rick stuck in the miniverse type of thing. it's cool but i don't like how they were conscious inside the stone , for 3700 years? is everyone like that? that's nuts.",2
1254,So some wack job think it would benefit the eath if all the human and birth persevered by stone for unknown time.,1
1255,"I love this anime. My thoughts were like humans have been ""cementing"" gaia mother earth and now, how does it feels like to be the one being ""cemented"".    Dystopia is <3",0
1256,Looks like some high school romance dropped.,2
1257,Can someone spoil me a bit as to where this is going?,1
1258,"I was like damn these kids have shonen MC level mental fortitude to be trapped 3,700 years and not have any mental problems from the isolation. At least none shown as of the first episode. Most likely there will be a character introduced that can't handle the change of lifestyle but I'm waiting for the character that is mentally broken cause of the experience.    Oh and Fire Force was great.",1
1259,  Sobs in Kars ,1
1260,Minecraft: The Anime,1
1261,I really enjoyed the first episode. Countdown until the community decides it's trash begins now I guess. For me I'm down for the long haul. It got me hooked good.,1
1262,holy shit the art style is gorgeous. its the most vibrant and full of colour show ive seen in ages. im not sure if it even is the colour the stands out but something about thr way that it looks is so incredible,2
1263,Based on that episode I think they might wake up that big strong kid first since they made an effort to say he was on TV and stuff,2
1264,"I remember like 3-4 months ago just seeing the trailer and going ""oh, that's look nice"" and reading 40 chapters in one sitting. The anime is really looking awesome, I hope it's well received, the manga really needs a push in popularity now.",0
1265,"Why didnt he just walk around, find a factory, and find a barrel of etching solution",1
1266,Because it's 3700 years in the future,1
1267,And barrels that can contain acid can't withstand natural erosion. There's a reason our world has a trash problem,2
1268,"     Is this supposed to be sarcastic? If yes, you have a terrible understanding of chemistry.",1
1269,"Went in knowing basically nothing about this series other than the stone thing, that's it's basically a game of Civilization, and that it's really popular.     I really dig the overall ethos of the story so far, that the ""impossible"" or ""unexplainable"" are just things we haven't figured out yet. Already a bit tired of Taiju's constant ""FUOOOOOOO"" and Senku is feeling a like a character that forcefully moves the plot along while having some stock quirks, but the foundation here is solid. If the characters get better then I'm really feeling this one.    Also that time lapse scene was super cool. It legitimately looked like sped up film. I've never seen this done in animation before.",1
1270,Not my cup of tea but i expect it will be very successful. the super-genius archetype isn't one my suspension of disbelief can bode well with.,0
1271,Primitive Technology the anime,2
1272,"Holy hell, I loved it! Totally a show up my ally.    Hopefully it eventually becomes a show that also tries to figure out why this happened and hopefully it was caused by someone or a company.    Also just a first initial reaction, I love Senkuu, and love how good at science he is. Curious if he will also get a counterpart heroine for himself as well. Maybe even a girl who is good at science.",2
1273,"I love the premise of the story, but is anyone else just completely turned off by how much of a smug, mean-spirited asshole Senku is? I don't know, I'm totally unsympathetic to his character. They could've made him a  little  more likable.",1
1274,It felt somewhat underwhelming?,1
1275,"I’m not an expert, but that can’t possibly be how you make grape wine, right?",1
1276,"Alcoholic beverages are nothing more than fermented juice. For mead you could let a mixture of honey, water and fruits ferment  i.e. ""rot"" , for wine you do it with grapes, vodka uses potatoes, etc. Some require distillation, others do not.",1
1277,Does the guy give an explaination on why it finally worked. Like was it the right concentration or the right temperature. After so much experimentation we didn’t really get the eureka moment of finally figuring out.    Or maybe I didn’t understand it. Can someone explain?,1
1278,"Enjoyed the first episode, looking forward to the next.",1
1279,I'm just going to jump straight into the source material. This is insanely entertaining so far!,0
1280,Good episode. I’m looking forward to the next episode.,1
1281,Welp episode one solved all the issues so I guess thats it then.,1
1282,yo the premise is really cool! senku and taiju have a great dynamic.,1
1283,I'm ten billion percent sure you're a big oaf,1
1284,"a 1 year time skip and a cure in the first episode, I hope this doesn't end up being a survival drama anime.",1
1285,AMAZING!,2
1286,"I love it,  a chemistry based anime.  I want to see more science",2
1287,"Why is no one talking about the ultra realistic grapes?      Good episode though, excited to see what comes next",1
1288,"This was the first ""fuck yeah science"" manga when it came out and the science angle really gave it a fresh feel.      I know people are gonna hate it for reasons, but I like shows that have a fun story but can be educational at the same time, and the educational part is story relevant.      Also the part with the acid lake blew my mind.",1
1289,"This reminds me of the documentary, ""Life after people"".",2
1290,which manga chapter do i read after the first episode ?,1
1291,It's the first episode... just check the first couple chapters. Like 2-3 at most usually.,2
1292,"i looked everywhere on the internet and i couldn't find anything cofirmed, just wanted to be sure. Thanks",1
1293,"Two bros, coming out of stone, 6 months apart cause their not gay.",1
1294,What day does this drop and does it drop weekly thank you,1
1295,Probably every Friday.,1
1296,"Of all the first episodes for anime I haven't read the source material that I've seen so far, this one was the strongest for me.",1
1297,I liked it but something feels off. I don't know if it's the fast pacing or editing. Got better later on once I adjusted tho.,0
1298,The main character looks like a green onion. lol!,1
1299,"Love the idea of restarting civilisation and trying to ""race"" back to the previous civilisation, haven't actually looked into any media that does it so I'll be watching this through and seeing how it does it.    Off the bat though, there are already some things I don't like much going on here. The MC just looks silly, like something from Yu-Gi-Oh!, but that's just looks really. Otherwise the two characters are alright. Secondly is the how ""realistic"" it is. It reminded me a lot of that Primitive Technology channel in how the MC knows and understands the historical methods used to develop certain technologies, but we don't really see too much of the technical thought processes behind it. It doesn't have to include them, but I thought it would have been interesting to see. Also how they maintain their hair or have some of the clothing they do is another thing. At least they look cool.    I like that it leaves some unanswered questions to explore later on. And apart from the obvious questions, how do they plan on have the world function in the future? They show things like rockets, but are they really planning on going that far with developing computers and rockets planes? How will they do it differently or is it just going to be a replica? The ending indicates it's going to have a lot of shonen elements which ngl, I'm not interested in from this premise.",1
1300,"I love the two main characters, the classic brain and brawn characters. Both know their limitations and work well together. But realistically, I doubt that their the only to non-petrified humans. The world is just so big that travel by foot will take a very long time.    Though, why was it only humans and birds  that we know of  that were petrified? In the montage it showed that at least dogs weren't affected, so there's likely other animals that weren't affected.",1
1301,Everyone hyping about show but  Poor doggy  probably died from starvation.,1
1302,Nope he freed him self and became wild it's even shown in the episode,2
1303,Yuzuriha waifu material,2
1304," Hm this wasnt what i expected. Not bad.            juice1       So the world turned to stone in an instant?      So people still think and stuff just turned to stone?  Hmm...      Wow this guy sure is dedicated to his love, good on him.      He woke up but everyone else didnt...      A stone bird?  So this started happening before the big wavbe?      Ah he met her trying to save the bird, it makes sense.      Wow shes still in 1 peice, the tree kept her safe.      Hey the DOc is awake too.  Hes been awake for 6 months.  Wow 3700 years... he counted them all... wow...      So they are gonna rebuild civialization.  Sounds like one hell of a leap but good luck.      Nitric Acid might be the cure huh?  Logical.      Making wine now?  Man this guy is a real MAcGuyver.      Wow a lot of time is passing huh?  All to make booze and thats only a starting point.      And he pulled it off, 1 year later.  Not bad.  Lets see where things go from here.",2
1305,"When they said that they needed booze, for science     ",1
1306,I'm wondering how or why they recieved those vertical black lines  through their eyes after reanimating. I know its a product of the petrification because they weren't on their faces pre stone age. SO CURIOUS. Great show though. I imagine we'll see the Primate High schooler mentioned soon as well.,1
1307,First cracks when de-petrifying,2
1308,Well that the light is what turned everyone to stone makes no sense for the world to have become what it is.  First of all there would of been a lot of humans working in bunkers where the light would not have been able to be reached who would of been researching the problem.     It appears the stone was more of a hibernation type affect and those not destroyed are still alive. I would of tried to crack open one of them pieces and see if you can crack it like a shell as that is how they woke up.,2
1309,"That was damn fun and I loved every minute of it! The beginning of losing everyone was depressing but then as the show went on, it showed how these two ""kids"" go on to recreate their destroyed world. This is going to be an awesome ride, having to remake civilization, save the people in stone, then find out what caused the phenomena. The team work and chemistry between the two guys is great. I can't wait to tune in every week to see how they progress next. I haven't seen this concept in any anime recently so it'll be a really fun watch for me.",0
1310,I cannot even sit in a room still counting for about 3600 secs... The dude counted for like billions of seconds...  Exaggerating to this extent is post human....,1
1311,   Civilization VII   ,2
1312,"so are we gonna talk about how Taiju came out from his rock shell 3700 years later still completely ripped, how have they not atrophied at all",2
1313,Good Show just hate Senko's hair,1
1314,"I wish I learned about this show two months from now so I could binge it. Then again, its harder to miss good shows when they debut",1
1315,Apparently most buildings won’t be around after 200 years...,1
1316,I'm a few weeks late but...      RUST: THE ANIME!,1
1317,Instant sell for me after watching the 1st episode. Will keep this anime,1
1318,Solid first episode!,1
1319,I can hardly wait for the next episode.,1
1320,Now they can create a huge harem,1
1321,"Great first episode, can't wait for more!    However, I think some cuts between scenes felt a bit odd...",2
1322,Yeah it's big brain time,1
1323,"Non action packed series, but it's a hype one.    Boy genius is fckin finally here!!!",1
1324,Really good anime to fill the void that all the finishing animes of the previous 2 weeks will leave.,2
1325,"Is it wrong that i am so what comparing Senku and Taiju to Sento and Banjo from Kamen Rider Build, cause they are so similar in terms of character and maybe relationship.",2
1326,"damn this already has a show, it feels like i just started the manga",2
1327,I am so happy right now.    The sound design was great! The colors! The timelapse! My heart!,2
1328,Anyone know why the girl tied her bow to the tree while waiting for the confession?,2
1329,The branch was broken. It was to keep the branch in one piece until it heals back  a few weeks perhaps ,1
1330,what are the streaming platforms for this,1
1331,Crunchyroll.,1
1332,Crunchyroll and Funimation,1
1333,I can't help but hear 'thank you' whenever he calls Senku,1
1334,Today seems like a fine day for SCIENCE!,1
1335,Good thing the anime is progressing nicely.,2
1336,Nobody:    Me waking up after 3700 years: OHAIYO SEKAI GOOD MORNING WORLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD,2
1337,That was pretty good. Our two main lads are both kinda annoying but the show looks pretty good and the premise seems interesting.,1
1338,This first episode exceeded all of my expectations,2
1339,I AM MAD SCIENTIST...  sonuvabitch ,1
1340,Will this be on vrv? I saw Crunchyroll is streaming it but I don't see it on vrv,1
1341,"If you have VRV, just connect your CR account to it and use CR. That's what I ended up doing until they fix their shit.",1
1342,Imagine counting for 3700 years,1
1343,"Adam and Eve, move aside. The ones who discovered the Stone Age were a bunch of high school students    The premise seems interesting. I like the dynamic interactions between Taijuu and Senkuu.    I’m not a big of Taijuu since he’s your typical, idiot shounen protagonist. Thank god Senkuu is here to make it 10 billion percent better!",1
1344,Boy looked so good with that beard.,1
1345,Are they going to explain how he keeps his hair styled?    You could render wax from fat to get the hold.  And dying the tips green shouldn't be hard with plants.  I'm not sure if he's a natural blonde or if he's bleaching it though.,1
1346,I'm going to make it up on the spot and say he uses tree sap and moss.,1
1347,The opening tho     Freaking hyped,1
1348,I liked it. I think this is going to be a show I seek out anime only first timer reactions thoughts liveblogs for.,1
1349,That was really fucking good actually damn,1
1350,"My discussion? It was fuckin great, I'm very hyped for this    That is all.",1
1351,Link to download it pls ;-;,2
1352,Surprisingly good. Out of the ones I'm watching it's the most surprising.    7 10,1
1353,I expected this to be meh or even bad from how they marketed and ok pleasantly surprised to say that the first ep makes it look really good and so far has set a good paced plot and cute world building can’t wait for more!,1
1354,"The fast-forwarding scene was awesome, can't say I remember seeing an anime do that before",2
1355,This seems like a parody of something. On God what the hell did I just watch?,1
1356,So glad this got adapted. Its the type of innovative story the anime industry desperately needs to balance out the creatively bankrupt drivel that is isekai.,1
1357,"Easily anime of the season, to be honest",0
1358,Little early to say that,1
1359,"So, this show is about two teenage dudes who kept themselves alive through sheer force of autism, and incel-tier desire for a girl the one dude had a crush on, and then immediately launches into a  even more  homoerotic version of primitive technology.     This could be the biggest comedy anime of this season.",1
1360,Animation and art style are two different things...     It would be hard for any studio to replicate an art style as polished and detailed as Boichi's. It still looks very good.,0
1361,"Sorry my bad, corrected it, idk why I wrote animation. It's still very inconsistent though. In some scenes it looks good and in a few others really bad. I wouldn't mind it if it was just ok, but consistent. The inconsistency is what bothers me.",1
1362,Really? I found it surprising how much of the arststyle they managed to bring over to the anime. Maybe I'm still desensitized from Berserk,1
1363,It was mainly the characters that looked off. The background art was great all the way through. Should've probably specified that I meant the characters and not the background art.,1

Never really liked the shonen artstyle all that much - e.g. this one, Kimetsu no Yaiba, even Attack on Titan. Rubs me the wrong way for some reason.    Don't care though. This opening was pretty lit, the humor in the ways the two boys woke up cracked me up  counting by ones vs the Power of Love , and I'm pretty interested to see where it's going. Will give it at least three episodes, most likely.    Next Episode: Time to Wake the Waifu!",1
