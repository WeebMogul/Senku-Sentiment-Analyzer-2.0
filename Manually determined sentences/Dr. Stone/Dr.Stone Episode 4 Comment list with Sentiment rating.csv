0,"senku's dad being dad of the year here, and in the latest manga update.. I swear made me tear up.     ;    I thought they gonna do 2chaps per episode again, but I'm half suprised they cut off at that moment.. I'm half expecting it though because it's a perfect one.     ;    child senku is cute.",1
1,"Aww, they didn't show kid Tsukasa in the hypothetical flashbacks. Still a fantastic episode, though. Within the framework of just this episode, it really paints Tsukasa as a respectable person that has a conflicting perspective.",1
2,I was waiting for it!! The 4 dolls instead of 1 will still be 1 of the most iconic scene in this series,1
3,kid tsukasa will most likely be shown at the start of the next episode following the recap,2
4," ""They did a good job foreshadowing Senku's ace in the hole with those cracking sounds. But was the healing factor of the petrification shown anywhere so far?"" ",1
5," ""Kinda, last episode Yuzu's foot was still petrified and she said afterwards 'it doesn't hurt anymore'. Also Taiju and Tsukasa were full of energy right after waking up and not tired, hungry or thirsty"" ",2
6," ""what sounds?"" ",2
7," ""Every time he cracks his neck there's a distinct cracking sound and that's an important foreshadowing."" ",2
8,Really enjoying the pacing. Hope they do the full Senku flashback next ep,1
9,"I feel kinda bad for the anime onlys, that was one hell of a cliffhanger to end on!",0
10,I had to hang on it in the manga.,2
11,"Well the flashbacks really do not work outside of the manga, but at least people got the introduction to the best dad in manga history. I only made it to chapter 54 before stopping but god damn I swear it's the best character in the story.",1
12,He just had a great chapter too.,1
13,"""You can accomplish anything through diligent use of science""    Proceeds to give his kid presents through Santa",1
14,"Bro science launching off the myth of Santa is an incredible narrative allegory for how this whole ""on the shoulders of giants"" thing is",1
15,I find this comment really interesting but I'm afraid I don't fully understand it. What do you mean  'this whole on the shoulders of giants?',2
16,"     It's a pretty famous quote from Isaac Newton  who did a lot of very important science stuff like inventing calculus, coming up with theories of gravity motion, some fun stuff showing 'white' light is actually made up of multiple different colors in combination, etc. , IIRC.    The full thing is ""if I have seen farther than others, it is only because I have stood on the shoulders of giants"", as a recognition that he wouldn't have accomplished any of the work he's justly famous for without others going before him to pave the way - folks like Pythagoras, Euclid, Galileo, Bacon, etc.     On a tangential note, Newton and many other scientists of his day and before were pretty heavy into mysticism and alchemy. Not really surprising, given that alchemy is a significant historical root of modern chemistry. ",1
17,Wow  < read this in kuzuriha's voice to understand how I feel rn  thanks a lot for the great explanation!,1
18,"It's exactly what Senku's done for everything but the unpetrification liquid  and even parts of that, actually : he's standing on the shoulders of all the scientists and engineers  and chemists, and metallurgists, and...  who went before him to bring us to the modern world, and simply executing on what they'd discovered or created that he can remember that's useful in his situation, like the gunpowder formula.    He's standing on the shoulders of giants, which is why he seems so metaphorically tall.",1
19,"     It's a saying that goes back at least to the 12th c., probably longer than that.",2
20,"I've always seen it attributed to Newton in lists of quotes and such, although I can well believe that he wasn't the first person to say it - just the most famous early modern user of it.",2
21,"Mysticism and science go along side by side in history. What made us wonder about the stars lead to us having a drive to set foot on the moon.    You may argue that the two are counter to each other, but when you take in to mind that both are necessary for a civilization to develop, you can see it for the bigger picture.    Edit: a word",1
22,"""Mysticism is about trying to explain and science is about doing it. But at the end of the day they both want to  know "".",1
23,"This is one of the themes in the Metroid Prime video game series, that those with advanced science appear to be gods to those less advanced, and with that power comes those who abuse it and create weapons to control civilization.",2
24,Oh fuck yeah those games were awesome. My favorite was prime 3’s reptilicus lore. Where a scientist combined magic and science to make a really powerful golem,1
25,That just reminded me of a  fairly personally favored  quote from The Talos Principle:     ;                       ,1
26,Curiosity is the common factor here.,2
27,moon landing was fake. They cant even enter space     ,2

35,"Well, his dads VA is the same for leorio so it’s obvious that he went to become a hunter",2
36,"Same, and I've already read the manga  well, past this at least, stopped at chapter 19 but yeah .",2
37,"If you are that light hearted, dont watch anime.",2
38,Ew get a load of this guy ,1
39,"Ah yes, because shedding tears means s he isn't enjoying it.",1
40,Downvote my above comment as much as you can,0
41,Little Senku was so cute on so many levels,1
42,Lmao at the escalation of his experiments.,1
43,"Fun fact:  they did a tiny bit of censorship by removing the exact %s of the materials.  I'm glad that this was the only thing they have changed, I was worried they have to heavily censor the experiments due to the fear of some idiotic kid replicating them. Based Nippon.    Edit: also bravo to every poster in the last episode's thread who correctly guessed saltpeter! 10 billion points to you!",1
44,"Yeah and it didn't interfere with the storytelling at all, which is a positive.",1
45,Nice. Almost all shows I think do this . Heard the same about breaking bad,1
46,"Yea, Cranston actually learned how to cook real Meth from DEA agents for the show to make it more realistic",1
47,haha why though? Did it make his acting better?,1
48,"The show was based around meth, knowing how to cook it would make the cooking scenes  and by extension the show itself  that much more realistic.",2
49,realistic to who though?? people who know how to cook meth? lol,1
50,"Educated parts of the audience and people who'd gain interest in the subject, watching something and finding out that's it based on science etc is pretty neato",1
51,"There were quite a few scenes were he would shout out stuff related to cooking. I'd imagine knowing the actual steps, chemicals, and processes would make it easier for him to ad lib lines in different takes to see what sounds best.",1
52,Yes? Have you WATCHED Breaking Bad sir? It's considered the best tv series ever for a reason.,1
53,why they used sugar when making explosive?,2
54,Glucose is basically just chemically stored energy,2
55,"For living beings,yes.Because we have enzymes.But what about makes it a good gunpowder component?",2
56,"The same actually applies to its use in explosives as the stored energy comes from breaking the bonds between each atom within the compound - which is achieved in this case by the violent thermal reaction of exploding gunpowder.    And while in humans the energy is siphoned off safely through a brilliantly complex system  phosphorylating glucose to then tear it apart through a gauntlet of reactions until there's nothing left but waste , the end result is the same: a sudden rise in the amount of CO2 + H2O present in the surrounding area.     In the case of gunpowder, since the energy released from glucose's decomposition hasn't been effectively transferred towards catalysing some reactions, it instead releases as a chaotic blast of heat and light   that outdoes that of gunpowder on its own  .    EDIT: Though sugar's purpose in the form of the monosaccharide   dextrose   is to act as a binder for the powder mix.  Credit to u War Hymn here for providing his knowledge. ",2
57,Science is cool!,1
58,Senku the science guy,2
59,"Most sugars have about half the thermal energy density of charcoal, so I doubt a sprinkle of fruit sugar is adding much energy to the combustion reaction of the gunpowder. The author likely confused it with the common use of dextrose  a simple sugar  in making black powder as a binder in minute amounts. It's sticky when wet, and helps the ingredients clump together better when mixing and granulating the powder. But you can't add too much, because it actually retards the burn rate.",2
60,"That actually makes a lot more sense than my explanation, since I was focused on the first part of zekoPs statement and ignored the obvious point that charcoal is used in barbecues. I'll edit my statement, thanks.",1
61,The same reason it makes for a  good rocket fuel ,2
62,That's a good question. It's not necessarily obvious that a food makes a bomb. But turns out sugar is very flammable.    I wish people didn't downvote comments just because they appear to be questioning the show.  That's what it looks like anyway. ,1
63,"      Sure about that, my dude? ",1
64,joules are joules,2
65,"So that it doesn't taste bad, DUH.",1
66,understandable,1
67,"For gunpowder or other pyrotechnic recipes, we sometime add dextrose  a type of sugar  to act as a binder or glue to make the ingredients stick together better. I'm guessing the author assume that any fruit sugar will do this as well.",2
68,"I'm not an expert chemist, but I know that sugar is really flammable for some reason. It probably makes it burn faster.",2
69,for extra oomph!,1
70,They switched out bleach and ammonia for unlabeled bottles in Madoka.,2
71,"This reminds me of Burn Notice where they usually added ""and a few other things"" to the end of the recipes for making explosives and stuff.     The thing is, most of the time they would actually give the real recipe  without  leaving anything out. It was basically to ensure that anyone stupid enough to try and copy them at home would mistakenly think: ""too bad they didn't tells me all the ingredients, since now I can't copy them"", even thought they  didn't  leave anything out.",2
72,"I wasn't a big fan of ""Mecha-Senku"", even as a joke cutaway it felt out of place. I would've prefered Senku just break the fourth wall",0
73,Yea it was weird but at least gave me a decent laugh.,1
74,"That's a good catch, I guess it's always better to be safe than sorry.    To be fair though, what's shown in the anime isn't detailed enough to be super useful, even with the quantities they censored out.    The show details the recipe like so:  Step 1  make charcoal  It can be assumed they crush this, though method not shown it'd be doable to a dumb kid looking to replicate it.    Step 2  Find sulfur from a volcano...  Alright, difficult, but perhaps doable...?    Step 3  Find a bat cave where mystery liquid drops down, and like you just gotta know it's saltpeter. Also these only exist in Asia, but since it's target audience is Japanese, I'll let that slip.    Ooookay...    Say you somehow manage to mix these things, you'll get a somewhat fast burning  Burning, not explosive, though even in the explosive form it's vastly inferior to modern explosives, and gunpowder for that matter, even the improvised explosive kind used in asymmetrical warfare.  mixture that leaves behind enough corrosive gunk behind to clog up any projectile weapon that will actually fire it.    And that's assuming the kid figures out the granulation bit and how to actually properly use the stuff to blow things up or fire a projectile.    It strikes me that anybody determined enough to figure all that stuff out would have googled it on their own, and despite a measure of security by obscurity, there's plenty of information swimming around on that.    I dunno, I find the obsession with ""Gunpowder changes the world!"" in this kind of stories a little optimistic, considering the stuff existed for half a millennium before it started becoming a powerhouse on the battlefield.",1
75,well because it took humans half a millenium to figure out that gunpowder is actually a really good weapon to kill and intimidate people.,2
76,"Nah, man. They put it in grenades and primitive, but inferior weapons nearly from the get go. see fire lances and perhaps the early hand cannon that replaced it  Though they weren't deadly enough to replace swords or bows.    Though your optimism is pleasing, humans are great at killing each other, and sadly, we've always liked to find new and creative ways of doing so.    You're partially right in the sense humans needed to invent the right weapon for gunpowder, though. But with next to no knowledge it's not as trivial as it might appear.    Also supply lines aren't trivial as gunpowder is bringing a whole slew of problems - but of course that only applies to storage in this case.",2
77,People still used swords and bows along side guns. But people stopped wearing armor afterwards. You had soldiers like musketeers that carried both sword and guns but wore civilian clothes into battle instead of shields and chest plates      ,2
78,"The development of modern combat fencing also made armor a hindrance.  But that first out fit you show might actually be Armor with rectangular blocks of iron steel in lines making a very effective late Armor type. I learned about it in museum were a somewhat decayed one showed both the full thick cloth outside look but the rows of iron making up the armor.   Also Full plate actually in part developed to stop bullets and they actually succeeded at it as fairly recently we realized the Armor was Composite with first two and then three layers of steel combined together. A Armor technique lost basically till after WWII in Tank Armor design.   But slowly guns got more and more powerful, Rifled weapons started being developed, modern fencing made wearing armor a hindrance if out of formation, and more modern ways of rasing a Army meant you could field huge numbers of troops with guns which took considerably less training time than Bows and Crossbows.     Still blows my mind though when I found out about the semi automatic Wheelock and Flntlock weapons the rich and a few speciality units used. Cocked by trigger guard like Old West carbine ball and powder would come out of internal magazines and some versions had a third magazine of powder for ignition in the pan auto placed. A rate of fire around one round a second possible. Gunky nature of Black Powder and the fact with no mass production each of the semi autos were a master work of a master gunsmith kept the semi auto musket rare as supper expensive and it took dedicated maintaince to keep one firing with no repair parts available local.   The types of Armor and weapons I just mentioned show a lot more technology and ideas how things could work than we often think the had.",2
79,"So the first picture you show is a matchlock musket 15th century and forth. firstly there's some inventing to do from gunpowder to a matchlock like the slow burning match, the metallurgy to contain the forces  Don't want it to blow up in your face     And secondly, matchlocks did have armor that could block them!  the name bulletproof is from actually proving that the armor stopped a matchlock     The latter seems to be a percussion cap - thats late game  19th century  stuff with a shock sensitive explosive primer for the gunpowder, although mounted externally on an expendable nipple, unlike internally like in modern cartridges. More inventing to do!    There's just a long way from gunpowder to a functional rifle, even an early kind and even with the infrastructure in place to actually make the iron in the first place.    Even dr. Stone's best bet would've been to make a wood cannon, or an 850's style grenade, not a rifle, since he's in a hurry and even the iron itself is really hard to make. No difference in that just because he's a wikipedia of science knowhow.    So i mean, if you actually get a percussion cap rifle, yea its devastating, but to get till that point? Not so easy. Also, if you can make refined steel and machinery to make precision rifles -- make smokeless powder instead! Its better and doesn't foul barrels or make a thick smoke cover after burning.",0
80,"     In Jules Verne's  The Mysterious Island , the main characters decided to just skip gunpowder and go straight for nitroglycerine, mercury fulminate, and guncotton, because that was going to be a much easier production process given the resources they had on hand.  And they needed the nitroglycerine for blasting rock to divert a river.     They did have the advantage that they started out on the island with modern  for the time  guns when they were marooned, and just needed guncotton for when their initial stock of gunpowder ran out.",2
81,"The earliest forms of gunpowder were useless for anything but slight sizzles, it took a long time for people to discover the right mixture to make it go boom, and even then its main warfare use is just scaring people by making big bangs.",2
82,"You can literally buy sulfur and potassium nitrate on Amazon, you don't need to go chip them off a cave wall as long as you know what to search for. The ratio of ingredients is also literally on wikipedia, so that doesn't involve much searching.    It's so easy that I'd go around and say censoring it is pointless, since it's so easy literally anyone can learn how to make it in less than a minute.",1
83,"Exactly, the information provided isn't that good. And the more hard to find processes, like making saltpeter on your own, something that would be useful for a kid looking to replicate the show, simply isn't shown there.",1
84,"     That's usually where sulfur was found and mined in the old days. In the case of Europe most of the sulfur came from volcanic areas in Sicily. Even today,  sulfur is still mined by hand from volcanoes in Indonesia . The gathered sulfur was relatively pure, and refining it was a simple matter of melting the sulfur and let it flow out to leave behind any mineral impurities.",2
85,"Fully agreed, it's the place to get it - though maybe not so much for a random kid looking to create gunpowder in the garage!     In fact, all three places of getting the components were historically used  and as you point out with sulfur, is still used , including the bat cave - i believe the british empire used the bat droppings, though the french could not and had to device a different way of making it.    I'd imagine a random kid would have to buy it directly or get it via a chemical reaction.    And thus my point was twofold - it's not super necessary to censor it  especially in light of the already partially missing details     And that even when made, it's not as powerful as people seem to think.",1
86,"     Bat guano is bat guano, all over the world, and the caves bats live in form a nearly perfect environment for the layers of it on the floor to naturally refine concentrate its high saltpeter content, allowing you to skip a lot of steps in refining the saltpeter out of it compared to  starting with raw cow dung or some such     I know we've got cave bats in both North and South America, and in many places, the guano deposits on the cave floors were extensively 'mined' for either use as fertilizer or as a gunpowder precursor, so I don't get the whole ""they only exist in Asia"" thing you're talking about.         Well, the reason it and other similar advances are usually believable enough for fiction is that most of the trick is knowing how it works in the first place, which often took a long process of trial and error over generations of incremental improvement  like figuring out gunpowder is far more explosive the finer you grind the ingredients .    In gunpowder's specific case, another reason it took so long to weaponize it effectively in gun form was the necessary advancements in metallurgy, smithing metalwork, and mass production to make stuff that you could safely shoot it out of. Go to a medieval metalworker and say ""I need a steel tube that can handle 6,000 PSI of internal pressure and light enough I can hold it in my hands - and I need three hundred of them"" and they'll look at you like you've lost your mind, even after you explain what you mean by PSI.",2
87,"Interesting, i stand corrected on the bat guano point. That being said in the anime it's a magical drippy thing, not excrement filtered with water and harvested for potassium nitrate.    Also, on the second point i agree, I've stated as much to someone else in this thread. That's a big part of the barrier in this obsession - making good metal is hard. Even with the infrastructure in place, as you've said.     I agree you can speed up the 500 years of progress, but frankly, just the process of making great steel itself is huuge in terms of applications and firepower.",1
88,"     There's actually a rogue theory out there that the high nitrate concentrations on cave floors  and that collect in the bat guano  are actually caused by water leaching nitrates from the surface into the caves. This would also explain why you can find potassium nitrate  saltpeter  crystals growing even in some caves without bats. Now, that theory isn't widely accepted, but it's argued.    I think the anime  and the manga  basically just took a massive shortcut through the steps Senku would need to have done to refine salpeter  and, from it, nitric acid for the resurrection liquid  from the guano on the cave floor by just giving him the nitrate-rich liquid from the get-go, which I guess I'm ok with: he could believably have made what he got from what you'd actually find in a cave, but we didn't have to watch him go through the whole refining process, which would have really slowed down the beginning.         To be fair, depending on when and where in history you ended up, you'd probably be able to have the largest impact on agriculture, since there are a number of simple, explainable improvements that are basically ""huh, we never thought about doing it that way here"". That  plus some labor-saving devices and ideas  frees up manpower for larger armies and produces the larger quantity of food to keep them going, and in half a generation or so, you could potentially have significantly increased a region's military strength without ever touching anything directly related to military matters themselves.    I mean, if anybody's willing to listen to the crazy time traveler.",2
89,Gun powder changed the battlefield almost the moment they were introduced. Once gunpowder was invented so were canons and guns. Easily took down castle walls and eliminated the warrior class such as samurais and knights.,2
90,"Gunpowder was invented in China in the 800s, and it took hundreds of years to actually put it into cannons and guns. Cannons came first by hundreds of years, it took even longer to invent firearms small enough for a single person that were also durable enough to not just explode every other time you fired one.",2
91,"It took a long, long time for cannons to become safe, too. Case in point,  the engineer  behind the artillery used by the Ottomans to take Constantinople in 1453 died during the siege because one of his cannons exploded.",2
92,"The problem with personnel firearms was that early ""serpentine"" gunpowder was too weak and develop too little pressure for use in small caliber weapons. It was only after they invented ""corned"" gunpowder  where the ingredients were mixed wet and compressed  that smaller weapons like pistols or muskets became effective weapons.",2
93,"The correct ratio of gunpowder materials is literally on Wikipedia though, it's not exactly a secret. Even removing that seems unnecessary.",2
94,Probably trying to avoid lawsuits.,2
95,That's actually a great move by the directors,1
96,"     I kinda expected mini-mecha-Senku to pop back up after the first batch blew up and go ""See? That's why you don't do this at home.""",2
97,i only guessed saltpeter because i watched drifters.,2
98,Is that really censorship? It's more so localization.,2
99,"It's not localization, the Japanese track doesn't feature the percentages either.",2
100,Nope,0
101,"In this time of Internet it so easy to look up stuff censoring things has little logic.   Back when I was young 60's 70's It was hard I'm sure for the average kid back then to even know how to start, but for a library rat like me even then looking up all the stuff you need to do stuff was not that hard.",1
102,If anybody really wants to use gunpowder it’s not hard to find the recipe online anyways,2
103,"""censorship"" of shit that anyone could look up online in seconds, and which hasn't been EVER used by terrorists and such because there are far easier ways of getting chemical explosives, the most popular being things like fertilizer.",2
104,Senku is no stranger to escalation.  Just today  he started a fire         tomato ,1
105,"They cut it out of the anime, but one of the first victims to succumb to ceasing thought after the stone wave  looks very familiar... ",1
106,PRESIDENT KARS!,2
107,"To be a bit more serious, ""All of America cried"" is a popular line to use in Japan when promoting a movie drama coming to theaters, to emphasize the film's quality. Although I also thought it made for a nice burn.",1
108,"Also loved how apparently no adults thought it was a good idea to get involved. Like these kids are making explosions, but yeah let's not supervise them.",1
109,"You wouldn't believe the shit we made in the 90s without adult intervention. Actually, now that I think of it, my friend and I made all of what was shown here; the thermite, the gunpowder, the rocket.  not the Tesla coil, that was way too dangerous, still have the schematics for it, though       I almost became a pyrotechnician thanks to all this early exposure.",1
110,I always think of the story Bernie told on the RT podcast about how he tried to make thermite by boiling gasoline on the stove whenever people mention crazy diy stuff.,1
111,Silly bernie! A thermite reaction is just a redox between a metal oxide and a base metal! You don't need gasoline for that!    Gasoline is what you need when you want to make Napalm: Just dissolve some styrofoam into hot gasoline!,1
112,"He was making napalm, he was using the Anarchist's Cookbook if I recall correctly.",2
113,That it! Sorry I thought thermite sounded strange but couldn’t think of anything else it’d be.,1
114,Yeah but Senku grew up in the 2000s,2
115,Early 2000's was still crazy bud. It's from the late '00 onwards that we got safe and shit,1
116,Something about seeing the flashbacks of all his past experiments having Taiju helping was giving me Phineas and Ferb memories for some reason,1
117,"I love these kind of antagonists. Merciful, but evil intentions.",1
118,Tsukasa really is a good boy at heart.,1
119,"Unfortunately of the type that causes great evil in name of idealism.   And totally ignorant of human behavior, the local street gangs, and history. The young are even more likely than the old to start up armed conflict as the human tribe instinct demands us humans do. The young are way more likely to get violent on a personal level. Only high brain taught behavior and maturity can tamp down the instinct unfortunately way to many never actually grow up.",0
120,kira type ideology though,2
121,"yeah, tosses women roughly to the ground for no fucking reason. What a great guy.",0
122,"When you are about to deal with the specific person that could fuck you up there is little point in thinking about chivarly, you know?     Even less when you are someone who believes in the survival of the fittest  and purest  and probably don't give a fuck about the gender of the other person.",2
123,It was completely unnecessary and makes his character come across as a complete douche.,0
124, ,2
125,"He is a guy murdering people because of his ideals, how it is bad to push someone? He is an asshole that given his role of ""power"" wants to decide who is worthy of life and who he isn't.     But he wasn't a bad person until he pushed a girl  which, again, outside of society our social rules are nothing? Do you think that 100k years ago a man wouldn't have hit a woman if he needed to?  because he looks cool and speaks like an idealistic hero?  Jesus Christ",0
126,       That was the comment I responded to. Jesus Christ.,0
127,"Yeah, but you still said that this made his character appear rude.   To which I object with MURDER..",0
128,You sound like you just feel like arguing at this point.,0
129,"I think so too. Before he was just a seemingly nice enough guy with distorted askew morals. Whereas holding the knife to her throat didn't actually hurt her, and you could argue he wouldn't have actually killed or maimed her and was just trying to manipulate Senku. He actually hurt her when he shoved her, which crosses a line.",2
130,I think you missed the bit where he  murdered multiple people. ,0
131,"That doesn't bother me at all, I agree with his ideals to an extent",1
132,So you think that murdering people is A-OK but pushing a girl to the side is a no go? The fuck kind of logic is that?,0
133,Reddit my guy...Some people here are just...Not worthy of trying to understand them and their thinking.,0
134,"yall are fucking stupid with this. We get it. He's a murderer. But the anime tried to portray him as a principled murderer. He has an ideology. We fucking get it. The point is that intentionally hurting a helpless girl for no reason at all ruins that character writing. The deal was done, science guy already agreed to his death. There was no reason to be that rough with her. It was stupid. He's just a shitlord after that. If you expect me to take your antagonist as some morally grey principled bad guy then don't have him abuse helpless women. And before the next comment is ""lol dummy he killed children statues lol"" No fucking shit, I know that. I didn't feel the need to list the reason's why he's not ""just a guy with a big heart"" which was the comment I was responding to. I just pointed out one single thing that makes him a piece of shit. shonen writing at its worst.",0
135,He's already a piece of shit since he revealed his ideals. His action towards Yuzuriha is not surprising.,0
136,"its almost like that's why I mocked the guy I was responding to for saying he was just a dude with a big heart. instead of seeing the simple point everyone had a meltdown that I pointed out the abuse of a girl instead of murder, as if the murder wasn't apparent as fuck.",0
137,"the best part was that in the whole exchange, tsukasa always had a sad expression, he didn't want to kill him, but needed to for his desired future.",1
138,"Hes a good guy, but also a murderer",0
139,"You have it wrong. Good intentions, but evil actions. He is a true believer of the ends justify the means.",1
140,"This actually makes him a lot more realistic as a villain - in reality, the greatest evils are often motivated by moral convictions, not due to a lack of them.  Scott Atran has a really good lecture discussing the psychological mechanisms behind it ",1
141,"""The best villains are the heroes of their own story.""",1
142,"And even then its not like he has truly bad intentions. He strives to make humanity safer and its not like he is 100% wrong. You bring more people back and eventually someone is gonna be out for only themselves and that will led to more and more until you have the american government. Cause think about it. If this actually happened, how many people would openly choose to depetrify trump?",0
143,more like good intentions achieved through evil means,0
144,They’re called  Well-intentioned extremists ,2
145," It's not so suprising to see a side character die, since the protagonist is a bar of soap after all.",0
146,"The fuck lmao? The protagonist isn't a bar of soap, that's the titular character of the series.    The protagonist is the forest. Lots of growth and always on screen.",0
147,     Eponymous character but that's not actually important.,0
148,"Yeah, titular characters tend to have a lot more jiggle physics.",1
149,"True, the forest sure got over 3000 years worth of growth in the first episode alone.",2
150,Him not wanting to tell her he loves her because she has nowhere to run if she rejects him is honestly beautiful and caring,1
151,Yeah like he's a dumb ass but he's caring and well meaning.  The fact he put actual thought into it and realized how unfair to her it would be shows a lot of emotional intelligence that makes up for his lack of science.,1
152,"I love to know that he has many facets. Some people think he's tropey, but when he show so many good traits and acting out of his stupid way when situation demands, that's when you know he's a great character.",1
153,"So uh, how difficult is it for Senku to invent reliable condoms? Because another reason I thought it might be a good idea to wait on starting a relationship is that if they start fucking and she gets pregnants the child is fucked being born in a world with no infrastructure  also she becomes a liability in the later more complicated stages of pregnanthood etc ",2
154,"Humans can have babies without modern infrastructure.  The biggest risks  I believe  to the mother and child respectively are infection and nutrition, both of which Senku should have a decent understanding of.    They can also de-petrify a pediatrician or two just in case.",2
155,"Don't forget birth complications. I'm sure Senku can make vulcanic glass scalpels, not sure about the other tools required for a c-section.",2
156,You do know we've survived for many years without such infrastructure. yes they will have their hardships but they can still survive and have kids. If she dies due to complications then she dies man. Life goes on.,1
157,"Humans as a species did. Humans  specifically, women  as individuals died a lot",2
158,"Of course I did, having children has its complications but that's the risk of that time.",2
159,Of course you did? You were there? :p,1
160,"So I may be totally wrong on this since I'm just going off my questionable memory, but not very. We've had condoms for a surprisingly long time. We used to make them out of animal intestines or something like that",2
161,I’m sorry but animal intestines sounds more like a sex aid then a safety precaution,2
162,We still do make condoms out of animal intestines for those with allergies. Unfortunately they don't stop STD well as they can go thought the membrane and a bit more likely to break.,0
163,I don't think yuzuriha and taiju would have to worry about that.,1
164,"animal intestines work great as a way to prevent pregnancy, less so if they're removed from the animal first.",2
165,It’s very considerate and caring but I don’t know about emotional intelligence when he can’t see that she’s madly in love with him too and would say yes in a heartbeat.,1
166,"Yeah, he's pretty much the heart to Senku's brain.",1
167,Yeah but if man-beast over there killed her then what?    Oof。,0
168,then it wouldn't really have mattered one way or the other,2
169,"Damn, didn't even see it that way and just thought of it as blue-balling. Stupid me.",0
170,"Same, I always thought it was dumb and unnecessarily « romantic » to put those long conditions but it’s super considerate put it that way. No one wants to deal with romance when you’re the only woman on Earth !",1
171,"""Time to get to work repopulating!""     Nervous glances     Yeah, maybe not.",1
172,"Well, I guess we know why he got so hyped when he saw the three smoke signals.",1
173,"Yeah, possibly 3 new women to breed with!",1
174,"Wouldn't be too bad if you're the only man on Earth. Though actually maybe it would be. They might get  annoyed at the fact that you can  only  impregnate like 4 or 5 women a day. Then they end up chaining you up and attaching a machine to your balls that pulls out semen as its made, and they make into doses just large enough to impregnate someone.",2
175,"It's both, at least they have a decent justification, but it's standard anime practice to invent some reason why the MC has to delay his confession indefinitely",1
176,Yeah but all of civilization? Setting up a village should be enough. Also what is one of them dies? It’s definitely caring but in the current world they live in putting it off for too long is a pretty fucking big gamble.,2
177,Also a floating death flag too.,0
178,bruh yuzu was not even in the opening thats a huge fucking flag for whats supposed to be a main character,1
179,"Yeah, but Senku is in the opening and he's already dead. It's all part of the fake-out.",2
180,hes not dead...what?,2
181,Where is Aug when you need him!,2
182,Probably will have to go into women having huge numbers of kids for awhile making females to valuable to risk in combat for the most part  many examples of great ancient female warriors but always a small part of the forces ,2
183,"on the one hand, this is exactly the scenario in which teenagers following their instincts to fuck like rabbits is justified and, in all honesty, encouraged.     On the other hand, good on him for realizing that if you're the only woman on the planet and you're asked out by one of only three men on the planet, he's putting some very weird pressure on you.     But back on that first hand she obviously knew what he was trying to say and certainly seems to feel the same way so just going ""nah I'm cool with it"" would probably save them both a lot of trouble. Maybe she just doesn't want to have to deal with an extremely awkward breakup in a few months. It's like dating a co-worker but like 100 times worse.",1
184,He could've used The Implication but he didn't. Good man.,1
185,"yea it's cute but IF THIS NISEKOIS and DRAGS THIS SHIT ON FOR 500 chapters, im actually gonna be done.",1
186,Their relationship isn't that important to the story.,2
187,"Then it would even make even more sense to just turn them into ""official"" couple and move on.",2
188,Can't have a confession this early. He broke the rules so hard in episode 1 it turned everyone to stone!,1
189,And very death flaggy.,0
190,"He wanted to tell her for 3700 years,he knows how everything can end in an instant and decides not to tell her now?God damn it dude ...ofc they want to keep ""confession"" for end of series pff",1
191,"Yep that sounded caring, but somehow, I feel like the actual reason is that the author did not want to advance this relationship further...",1
192,Why would she run if she rejects him lol,1
193,This gave me a newfound respect and love for him.,1
194,"Not really, they both still know and being rejected is only a big deal if he's a dick about it because he can't handle being rejected.     It's pointless drama for the sake of drama.",0
195,HE KNOWS  THE IMPLICATION  D:,1
196,"You misspelled ""childish and immature""",0
197,     Except if there's only three people left alive and you won't speak to one of them and the other one is busy who do you go outside and speak to?,2
198,what,2
199,"Apart from there being four people, where did you get the idea that he wouldn't speak to her?",2
200,"Let's play the opposite game, why it's childish and immature?        By definition childish and immature are things connected with putting your own needs and desires above those of the others, or better, a mature person understands when it's the moment to do something not 100% about them.     It's kids who think about themselves most of the time ""I want that toy so I push my little brother and take it"" and when they start showing generosity and understanding of others is usually taken as a sign of them growning up.         In this situation Taiju shows great emotional intelligence in understand that the situation is heavily different from the one it was back in the past.    Now, they are more or less the only humans around and even if he isn't sure if she likes him back they are still friends, and he understands that in such a context it's possible that even if she wasn't interested in a romantic relationship she could say yes because... well, because fuck it, there aren't many other people around, she would have nowhere to go or ways to deal with the embarassment and sadness in dealing with a friend having a crush on you.",0
201,"You make it sound like propositioning a woman is rape light. Hiding your feelings isn't great emotional intelligence. People with strong emotional intelligence are good communicators, and communication is the key to building strong relationships.    Further, the anime made it glaringly obvious she would accept his proposition, so not telling her his feelings because he was worried she would turn him down is definitively NOT great emotional intelligence ... it's actually very poor emotional intelligence.    But of course I wouldn't expect  r anime to have normal feelings about relationships. Talking to a woman apparently is some major undertaking around here.",0
202,"He talks to her plenty, hes just not putting the pressure of being told he has feelings for her on her because her surroundings have changed drastically.",1
203,"Hot-take, what we see is different from what a young boy from high school sees? I know it's wild, but consider it.     From my PoV, he doesn't recognize her OBVIOUS signals, but is smart enough to not speak about such an issue with her in that situation.   What would happen if she refuses him? What if she said yes because she couldn't answer him no after being saved by him, but not having true feelings?   They are literally surviving on the edge of extiction, it's not a bad thought to nor burden her.    The issue isn't ""talking to a woman"" and definitely implying that the person you are speaking with you is a greasy nerd with no experience in the issue  I am an happy father of a child at the age of 29, I guess I know a thing or two  isn't, the issue is having different perspective upon an issue.   He isn't ""hiding"" his feelings, he decided to simply delay the problem to a situation more suitable than ""we are followed by a guy who could desire to murder us in a world full of predators and dangers"" to speak of romance and love.",2
204,The alternative is literally pulling a Dennis Reynolds.,2
205,I'd love a good reason as to why Senku would survive that cause Tsukasa would definitely kill in one blow.    I highly doubt Tsukasa would falter at the last second.,1
206,Its possible he put something in his collar to somewhat soften the blow.  Senku did say kill him in one shot so he could of manipulated him into attacking the back of his neck.    The problem then is how Tsukasa wouldn't feel the object,0
207,going out on a limb here and say he made something out of bronze to protect his neck.,2
208,"Senku is now Dr. Bronze. Next week, Dr. Iron.",2
209, Senku next week be like ,2
210,Senku built this IN A CAVE!,2
211,With a box of nitric acid,2
212,Well I’m sorry but I’m not senku,2
213,Still can't believe that character appeared again!,1
214,The adventures of Dr. Iron and Caveman,2
215,"or if you dont want to call him by all his alisases, maybe just shorten it to dr. plot armor.",2
216,Dr. Next-Material-For-Civilisation-Advancement,2
217,"""I am Iron Man""",2
218,Senku listens to Wu Tang confirmed.,2
219,"missed it, how come?",2
220,Because you gotta Protect Ya Neck,2
221,Is a thin strip of bronze strong enough to stop an amount of force that kills a lion in one blow...?,2
222,"You don't need to put 100% of your strength into something like that. He said it would be painless, not that he would obliterate his neck.",2
223,"So he want to become disabled? Lmao, even if he put anything in the neck, such a strong blow should make him broken anyway.",1
224,you're partially correct. I don't want to say exactly because I'm afraid it will count as a spoiler.,1
225,"He did rub his neck, he could've easily put something there when he did that. Also, I doubt Tsukasa ever killed anyone like that before, so he might not realise something felt off.",2
226,"Sure, he's seemingly some type of fighter though as we see him with what looks like standard fighting sports clothing.     Not that you can attack the back of a neck in fighting sports but he probably knows what it feels sounds like to break a bone.     Edit: I forgot he used a weapon and didn't just karate chop his neck",2
227,"And that's important. It wasn't a bonecrushing blow, it was an attempt to sever a nerve. That won't cut through a small bronze plate  probably  so I think that's our out for the episode. Good call,  u mistafour.",1
228,We are talking about Tsukasa. This Guy fears Senku because he is the most  dangerous person to destroy  his utopia .So he will make sure whether Senku is dead .I guess that after he has checked his pulse he will leave that place,2
229,Well Tsukasa did say Senku should go unconscious then die. Maybe Tsukasa will check if he's concious and if Senku could fake not being concious actually ending up unconcious but not dead maybe he will leave him. Especially if Taiju interrupts I doubt Tsukasa would want to kill anymore non adults,2
230,I was actually thinking exactly this. But also what if Tsukasa would have killed him in some other way tho :  I really want to see the next part as soon as possible          ,2
231,The old fake neck trick,2
232,Could have ,2
233,"If I had to guess, it might have something to do with their 'new' body structures. Senku pointed out the cracks on their faces and them still being alive despite that. Maybe their bodies are no longer just skin and bones and have developed into something else over the last 3700 years? Something that gives them plot armor and pseudo immortality!",2
234,"That feels like taking it too far, but u never know. Whatever might be the reason he survives, I just hope it's related to some science stuff and not just some new character saving them",1
235,"Its probably not too far fetched though.    Human beings even at their absolute peak cannot kill a lion in a single blow with their fists unless this man literally got a Magic punch in using 100% of his strength  even past body limiters  Their bones, muscle and body weight would make a feat like that impossible.     The stone process probably made their bodies more durable then normal and its quite possible they are also significantly stronger as a result.     Tsukasa is obviously a fighter of some sort so powerful feats aren't foreign to him, but having the strength to one punch a Full grown mountain lion is something I imagine is well beyond standard human capability.",2
236,I can somewhat get behind this reason now,1
237,"But then Tsukasa blows would also be stronger than 3,700 years ago",2
238,The only thing I can think of is that one of those new people distract Tsukasa somehow,2
239,"Nope, that’s the end of the series. Sorry   s",2
240,"He'll just transfer his consciousness into his body, no worries.",1
241,The  through the P A T H S taiju is gonna turn into a Titan and nom on tsukasa,2
242,his neck cracking,2
243,"Hey, so does mine! Can I finally be an anime protagonist?",1
244,You're not? Weak effort bro.,0
245, You thought it was soap but Dr. Stone was the dirt we washed along the way          dancewithit ,2
246,"It did look like he got hit, I feel like the new character shot an arrow at shishio and hit his blade and made the sound    And this startled them so their bodies were in an awkward position in the end scene    I feel like senko made hit bet that if there is others out there then they can defend themselves somehow    The only thing is shishio already caught an arrow out of the air before so I don't know how this new character interfering will get him to back off    This is all my speculation, maybe I missed stuff, but to me feels like the way it would develop",2
247,"he's already clones himself, this is just a backup that tsukasa killed",2
248,"If I had to guess the other humans that are there walked towards the ""smoke signal"" and attacked Tsukasa just in time?",2
249,"I thought that too, but unfortunately the blow is already dealt.",2
250,I have a feeling it’s to do with one of the people who sent a smoke signal...,2
251,Nobody wants to be told what happens.,1
252,He's just offering geez. No need to downvote a guy trying to be nice.,0
253,You're expecting this sub to do anything logical. Senku would hate this place,0
254,"Tsukasa:  note to self, do not revive any otakus either ",2
255,"If you had to give a level of certainty, what would that be?",2

Other than about the weird aspects of their situation  like petrification , he's doing very little original research, and just building stuff using concepts other people discovered and have been proven to work already.    It's all cool, and a leap forward for where civilization was reset too, but so far it's nothing  new , and I don't think it ever will be.",1

296,"I agree. When she was kidnapped I was a bit annoyed that she was just a damsel in distress, but then they gave her agency and she shot up to my favourite character now.    It was really great development imo",1

321,"Her design wasn't bad at first, but I'm a sucker for short haired girls.",2
322,They made a wall so that they couldnt see eachother naked. That's adorable.,2

330,"""football fields"" is no longer a valid unit for measuring the distance between her eyes",2
331,and her eyes don't look like a bug's.,1
332,i think she just sometimes looks better. like the animators are too done to try to copy boichi's style if it's not a closeup shot so they just give her a normal face,1
333,her eyes are closer together and they did away with most of the weird fuck lips,0
334,"A Bigger mouth and eyes that are simply colored. In the manga, she  and all girls  look like insects walking on 2 legs. their eyes feel full and their mouths are extremely small you can't see them.",2
335,They definitely watered down her design. Boichi's original looks like a different fucking species than Senku and Taiju. It makes her less unique but on the other hand you don't get that moments where it takes you out of it how different from the males she looks.,1
336,I loved her look in the manga and think she looks weird in the anime tbh,1
337,The moment Tsukasa really became a villain is when he cut her hair.,2
338, Meanwhile Senku was excited from seeing naked sulphur.  That's adorable too.,1

362,"You know normally I really hate the anime trope of will they won't they non-confessions for characters who are obviously into each other, but this is the first one I've seen in any show that actually makes a great deal of sense.    There are all sorts of reasons why propositioning the only  as far as they knew at the time  woman left on the planet would be sketchy. Particularly when the person doing the propositioning is pretty much the only thing standing between life and death out in the wilderness.",1
363,Exactly.  It's all about the implication.,2
364,Are you going to hurt Yuzuriha?,2
365,"No, no, she's not in any danger. But she'll say yes,  because of the implication .",1
366,Please don't take Yuzuriha on a boat.,2
367,The boat is a metaphor for this stone world.,2
368,I swear to god this  keeps popping up in all sorts of threads and it always catches me by surprise,1
369,"Yeah, any sort of confession from Taiju would be kinda inherently coercive at this point.    I don’t see why he has to wait until humanity is completely saved, though. I feel like he could just wait until they’ve reached the point of a small village and it would be fine.",1
370,"Because he is stupid, that's why.     Emotionally intelligent, yes. Smart, definitely no.        Probably from his PoV he needs to give her the same stage of the previous situation to have a ""fair"" ground.",2
371,"Taiju is A+ example of how to take into account power dynamics into sexual and romantic interactions. For the same reasons a boss asking an employee out is most of the time sketchy  she is under the pressure of the boss deciding to fire her if she declines --except here it's 10,000,000% worse because she literally has nowhere else to go.",1
372,"To add to this, there is no ""Will the won't they"" here. In this case, She knows what he wanted to say and was about to say those times, and even though Taiju is an Oaf, he knows that she understood what he means, it's just the matter of formalizing it, and he wants it to be fair for her.",1

374,Is there anything more beautiful than consent. Ah. ,1
375,I agree they handled it decently but it's still a shitty trope that needs to die.,0
376,"Tbf having to carry a child for 9 months, and have it be born without modern medical commodities would slow them down. Humans aren't at the top anymore, it'd probably be a death sentence having a child with a population that can't even be labeled as a village. No point when there are adults all around them who can get revived in 10 seconds by mustard.",2
377,Having a baby isn’t a death sentence. There are still many tribes with tech millennia out of date that manage it. It’s much more risky but it’s far from a death sentence.,2
378,"I get what you're saying, but a tribe is completely different from 3 teens nurturing a baby.",2
379,Yep no children till they have enough stability to start protecting children. Does not need a village though as nomadic tribes don't have them.,2
380,"I'm not necessarily saying they need a village. Theres only 3 people protecting one child and the only person capable of doing it reliably is that guy who's name I forgot that loves that girl who's name I also forgot. If something ever happens to him, that baby is left with a woman still weak after giving birth and a genius dude that only has science to protect him. Not saying its impossible, but odds are they're dead.",2
381,"I think that's an even better reason to proposition someone. If the future of your species literally depends on you, you have an obligation to proposition the only woman left alive.",1
382,"It’s not like everyone else is dead. They really don’t need to jump to making babies when they’re surrounded by statues of people that they know how to revive.    Plus, taking care of an infant would really slow them down.",2

384,"The tension was hitting me in the face the moment Senku and Tsukasa started talking, even more so than when i read the manga, a good soundtrack can really make a difference.

416,i have thats why i mentioned it,2
417,"If we go by what we have gotten from the past episodes, it could be a thing with the cracks that make them tougher on these parts. Like when Taiju survived the hit from the lion killing Tsukasa.     Or perhaps another option would be from last? episode, when we saw that Yuzuriha still had a patch of petrified skin that didn't fully dissolve. He could have some stone there, but that would be kinda odd and a bit far-fetched that miraculously a vital point was still covered in stone. Considering that we just learned that the process of reviving is a chain reaction that travels through the whole body and he revived himself, so he couldn't choose to cover some areas or something like this.    Also Tsukasa would immediately feel and see it when he tries to kill him and attack another vital point. Further, it shouldn't shield from much force considering he casually crushed tons of petrified humans with his bare hands.",2
418,Maybe he can harden like a titan lmao,1
419,"theres an inconsistent or we are not sure how it works but when  Tsukasa kills the stone people they are all stone meaning the stone didn't just cover them , they actually turned into stone , so senku most likely has what ever the stone was inside of him where his neck is",2
420,Damn,1
421,"I crack my neck pretty often and I don't have anything special there, maybe just a little habit Senku has.",2
422,he didnt crack his neck before he turned to stone,2

490,"This reason is about as non bullsht as it gets, at least for Taiju.     Were he to proposition her, in their situation there’d absolutely be some element of coercion simply because of the situation, even though he’s the nicest guy. It’s like how bosses can’t ask people out, because the employee faces the dilemma of saying no, or not risking their career.    He’s currently the only thing keeping her alive, and while everybody knows that he wouldn’t, the possibility that he could just leave her behind isn’t fair. It wouldn’t be right. Higher up in this thread there are some far better explanations but it’s honestly a super sweet moment.    Why she didn’t immediately hop over the fence and go “yea I’ll clean your pole right now no need” is another story tho lol, probably to respect his feelings imo",1

I wanna be mad but what Taiju did was perfectly in character, would've been nice though if he wasn't being a big dense oaf during that moment.    I really like Tsukasa as an antagonist. It's not like he wanted to kill Senku out of hatred or anger. He knows he has to even though  he clearly doesn't want to  It's actually pretty sad that it has come to this.    Anyway, I doubt Senku is dead. Tsukasa probably had a last minute change of heart. Probably. That cliffhanger is killing me though, I kinda wanna take a peek at the manga now so I don't have to wait a week to see what happens next.",1
509,     A couple more years  and episodes  is nothing compared to 3700 years of waiting. She can wait more…,1
510,"speaking of waiting, that got me thinking...    Senku and Taiju are amazing for keeping their consciousness the whole time they're petrified. But what about those who don't? Like, it won't be out of character for Tsukasa to also keep his, but normal people like Yuzuriha probably didn't. And yet, when they are eventually revived, their minds are still working like normal. So does it even make any difference whether you let yourself lose consciousness or not? It's not like Taiju broke out of the shell from will anyways.  Senku implied it's because he drifted to that cave with nitric acid . Was there any point to keeping one's consciousness alive the whole time?",2
511,"Maybe it's a bit of the theme of mysticism? Like scientifically all that happened was the chemical reaction but maybe the idea is that their will ""attracted the miracle"".    The remaining sign of early civilization is the Buddha which seems to be a very deliberate decision that it's something connected to religion, and even in this chapter it was ""Santa"" that gave Senku his lab. Put all of these together when they contrast so much with the cold science and maybe there's a bit of a theme of how myths and the mystics inspire science  the unknown inspiring the drive to discover .",2
512,That's a pretty good observation.,1
513,"Aside from maintaining situational awareness and crafting a plan for once you're un-petrified, probably not.    I think it's basically the difference between someone who's stayed awake all night and someone who slept. The person who was awake knows what happened that night while the sleeper doesn't.",2
514,look iam realy holding out here iam about to burts and go read the manga so stoop asking High IQ questions i realy want to hold on to the anime,1
515,"I think it has to do with maybe needing less materials? As we know, there's a lot of ingredients to making the revival formula, but there's no way all of those were what freed Senku and Taiju. It's likely that their will and nitric acid was enough to trigger some sort of compound to let them free themselves without all the extra stuff.",2
516,"     Oh, you'll find out, I'm about to summon it!     ""Taiju and Senku woke up just using nitric acid. But it didn't work on anybody else. They had to add alcohol to jumpstart the reaction for others. Why? Because brain activity provided the energy for the reaction. People who have consciousness only need nitric acid, but the rest need nital to wake up."" ",2
517,You shall have your answer in the next episode or the one after that.,2
518,"I don't think Taiju was being dense here, I see it more as him being fair to her. When she's the only girl in this world, with no where to run, what are her choices if she doesn't want to? in this world where her survival is ultimately dependant on Taiju and Senku.    Taiju wants to set a stage where she is free to reject, so when she accepts it's better.",1
519,They revived her so fast we have to wait for an announcement of romance in the very very end,2
520,Yuzuriya : Three words. Say those words and I’m yours.     Taiju : A smart phone ?,2
521,I think he is right to not tell her,1
522,     If she's bothered by it she can always tell him herself...,1
523,What is his ideal world? I really should rewatch the episodes again but at first I was confused on why he started killing the statues.,2
524,     How? His worldview doesn't even make sense. He wants to only revive the good people yet he destroyed every statue he has seen. There is no way he knows that they deserved it or that they wouldn't be a good person. He's just another hypocritical villain who doesn't follow his own rules and is a bad guy just to be a bad guy.,0
525,Wait what? He never said anything about just reviving good people. He said he only wanted to revive the younger ones and he wants the older generation to die off. I don't know if you've noticed but Tsukasa has only been destroying adult statues and has been leaving the kids and the ones around their age alone.    Tsukasa's belief is that it's the adults that cause pain and destruction and this new would should be left to the younger generation so it can prosper. It's a terrible world view but it makes sense if you've been paying attention.,1
526,I think Tsukasa's worldview is that all the adults are tainting the world and not allowing for true freedom. He wants to do away with laws and modern society to create his own utopia where the strongest prosper. That's why he only destroys adult statues as he perceives them as only being able to exist in the modern society. He doesn't care if the adults he kills are good or bad. To him they're all bad. They would only regress back to following laws of their time and not of the stone age.     TL;DR - Tsukasa basically wants a spartan society consisting only of young people that would grow up into the stone age instead of having to deal with the stone age.,2
527,"in his mind adult = bad corrupt. that's how he ""knows""",2
528,     SO THIS....IS THE POWER...OF   SPEEDWATCHING  ...NOT BAD...,2
529,"There would be a huge problem reviving humanity if yuzuriha got pregnant, so that's probably why they're holding off tbh.",1
530,"Anime only watcher here. Now I regret watching it immediately as it went up, because now I have to wait the full week for the payoff on that cliffhanger instead of like 3 or 4 days.

531,I solved that by binging the entire 117ish chapters in 2 days after the first episode.,1
532,The old man getting increasingly concerned about young Senku's experiments over time was hilarious,1
533,This episode is great. Well obviously Senku won't die as he is the main character but I wonder how he'll survive.     His flashback is also really nice. Creating a miniature rocket to outer space at that age is really impressive !,1

Instead we'll either have a Deus ex Machina  doubt it  or Senkou has figured out beforehand the method Tsukasa will use to kill him and has taken preventive measures  seems sketchy , OR Tsukasa reconsiders at the last moment, but the only new piece of information is that there other people who have awakened, I don't see how that could factor in to keep Senkou alive.",1
547,"yep, senku induced tsukasa to kill him that way",2

556,"If they actually addressed it, the interactions by themselves should demonstrate to Tsukasa that the real problem has to do with humans being humans, rather than other singular aspects. One of the first things that happen is a fight between humans, the major conflict thus far is between humans, not even the rest of the world. If someone wanted to ""fix"" the problem they would have to kill all the humans but then again, you can't really make it a better place for humans if you do that. It should have been made clear that there is simply no solution to such problems unless you completely remodel humans into being something entirely different.    Honestly if Tsukasa truly wanted to change things while being controversial, then might as well side with Senku and focus on genetic engineering so they can create a world with a new type of humans. That would make more sense and would be way more feasible in the long term.     ;    It's also nice to see a father that encourages his son to reach his dream.",1

562,"I was really confused by this episode. The fourth use of the calcium carbonate was making gunpowder by using potassium nitrate? I am not a chemist, but I don't understand how you could possibly get potassium nitrate by combining calcium carbonate with nitric acid.",2
563,"What i think happend is... that the mangaka just made a mistake.     I'm also not a chemist or anything, but i tried reading all kinds of wikipedia etc.  today because of this and i couldn't find anything.  I think he mixed up calcium carbonatel lime  from   shells   with   wood ash  . Wood ash has a large percent of calcium carbonate, but also potassium nitrate and small amounts of other salts , which is also called   potash   that can be washed out of it, leaving the lime behind      This also makes more sense with some of the other 3 uses:    1. Potash was one of the first ways to make soap. But this kind of soap would be more liquid.      In another reddit thread  u War Hymn answered how using seaweed for sodium carbonate together with the original calcium carbonate would make for a stronger lye which might results in a harder soap, a ""Dr. Stone""     2. Fertilizer: Wood ash is also a good better fertilizer, if the plants need both extra nitrates and the basic soil from the lime.    3. Mortar: I think this is where the mistake first came from, since burning shells gives a more pure lime which results in a good mortar, while the one from washed ash-lime can bleed out the remaining salt over time.      If we still want to fill this plothole with only the given informationen:  - There were actualy only 3 uses, the 4th one Senku was thinking of at the beginning was not useful possible in their current situation so he played down his mistake. Lime can be used for a shit ton of things in chemistry he might have been thinking of first.    - There were 4 uses, but he withheld the 4th to trick Tsukasa. Either into thinking lime is used for gunpowder, just in case Tsukasa wants to copy Senku. Or if Tsukasa knows how to make gunpowder into misdirecting him that Senku is not making gunpoweder, since lime would be useless.    A real 4th use helpful for them for lime would be the removal of hair from animal skin, to prepare for tanning, by soaking them in limewater.      Oh yeah, or it just might be censorship, so nobody just learns how to make bombs from a manga anime.",2
564,"He could have made nitric acid from soaking the bat guano in water which will form potassium nitrate crystals, but that doesn't have anything to do with calcium carbonate.     If he combined Nitric acid and Calcium carbonate he'd get calcium nitrate, which then could be combined with Potassium Chloride to get Potassium Nitrate, I think. I mean he could have gotten Potassium Chloride from sea water salts, but who knows.    also not a chemist.",2
565,"     That won't make nitric acid, just a solution of dissolved nitrates. To make nitric acid, the guano has to be heated  preferably with a sulphate mineral to act as a catalyst  to form nitrogen dioxide gas, which can then be bubbled through water to form a weak nitric solution. The nitric acid can be concentrated through distillation.           Potassium chloride is too stable to react with calcium nitrate. Potassium carbonate from potash or wood ash will be a better option.     potassium carbonate  soluble  + calcium nitrate  soluble  = potassium nitrate  soluble  + calcium carbonate  insoluble, precipitates out of solution     Alternatively, he could had just mixed wood ash with nitric acid to form potassium nitrate directly, or refine the potassium nitrate that already exists in the bat guano through recrystallization.",2
566,maybe they did it coz they want to avoid viewers doing it themselves?,2
567,"Wait.. There's no way he just died, right?",2
568,"Senku isn’t Dr. Stone though, they said that “Dr. Stone” was soap so they wouldn’t get sick and die.",2
569,"That's right. Our main character isn't Senku, it's Soap. Anyone can die, except Soap.",2
570,"Can someone explain to me fully why he chose to light the""double edged fire smoke signal?  Why didn't they just turn it off and go to the smoke signal the person in the forest was letting off?  If there is a spoiler involved they will say more about it later than no reply please. Just a little confused at his thinking if he knew there was a great chance Tsu was gonna show.",2
571,"From perspective, the smoke signal is actually from far away in the woods, and there is no guarantee that the person lighting the signal will stay there until senku and friends arrive to them. Senku also mentioned that the smoke they made may be mistreated as a volcanic activity and the other party will just leave, and hence they light a smoke and makes signal to them to signify it's an intended fire signal.    Last point, even senku is not sure about the chances of Tsukasa being around, otherwise they won't light the fire.",2
572,"Yeah I re-watched it but still didn't understand, I understand much better now. Thank you.",1
573,"He didn't wanted to let the chance of a 'first contact' slip by, someone else is out there and he chose to signal them ""hey, we are humans!"" and establish communication over hiding in case Tsukasa was around.",2
574," This episode was so beautiful that she managed to bring tears to my eyes in two scenes:    1.  The short scene where Senku's father sold his car to get his son at Christmas the necessary funds for his scientific curiosity   2. And at the end, where Tsukasa admits to Senku that they may have been friends in the world before the Petrification, and that Tsukasa finally found his first friend there.    Clearly a 10 10 episode. Pretty hyped, that the first volume releases next week in my country     ",1
575,"Reasons why this episode is the best one so far:    1. Low key sexual innuendo between Yuzuriha and Taiju at the beginning of the episode.  2. Why it took him so long to just say ""I like you"" to Yuzuriha is beyond my comprehension. Frustrating and entertaining at once.   3. How the heck this Tsukasa guy knows KNO3 and cervical nerve?   4. Senku's passion for science is inspiring.   5. Yuzuriha being Yuzuriha after Tsukasa cuts her hair.   6. That moment when you thought that guy was being sketchy about the key but realized that he sold his car for Senku's dreams.  7. Seriously, did I just heard a cracked neck?   8. Is it just me or Tsukasa's getting on my nerves lately? This guy is delusional.  9. Trying hard not to read the manga is hard.  10. Watching an anime like this in HD is such a blessing.",1
576,"       It was already stated that he is a highscholer, so I assume Tsukasa didn't slack off in his studies, even though he had his job to do, so that's probably how he knows about KNO3, a relatively popular molecule.      It seemed that he is a boxer, so that's probably how he came to know of whatever nerve.",2
577,"Oh, thank you! I forgot about that. An OP villain, indeed.",1
578,More villains would probably be OP if they didn't slack off in school.,2
579,Like this villain? ,2
580,And reasons to anyone who didn't watched this show to do it right now.,1
581,"Tsukasa is a particular kind of character, similar to Hermit from History's Strongest Disciple.",1
582,"For Point 2,    I think it was because of the implication that they are the only humans at that point and regardless of which answer she wants to give, there is a huge pressure on her to say yes.     Taiju probably feels that it is unfair on her to give her this much pressure and probably wants to wait till the pressure lessen on her before popping the question. So that she is less pressured that she has to say yes since well, at the current point when he was asking the question, they were the only known humans on this world and she is the only female, as well as at the moment, they can revive another female for the repopulation.",1
583,"why are people surprised that this show is unrealistic , i don't remember it ever trying to be realistic in the first place",1
584,"Damn this episode had me nervous actually, plus that cliffhanger ending!!! UGH!    OMG, in that beginning scene when they are in the water, Yuzuriha had her earphones off finally lol. I honestly was curious if they somehow became stuck to her after 3,700 years.    Of course, Taiju is going to wait to confess. So I guess that means we won't see it happen until the end of the series.    Low key, when Senkuu decides to reveal the mystery water to save Yuzuriha, my ship almost changed to Senkuu and her! That was cute how he saved her.    I am still kind of disappointed in the the OP and ED of this series. They are both lacking in my opinion, and could have been bangers.    Dude, kid Senkuu kind of looks like Gon Freecss.    Lastly, omg that Blonde girl is up and alive! She is one of the people from the OP that I am most interested in seeing.    Makes me wonder, is there other ways besides the miracle water to wake up? How did Senkuu wake up?",1
585,Agreed with the OP but the ED is catchy af,1
586,"Yeah, ED song isn’t that bad, average to me. I think the visuals of the ED are the main bad part.    Don’t really care for the images of real life things and the overall quality of the ED is “meh”. Like they kind of just threw it all together last moment.",0

588,So many stills. It's impressive how this anime has great art but the animation is so lacking.,0
589,Personally I consider it acceptable since it's not a battle shonen that's main focus is visuals.,1
590,"There hasn't been much that needs great animation, so I imagine they're conserving the very good animation.",1
591,"It probably comes from its 24 episodes budget, not all studios have the same amounts of those.",2
592,"I don't mind it. They talk a lot and as long as the most important thing, The Beautiful Visuals, are adapted faithfully, I'm content. so Far, I  am  content.",1
593,"As much as I dig the OP and the Outro, I truly wished that they refrained form putting in unintroduced characters and limited the characters shown in both to the characters currently introduced in that episode. One of the things I found most interesting about the anime was the fact that they would have to face all of it while being the only humans alive. Both the OP and Outro spoiled it for me. Instead of having the same WTF reaction Senku and the gang had when they saw the smoke signal, my reaction was ""Oh it's that blonde girl from the OP : """,1
594,You didn't have to watch it.    I've never watched the OP or ED. I listen to them but never look.,1

597,"Man 4 episodes in and I'm still on the fence about this one. I want to like it so bad, the story progression just doesn't sit right with me. I feel like I'm already supposed to be emotionally attached to all these characters but I'm really not, so these moments don't feel nearly as impactful as they should.",0
598,"Prologues are usually slow, and this is still the prologue after all. You have to set the stage for the world and conflicts if you want to have a great payoff.",1
599,"Don't worry, I didn't feel that way too when I read the manga until the second arc. I actually was about to drop the manga, but the second arc was so much better in the aspects you mentioned and actually made me attached to all the new characters introduced.     Though tbh, I'm still not really attached to Taiju, Yuzuriha and Tsukasa. But you should at least watch until the second arc, because it is imo far better than the first one. If you still don't enjoy it that much by then, this anime probably isn't for you.",1
600,"it feels like its been written by a 10 year old lol havent seen such bad storytelling and moral ""dilemmas"" in a while.",0
601,"My eyes have rolled so many times I have a fucking headache. That standoff felt like half the episode with a random flashback in the middle that I skipped after 5 minutes.    I still hate how the MC fucking yells everything he says. And the reasoning for him not just saying he likes the girl is just stupid. He basically said it without saying it and isnt doing anything by not just saying he likes her.     The villain's reasoning for killing is paper-thin  he wants to create a good society but doesn't want the scientific advances we've made, like medicine, and kills every statue he sees, not knowing if that person is good or not, and he holds an innocent girl hostage to further his own selfish means .     The scientist is an idiot if he thinks that the MC couldn't create enough pressure to ignite the gunpowder  also how didn't it all blow up? And why didn't they just drag the bag over to the jot spring? ",0

674,"I assume it will just make him mostly dead. Keikaku doori.      There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do. Go through his clothes and look for loose change. ",2
675,I can't believe Senku is fucking dead...,0
676,Tarzan! That's who he reminds me of.,2
677,That montage reminded me a lot of October Sky except with a supportive father,1
678,"the show is trying its best to discourage the viewers from copying the stuff they do in it....but considering how fkn crazy people are nowdays for attention in social media, i honestly wouldnt be surprised if later down the run, somebody is gonna copy something dangerous from the show and end up doing something bad",0
679,Doubt he is dead because you know. Anime. And he is in the opening ending enough times to be confirmed the main character. Kind of wish he would die though to make the series serious again. I personally like a serious theme more than this comedy kind of thing with random stuff popping up in the middle of the episode.,0
680,....huh?,2
681,For some reason I think Senku is still alive hmm... possibly plot armor lmao,1
682,I don't care about spoilers plz tell me what happens next does Senku live? Does he go back to being a stone? What happens plz,1
683,Can't believe Senku fucking died,0
684,"Yup, it was a short run for that character, but the rest of it really picks up. It was kind of a Psycho fake-out thing.",2
685,This is an amazing adaptation. The chapters that they've adapted so far were the worst parts of the manga so I can't wait for them to get into the good parts.,1
686,"I just watched the episode last night  well, binge watched all 4 episodes  and I think I might have caught a tiny detail?    When nital was mentioned I googled it to find out wtf that is, and wikipedia says ""A solution of ethanol and nitric acid will become explosive if the concentration of nitric acid reaches over 10%.  ...  Solutions above 5% should not be stored in closed containers.""    And IIRC our boy Senku told Tsukasa he needs  exactly  30% nitric acid for the stone-breaking solution. Maybe the anime is just ignoring chemistry a bit  or changing things around to discourage people from trying it at home?  but to me it kinda sounds like Senku planned it all 2 steps ahead and when Tsukasa tries to make the solution it would blow up in his face or at least fuck him up   this video     Idk if anybody still reads these threads a week late but I'd love some thoughts on this.",1
687,I don’t know why they made an episode like this so early.  The dude is the main character.  He’s not going to die.,1
688,"That's why it's such a twist, like Psycho.",1
689,Why was this anime overhyped again? So far it has been less than mediocre. All the characters feel plucked straight out of an early 90s trash shounen anime. Everything is so over the top to the point of ridiculousness. Meh.,0
690,Yeah this is obviously a battle shounen lol,1
691,"Nice episode, but I liked it less than the previous one.     Yeah, it gives a bit of background and some interactions between the characters, but essentially it ends with a cliffhanger and no real answer to what's about to happen in the story.         So yeah, not a bad episode, but definitely a slow one and since I am curious to see what's about to happen and to see all the other characters I can't say that I liked it as much as the others.    The background of Senkuu was kawaii af tho.",1
692,"I wont confess until civilization is rebuilt.  Hang on if you really think about it he waited 3,700 years to drop this girl.  So Cold.",2
693,You appear to have missed his point.    He's waiting until she has another option so as to make sure she doesn't feel trapped into saying yes.    I personally think waiting until modern technology is back is a bit extreme as she will probably have other options before then.,2
694,"It's going to take them 30 years to rebuild society, I call that being dropped in my book.",2
695,Anime logic I doubt it will take nearly that long,2
696,"Dam, I was hoping after the last 2 episodes the show would get better but its still as reliant on convenience and shounen tropes. I was gonna stick with it and probably just comment if theres stuff I did or didnt like but I just find myself face palming for a lot of the episodes and found it more boring the more it went on. Just gonna be dropping the series here. It might be from the manga readers that overpraised the series before it aired and I expected more from it, but it seems like a bland typical shounen that constantly contradicts itself. Im out, peace.",0
697,Elaborate.,2
698,"super predictable, the moral delimmas are a joke and very flawed. Tsukasa is literally a mass murderer  though im assuming later in the story senkuu prolly gonna find a way to join and revive the dead people...  but the other chars just like all shonen chars not willing to kill him.    boring and obvious cliffhanger where you 100% know senkuu cannot be killed but they still show it like something serious happened.",0
699,Agree completely. I'm still a fan of the manga because the rel appeal starts next episode when he finds a village of primitive people and teaches them about the wonders of modern science.,1
700,"     These are not morals, it's just subjectif ideologies clashing.          Because Tsukasa is not actually dumb and Senku was going to negotiate but things occured differently when the smoke signal show up.          For you.         Cliffhanger is mostly about HOW he could survived because the information we're about to have is the most vital in the manga.",1
701,I did in the previous episode. Anymore would just be repeating myself.,2
702,"Please come back again during season 2. By then, you might understand why the setup needed to be as such.",2
703,"lightning the fire was a bad trade-off. Without getting detected they still have the power to create a civilization but now with superpowered Tarzan able to kill them now that was not a good deal at all. As already mentioned there is likely a connection between Senku and Taiju's revival because of the time-frame. They could have just chilled a bit longer easily but y'know anime I guess. A few minutes into the episode so can't tell how it's gonna go but looking far less interesting than the first episode. Everyone getting stoned is interesting. An OP Tarzan 1 shotting Lions and shit is not very ""realistic"" inside of the created universe.",0
704,Him not confessing to her now is stupid. I don't get why so many anime go to such lengths to avoid romance in with their comedy adventure.     Also unearned cliffhangers are shitty and unearned. This was definitely a down episode for me. If you think about it you realize we're almost exactly where we were at the beginning of the episode with almost 0 plot progression and the character development was all flashbacks on science nerd bro that honestly anyone who was watching the previous episodes could have already guessed. Stock science nerd story is stock.     I really wanted this show to be badass but three episodes in now and almost nothing interesting has happened.,0
705,"I have to agree with you here, I really like the other 3 episodes and felt it was leading to something good but ep 4 took a strange turn.      I'm not sure if it's just because I've seen the trope too much but it doesn't really feel in his character to wait to confess.",0
706,"And ""waiting until the world is rebuilt?"" WTF is that? It could take decades before they even have a safe, agrarian community where they aren't having to scrape for food every day. Meanwhile serial killer cave man is running around. Waiting is idiotic and cowardly and the character seemed to be neither.",0
707,"Man, I hate these cliffhangers. The only good outcome for me would be if he would actually die but then the anime would kinda be over.     Does this anime really need such a terrible cliffhanger...",0
708,"The anime wouldn't need to be over. There's 3+ other people, and any of them could kill Tsukasa, and they could form a village together. And any one of them could be a scientist.",2
709,"...no? Tsukasa isn't willing to revive science, Taiju is too dumb for this and Yuzuriha also hasn't got that type of brain, she is more of a skilled manual worker. There is no way to learn science from scratch, so there is no way any of those 3 would be able to do it. To the killing Tsukasa point... nope. He is superior to any of them in every way and would be aware of his only weakness, gunpowder. He would 100% take care of that",2
710,"Man, this episode really, really, really stretched my suspension of disbelief to its limits, then you have those cartoony scenes where they are making gun powder in the modern world, then a mecha Senku pops up out of nowhere  I know, I know, this is a sketch, but still... , and then that eye-rolling cliffhanger. Like, I just can't be impressed by any of the sci-fi elements when the story is near completely void of logic and common sense. What a shame. Its nothing more than a goofy comedy  based on the 4 episodes to date .",0
711,"The mecha senku scene was more of a ""please don't sue us for showing this"" scene than a sketch",1
712,"geez, that anime is bad. overhyped asf.",0
713,"They really drug out that standoff, didn't they?    Also I still don't understand his reasoning and how he determines who lives and who dies. It seems like he destroyed a bunch of statues whom he didn't know was a good person or not, which defeats the purpose of him trying to make society better, just like not having someone who knows basic science would make society better  for medical reasons . And him killing the girl would also defeat the purpose since he'd be one of the bad guys.    This guy is really the ""hypocritical bad guy is bad because of reasons"" cliché in a nutshell.",0
714,basically he wants kids to live and adults to die,0
715,"You're just looking at good and evil from your moral framework, rather than from his worldview and goals. He explains his views in the second episode. Tsukasa didn't like the world of 3700 years in the past, a world were everything is already owned and where the young are robbed of their future.  his words  He likes the freedom of the new world and wants to retain that. He prioritises that freedom over the lives of people, making murder not hypocritical to his beliefs. If science would end that paradise, it must be stopped. If anything, his beliefs makes murder necessary.     He is just radical in his beliefs, not hypocritical.",2
716,The show is srewing with my brain,0
717,Cliffhanger Incoming,2
718,I'm not believing for a second that Senku is actually dead,1
719,I dont think tsukasa killed or can kill senku if its just Stones he could do it without feeling guilt or remorse But Its a Different story when it comes to a living blood and flesh human,2
720,Cliffhanger :v,1
721,Now that's what I call a cliffhanger,1
722,"senku will not die that easily, right? time to rewatch the op to look for clues to be 1,000,000,000% sure he's still alive haha",1
723,"Well duh, I mean, when's the last time an anime character had an episode of backstory before kicking the buck-    FUCK",2
724,based dad,1
725,Delaying his confession...    Inb4 people become stone again for the second time and Taiju couldn't confess again,2
726,LET'S RISE FROM THE ASHES AND RISE TO THE TOP OF THIS MAGICAL VINE,2
727,"That was a much better episode. It's starting to get better, or probably because of the lack of Taiju and his screaming in it. :D",1
728,"I'm kind of conflicted on whether or not I want Senku to be dead. It's a better death than just having a character die off screen, to be used as plot device. However, I'm not sure if the series can survive plot-wise without Senku as he seems to function as vital part of progression. Plus, Senku is the most enjoyable character so far, IMO. The least flat character with the nicest visual design.",0
729,"Eh, he had a good conclusion, his dream will live on without him.",1
730,"His life felt so short-lived, especially since it's only episode 4. But I do think the series will be just as enjoyable without him.",1
731,"You really gonna do us like that, show? I'm guessing that Senku put something on his neck when he was cracking it. He knew that hitting that spot would be a painless one hit kill, so Tsukasa would naturally go for that spot.",0
732,Dammit. I'm going to have to read the manga arent I.,1
733,"Oh god, everybody here has 「R E S O L V E」",1
734,"i swear to god.   the girl shots look so weird in some shots.   the boys look completely fine. but when the original manga artist tries to do some panels with the girls being all embarassed or cute, it looks KINDA WEIRD.    but the series is pretty good so far. :D",1
735,"I've once tried to make black powder on high schol lat chesmtry class, so i can confirm what mecha-senku said, it didn't go well.     ;    Meanwhile, the motherfucker made a fucking space rocke twhen he was 11.     cries in having no future    ",1
736,"Don't know if I should start the manga or not, I am always so conflicted.      ;    If I am reading a manga first I'd love watching the anime later. But if I start an Anime I feel I would ruin all my experience",0
737,Me at the beginning of the EP:    ;･o･        Me at the end of the EP:    ╯ □ ）╯︵ ┻━┻   god damn it Senku got Eren'd     Come on his 10B% alive right! Right?,1
738,Biggest cliffhanger in anime history,2
739,"Tsukasa needs a long trip to beyond the stratosphere via that volcano, till he goes back to rock form and stops thinking.",2
740,Lets just stand at our smoke signal and hope he doesn't murder us!,1
741,"I don't know what that says about me, but I can't force myself to like Tsukasa  or Garou from OPM  no matter how hard I try. I'm just intrinsically opposed to their philosophies. Though I know they both have a lot of fans. Really curious to see how Senku gets through this one.",2
742,Seeing that white smoke was a real shock I did not think that there were others groups of people around. Nice to see Senkuu get to be as smart as he is and how he achieved his dream.,1
743,BOIIIIIIIIIIII fuck yea I'm gonna watch this later today. I was hooked the moment I checked this one out.,1
744,"character models a little inconsistent this episode, but no biggie! flashback did a nice job to reiterate senku would never give up on science, his friends and adults  his dad funding his ambitions .     senku probably gonna live tho since this is a shonen jump series haha",1
745,so anyone got a phineas and ferb vibes from senku building contraptions at a young age?,2
746,"lol get fucked    he's defo not dead, but what a way to end an episode.",1
747,Ichinose Kana kind of sounds like Hanazawa; I had to look her up to check.,1
748,Was Senkus Dads VA Keiji Fujiwara?  Mae's Hughes VA?  I don't see him credited anywhere,1
749,"""I thought of nothing but confessing to you for the past 3700 years. But now that we're 2 of the last 4 people on earth, it'll be pretty awkward if your reject me. So just wait until we repopulate the planet, OK?"" And holy death flag batman!    Anyone esle find it offputting how Yuzuriha only ever parts the center of her lips when she speaks?    What I don't understand is why Tsukasa took so long to find them. He was after them at fool speed as soon as he came back from the cave, he should've caught up to them even before they reached the hot springs.    Why did Senku need to light another fire? If he really wanted to meat the people who responded with their own smoke signal, he could've just come to them.    Middle School Senku not only committed all types of aviation violations with that unauthorized rocket launch, but also polluted the orbit with more debris.    All Senku had to do was tell 1 lie. ""Can't tell a lie about science."" What a maroon.    Next episode: Senku gets Isekai'd somewhere.",2
750,"Oh no, Yuzuriha is weird looking all right. Uncanny  anime  valley is her game.",0
751,"To be fair, it was likely  extremely  low orbit, and that stuff would have burnt up quickly enough.",2
752,It would only burn up if it fell back down to earth.  Which wouldn't happen if it's actually in orbit.,2
753,"That's not quite how orbits work. Most orbits are not perfectly stable, they require constant adjustment to keep on track.  Some  atmosphere exists for up to thousands of miles above the surface, even though we consider most of this ""space"" since it's so thin, but this does cause drag. ""Orbit"" just means it'll make at least one reasonably stable lap, and those likely could make hundreds, even thousands of laps, but at some point the drag would bring them closer to the thicker parts of the atmosphere, probably within years. It's also worth considering that after 300 years, probably every satellite humanity has put up would be gone, with most of the lower ones burning up, and the ones in higher orbits smashing up, and a lot of their contents either burning up or flying out of our orbit.",2
754,"It's not only about not lying about science, how many people would rather die than bend the knee? I know I would.",1
755,"""Bend the knee""? He only needed to pretend until he could get away or otherwise get the advantage.    If you see a murder happen, and the murderer tells you ""I'll kill you unless you give me your word you'll never tell anyone."" would you respond with ""Go ahead and kill me then!""?",2
756,Son of a ... cliffhanger. Although I am one million percent sure he lives. Is it the blonde girl who intervenes? Will she be Senku's girl?,2
757,"He cracked his neck earlier, I think that's gonna matter a lot.",2
758,"So what is this, like a Kira moment where what actually happened was the American Amazon coming in to save the day? I'm excited to find out",1
759,I need grapes,2
760,Senku was on a mission with them experiments,2
761,Hmm maybe senku got some stone leftover on his neck idk how he’s gonna survive that but he’s the mc so he will,2
762,"Good episode! I'm bummed Yuzuriha lost her beautiful long hair but she's still great. There was a lot of flashback but I enjoyed it, learning how these characters were in the past. Apparently all 3 are old friends. And Senku seems to have a good family where his dad support's Senku's passion of science, and this person is now going to save the world.    Also the anime is great at showing you how Senku is a man of logic but he's also ""human"". That's what makes him a winner. At the beginning you assume everything is logic for him but as each episode passes, you learn that's not always the case. He would never trade any of his friends for any secret he holds. And he'd let himself die with honor to science rather than logically saving his life. I'm totally rooting for Senku to wreck Tsukasa.",1
763,"Everyday we learn something new, today I learned how to make explosive material. Thanks anime",1
764,"Fun show, good run, sad conclusion. Really thought he'd restore humanity, oh well.",1
765,"He gets resurrected by the dragon balls, its obvious",2
766,I hope Senku did not die even tho it looked like it in the end of this episode.. Dr. Stone would not be Dr.Stone without him!! I will wait patiently for the next episode..,1
767,"Alright, raise your hands if you're now reading the manga?",1
768,Been reading since the end of episode 3.    Amazing read especially if science interests you.,1
769,"Taiju is gonna end up being that guy that should be most people's favorite, but he isn't because of the writer making him have dumb reasons to not do things  like fight back and confess .",1
770,How did Taiju know they were in danger came running back even though he was so far away?,2
771,Could someone tell me with spoiler tags if he’s actually dead or not,2
772," ""Both"" ",2
773,Anybody know the song that plays right when he tells them to light the smoke signal? I cant find it anywhere.,1
774,ey man did you find the song in the middle    the lyrics go something like this if im not mistken: lets rise from the ashes of   clowns?   on the top of this magical vine.,2
775,Hey man just found it yesterday it’s called “I”m a Master if Minds” by Aztech from Hybrid Thoughts,2
776,"This series keeps reminding me of older movies. Tsukasa's whole ""world purification"" angle  as wholly un-thought through as I think it seems  made me think of Logan's Run, even if the actual themes are fairly different. And then we had this episode with Senku's rocketry, which made me think of October Sky.        Aside from the accidental nostalgia, I also figured I'd mention  fairly late, at least  with how Senku's harvesting bronze from the Great Buddha statue doesn't seem as disrespectful as it did at first. Mainly because I remember hearing that one of Buddhism's teaching is something along the lines of ""When these teaching are of no use, cast them aside."" The statue itself could still have some motivational spiritual influence, but how much of that is really necessary in that stone world of their? Harvesting bronze from it for the sake of technological advancement survival seems almost noble, even if the entire scene was played for laughs and to show how unconcerned Senku is with spiritualism.",1
777,Honestly I like this anime a lot more when its a bit more serious. Not that I dislike the goofy fun stuff but there's just something about the tone in this episode that felt really good. Super excited to see how this goes,1
778,So Senku was basically phineas and ferb,1
779,"I know the way it is done here is for the sake of the story, but wouldn't it be a lot safer to soak all the ingredients in water first, then pound them together to a fine paste, then let said paste dry?",2
780,I don’t know why. But I love it when two rival characters in anime admit that they’re just victims of circumstance and that they’d be friends in any other Society.,1
781,This episode was frustrating. On the one hand we got Taiju actually showing he isn’t a one note joke. He’s actually very intelligent at least when it comes to people. And Yuzu has shown signs of not just being a moe-blob romantic interest. She’s got a backbone and even when held hostage by a freak of nature she didn’t cower. I hope she keeps being great.     But on the other hand the stupidity of Senku and crew when it comes to Tsukasa is frustrating. I thought he screwed up the first time the gun powder exploded. But then they kept doing it. Tsukasa is basically unkillable and actually pretty smart. They can’t fuck around like that until they get a real deterrent against him. For someone so smart to decide to signal like that is just dumb.     And then he tells him the formula to revive people. And seemingly the true formula at that. Which immediately makes him easy to justify killing and giving a psychopath the ability to create his own world full of people just like him.     Maybe he was smarter than we thought. After the “cliffhanger” is resolved I’m hoping we see that there was another part of this “plan”.,1
782,God damn it cliff hanger!!!Aaah damn i cant wait a week to find out what happens,1
783,Best gori and 10000000000% best dad appeared!,1
784,"something that bothers me, how does taiju stays  that  empty brained after all the science experiments he's done with senku since childhood? is he being dumb for the sake of it?",0
785,"I'm 100% hooked this week wait is gonna feel like 3,700 years",1
786,yo manga people spoil me how does daddy senko live. He does...right? right?,2
787,"Im dropping this, too cliche.",0
788,"alright guys, now that senku is out of the way, time for the true protagonist to take the stage   the real dr. stone ",2
789,Senku gonna become the Stone Titan by episode 7.,2
790,Did they every explain how Senku was revived in the beginning of the show? I read the manga but I don't remember it.,2
791,Still no luck I’ve been looking but nothings come up yet which stinks.,0
792,Tsukasa's intellect is jarring.,1
793,oh man i believe 100% that he is definitely dead.,1
794, s,2
795,Fuck this cliffhanger TBH. That felt very cheap.,0
796,Any kind redditor wants to give me a guest pass?,1
797,"Ff83vc7end4    Jx57wnjsrr5    F48g6pmh63    It's $7 a month, it's worth it.",2
798,"Thank you kind sir     I'm getting a sub soon, but i just couldn't wait for this anime... Either way sorry for trouble and thank you ",1
799,So basically a high school student was able to send objects to space.    Anime logic 100,1
800,"While it is exaggerated, the way its portrayed didn't that illogical.    He was interested in doing so from a very young age and also jumped into researching at the same time. Then he also got the  very  generous backing of his father.    Couple this with the fact that he pursued this project diligently for let's say around 10 years, and the only illogical thing about this is that he was able to do that without getting in some kind of legal trouble.",2
801,"C'mon. That's like saying a kid playing with toy planes wanted to become a fighter pilot, so they became one at the age of 8 - it's not illogical.",0
802,"He didn't looked like 8 years old when he launched that rocket, did he?    Also, the kid in your example wasn't  playing with toy planes and said he wanted to be a pilot like little kids do.  The kid in this example explicitly said fighter pilot and then proceeded to gather all information about piloting a fighter jet that he could find. And he got enough financial aid from his dad to get a model replica of a cockpit of a jet.  And he did that for 10 years. Yeah, best believe by the time he's in Highschool the only thing stopping him from being an expert pilot would be that he didn't get to put his knowledge into practical use.    You're vastly underestimating what a person can do with enough funds and time when said person has a concrete goal and never loses sight of it.",2
803,They would be able to fly planes by the time they were in highschool though if they had been backed by their father like this.,1
804,"There are random people on Youtube that have shot rockets into near-earth orbit, it's difficult but not impossible. You could do it if you felt like it.",1
805,"There's quite a lot of tension in this ep. I'm also fascinated by how forward thinking Senku is, always coming up with new ideas and using science to back it up. So far he's definitely the one carrying the show.",1
806,Is just me? I am dying to spoil in the comments if Senku did die or not.,1
807,"I'm not a manga reader but, well, he's the main protagonist. Of course he won't die, or there will be a twist like Eren Jeagar early death in Attack on Titan.",1
808,"Dammit, don't spoil the part about Rock Titan Senku.",2
809,LMAO. :D,1
810,yeah bro the mc died in the 4th ep of a 100+ chapter manga and not just generic shonen cliffhanger shit.,1
811,"I really felt the tension in the standoff for a second,  until he tried to kill the main character  due to others pointing out Yuzuriha not being in the OP.",1
812,Yuzuriha is in the OP though?,2
813,"You know that science guy in the intro with the 2 beakers and Senku, I could actually believe that Senku dies here and that guy becomes the science guy.",1
814,"No way, Senku's gotta mentor him first",1
815,Anyone has a link to that rap song in the  middle?,2
816,ey man did you find the song in the middle    the lyrics go something like this if im not mistken: lets rise from the ashes of   clowns?   on the top of this magical vine.    pls reply if you find it,2
817,can we talk about how senku pulled the potassium nitrate out of his ass.    cause he sure as hell didnt get it from grinding up seashells.,0
818,"It is told during the making of the gunpowder. He got it from the cave, by which I assume the bat cave Taiju was in. Wikipedia mentions bat guano as a source for Potassium Nitrate as well, so it seems to check out.",2
819,"I really don't like how people say this anime doesn't make any logical sense, but the logic of it is based on actual science and how to make those things they are making. Really makes you wonder if the people criticizing know what they are talking about",0
820,"“Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.”",0
821,"I don’t think Tsukasa’s idea of “bury Yuzuriha’s statue so she can’t be taken hostage” is as smart as he thinks it it. It’s already established that some people’s petrification can be broken somewhat randomly  i.e. without the miracle fluid , so it’s very possible that she could be spontaneously revived while buried and suffocate to death immediately.",0
822,"     Please no, the show never stated that.",0
823,Isn’t that what happened to Senku and Taiju?,2
824,I always assumed Taiju revived due to being in that cave with the bat shit dripping on him and Senku got lucky in his placement,2
825,"The problem is that is that the revival fluid isn’t  just  bad shit, it’s a mixture of bat shit and alcohol.",2
826,Yeah I know but maybe it speeds it up?,2
827,"The nitric acid is enough to cure the petrification, but it takes a huge amount of it, and a much longer time. The revival fluid is just a mixture that makes the cure waaay more efficient.    And Senku was the one who lucked out by ending up under the bats. Then, once he was freed, he moved Taiju there.",2
828,"If you mean that it doesn't make sense for him to be in a cave, don't forget its been 3700 years. Written human history began only around 5000 years ago. They've been petrified for over 10 times the length the United States has existed as a country. That is a really goddamn long time, and him ending up in a completely different environment is expected.",2
829,“Oh no he’s dead” said everyone with a bored look in their faces.,2
830,"I don't get why you're getting downvoted into oblivion when the whole ""one of the main characters is dead, but they're not"" is so overused and uninteresting.",2
831,"Why is she still wearing headphones?  I really hate this anime so far.  It is completely uninteresting.    Gunpowder is useless without a gun and you need some pretty advanced metallurgy for them.  Just make some poison instead, lie to the psychopath that you are on his side and put it in his food.  Problem solved.    This could be an interesting show of how to reboot civilization, but instead of man -vs- technological collapse, its man -vs- stupid man.",0
832,     Because they are not.         Wha- what ?? Don't you see the episode ? Senku was not actually trying to kill Tsukasa but to negotiate until they found out that they were not alone and that changed everything.         It's really not.,2
833,Uhhh... what? Have you been watching the anime at all? Senku is clearly not so spineless as to use poison.,2
834,I want Senku to actually progress from stone age to more modern. Its already been 4 episodes yet they still stuck in stone age. At this rate he wont ever get to space in his life time unless he finds a way to extend it.,0
835,"Do you really think that with only raw materials, without ANY tools for excavation and refinement they would be able to make modern civilization in fucking half a year? also they were only 2 people for those 6 months, which makes it even slower. The episodes after Tsukasa was revived took place in less than a week, so they had 3 people for a week. Are you really this dumb to think that they would just straight up move past most eras worth of technology in 6 months whithout any material and only 2 people? Damn people criticizing this show are dumb",0
836,...their pace of advancement is very fast all things considered. Rome wasn't built in a day.,2
837,Rome is not modern city if his goal is to build something like Rome then he wont be able to catch with today technology at all as he wants.,0
838,"It's a saying, you're not meant to take it literally.",2
839,Rome was more advanced than many of today's societies.,2
840,It was advanced in its time but not today time.,2
841,There's literally just one and it's not really being dragged on.,2
842,Nanatsu No Taiza does the opposite and it was so fuckin' irritating and boring so I'm good with that,0
