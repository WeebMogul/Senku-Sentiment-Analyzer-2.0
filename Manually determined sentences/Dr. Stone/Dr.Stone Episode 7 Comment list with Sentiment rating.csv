0,"All this episode reminded me is how much I miss Chrome in the new manga arc. Seriously, he's the best.",1
1,I like how they adapted the scene where Senku explains everything to Chrome. It's more impactful and it allows the audience to get Chrome's emotions a lot better than in written form.,1
2,"I very much enjoy this scene in manga and again in anime.    Really make you appreciate how far the we've come, and how much we took for granted.",1
3,"An important foreshadowing on this episode for manga readers:      ""Ishigami village got their ""outsiders are evil people, just like stone statues"" from the island of origin, where the bad people are turned to stone by the chief people and dropped on the sea outside the island."" ",2
4,I wonder what the genesis of that is.,2
5,"I don't think so. My theory is that they genuinely don't believe there are any people in the world other than the villagers, and if there is anyone out there it  must  be someone who was exiled long ago, so they can't be good people.  ""I don't think they are actually aware of the other island even though they have Soyuz in their ranks  who we actually saw in today's episode! "" ",2
6,"Here's a full list of the villagers and their names that the anime has left out, 40 people in total     First    Second       Also this amazing page of a proud Senku ",1

8,"     I hope anime is simply shuffling the reveal order, perhaps  ""after senku becomes the village head"" ",1
9,"They said excluding the old people and the kids, so Senku's monkeysphere calculation recently wasn't exactly right it seems.",2
10,I can't wait to see my dear Suika next episode! uwu,1
11,I can't wait for my dear Suika to see.,1
12,"Yes! And to see my dear Suika's face. I've seriously been estimating which episode she'll be introduced in and counting down since the first episode.  That moment when she got glasses was so relatable for me, cuz I also have the fuzzy eye disease, not as bad as her, something like 5 20 vision now, but I didn't realize until I tried on someone else's glasses and I was amazed by how much of the world I wasn't able to see before.",1
13,Am I tripping or did they forgot the ''calculation battle'' between Chrome and Senku ?,2
14,They skipped it    Edit: nevermind that was it. They'll explain it later iirc,2
15,What ? I laugh my ass of reading it like BRUH...,1
16,"I hope they add it in later as an aside, just like they did in the manga.",1
17,It was in the episode around the 15 minute mark,2
18,It's expanded in chapter 18.    Edith actually I misremembered it. It's the same.,2
19,"     You didn't misremember. The details of arithmetic battle was inserted later as bonus pages.      EDIT:   End of chapter 22,  here you go ",1
20,Ah I see. Too bad they didn't include it. Maybe later in a special.,1
21, Are you referring to this at the end of chapter 18 as there is nothing beyond that ,2
22,My bad. Although I could swear Senku explained how he beat him at some point later. Some arrithmetrick was employed.,1
23," ""who's hungry for ramen?"" ",2
24,"I don't but I would really want a  ""coke""  right about now.",2
25,"It's all about the  ""cotton candy"" , my dude.",2
26," ""i like that they are adding little details like kohaku knowing some english words, idk if other villagers will speak it too. update: yeah kinrou and chrome did speak some english words too.. nice."" ",1
27,Not reading your comment because I'm not up to date but your spoiler tag isn't working.,2
28,"thanks, had to switch to old reddit just to have it work..  ",1
29,"Yup! it was a neat little thing, but really hammered the point.",1
30,What chapter is this on the manga? I want to start reading,1
31,Either 18 or 19,2
32,Next week Suika...with Gen as cliffhanger,2
33,Can someone spoiler the antibiotic he makes? Only the name. No details or if he considers a different one first but fails.,2
34,"it's in chapter 20. And the name is  ""'sulfur drug from rocks'"" ",2

44,"I loved the first 6 episodes but I'm already loving this arc twice as much.       Chrome's personality and character design makes him seem like he's the MC in a regular anime, while Senku is like the rival he's constantly trying to catch up with. It feels fresh to have them be on the same side",1
45,"     Exactly this. It became much more interesting as soon as Senku met the other tribe.    Before it was:     ""Senku and the gang from the modern age try to revive the world while a 10th generation Joestar tries to hunt them down""    And now its:    ""Senku uses his knowledge and power to move primitive people who never knew how amazing the world was from stone age back to the modern age. While the Joestar is nowhere to be seen.""",1
46,"     Oh boi, did Araki really manage to get to part 10 in the last 3,700 years? This is amazing.",1

58,Make sure to use https,2
59,wait it came back? I thought that panda was gone for good?,2
60,"it came back after like 1 week, some rich guy funded transfer of the servers",2
61,"wow, thank you for the heads up.",1
62,what is this unhappy panda thing?,1
63,It is better known as SadPanda.    It is the modern day Library of Alexandria and it was almost lost to us a few weeks ago.,2
64,And how we feel about censorship on the new library we call Internet.,2
65,"Nah, that we can still manage. But the library is lost forever.",0
66,Can we have an F?,0
67,Haven't seen anyone talking about how the villagers sometimes mix english words in their speech and Senku repeats them in japanese to make it more clear.    Its not something that can be easily translated in text like sub or manga.,2
68,"Yeah, I'm not fluent in Japanese so I'm sure I missed some times, but I realized that was going on when Kohaku said there were ""forty"" people and Senku said ""yonjuunin""  I think . It makes sense though, I'm assuming some of the revived people were foreigners who would speak English or something, especially with the diverse hair colors among the new civilization.",2
69,"I dont know if we can take the hair colour thing as given, seeing how Senkuu has natural white hair with turquoise tips.",2
70,"That's true, honestly I didn't even consider that LOL      I guess I'm just really used to anime characters having whatever hair color, but blonde being the ""THIS IS A FOREIGNER!!!"" indicator?  shrug ",1
71,They omitted that line from Tsukasa upon meeting Kohaku,2
72,He's the beautiful love child between a man and a leek.,1
73,Truly a feat of science,1
74,Didn't senkuu say something about her being a foreigner when he noticed the blue eyes and blonde hair?,2
75,"Huh, I've read the manga, but even I didn't know about that.    That is a very interesting catch.",1
76,"I'm more astonished that they talk fluent japanese with this mixed english while we at the moment have not any idea about the moment they came back. Did they even got petrified ? At the actual moment, nobody knows.",1
77,Oh wow nice catch,1
78,"Yeah, as a manga reader i noticed that too and when it clicked why it was amazing. You'll learn why this is eventually",1

105,"She's no waifu, she's VALUABLE HUMAN LABOR",1
106,Fun fact;  Kohaku means amber. Probably a reference to her hair color.,1
107,"Quite a few  if not all  of the villagers are named after rocks and minerals and metals, actually. Besides Kohaku and Chrome, there's Kinro and Ginro  'golden wolf' and 'silver wolf', hence the spear thing , and then Jasper and Turquoise, Ruri's attendants. And I think 'Ruri' is a reference to lapis lazuli from the translator's notes somewhere on the scans?  There's more but I'm just naming the ones introduced this episode. :P",1
108,"I was skeptical of Chrome at first, as he didn't really appear that interesting to me. But by the end, when he cries for the millions of years of human scientific evolution lost in the Stone World, that really resonated with me. Honestly this is something we haven't really seen before. The other characters knew of the world before and that Senku has the ability to build it once again with his limitless knowledge. But we hadn't seen a person who didn't know that, that can only dream of the technology before the Stone World.     Chrome to me embodies the human curious nature, the will to discover and question the status quo. His genuine drive to discover and learn are just so endearing. I really hope to see him more, and if the OP is to go by, he seems to be one of the main protagonists : ",1
109,"Chrome really ends up being the heart and soul for this episode. He's a also a pretty solid person to interact with Senku. Instead of a big oaf, we got a Scientist  Sorcerer  in training!",1

119,Excellent point,1
120,I got a lot of blue crystals from gacha games : ,2
121,"As an anime reader   yes i read anime deal with it  i'm pretty aware of it.    Hell the bs that ""Taiju was the MC on the first chapters"" its unbelievable taking into account THE DAMN NAME OF THE STORY.",2

131,Nerdy kids instantly bonding across a millenniums-wide generational divide over their shared love of gathering pretty rocks is extremely relatable.,1
132, Senku and Chrome ,2
133,"Chrome is great because at a base level he shares a lot of Taiju's ""simple but earnest"" character traits, but he also combines that with a genuine enthusiasm for science, which makes for a far more interesting foil for Senku than Taiju's ""dumb oaf"" shtick. It also actually allows Senku to show more of his positive qualities as well, and show that he isn't just a pretentious dick who thinks he's better or smarter than everyone else, he genuinely just loves science and is actually thrilled to have somebody he can share that with.",1
134,That's why this show feels so much more alive with him and chrome talking. They just work off great with each other and Chrome's arc in the manga is probably my favorite.,1
135,"Senku seems to genuinely admire Chrome for being able to figure out and build up what he did starting from literal zero. Sure, Chrome isn't anywhere near Senku's level as a scientist, but he didn't have the entire aggregate knowledge of humanity to stand on.",1
136,"Thats the vibe I got too. Senku's moment when he realises that even if he died, there was still other humans that would pick up the torch and restart scientific discovery from scratch was great.    I think that really humbled him, to think that sure, he has all this knowlege, but it was acquired at the peak of civilisation, yet Chrome had started from absolutely knothing and was already making great strides relatively speaking. as a scientist, you can't help but admire respect that.",1
137,"Senku was standing on the shoulders of giants.    Chrome would have been one of these giants even without him.     His discoveries would have been the groundwork for other ""sorcerers"" to work with",2
138,"That's the impression I got. Senku was thinking that he  himself  would have never done the ""idiot"" work necessary to get the science ball rolling if there wasn't ground work already in place for him. That he would probably be one of the ""extras"" in this world if he never knew about science",1
139,"He totally would join in as well, nothing can stop his love for science.      Instead of idiot work he dismissed it as elementary school science experiments, until it hit him that even our elementary or almost any minimum possible science knowledge in our world is still miles ahead of a primitive stone world.       Senku is probably exactly as inquisitive and curious as Chrome, the difference is that Senku had access to more stuff to experiment with.  he started out pretty basic in his flashback as well     Also I wouldn't be surprised if this guy is still leagues stronger then Senku just because of the world he grew up in",1
140,"Well, that's assuming he could successfully germinate his knowledge.    The amount of knowledge he acquired from literal 0 is  massive , especially for a teenager. And humanity doesn't tend to have the best reputation of accepting large scale change happening so fast.    The other people just think he's some weirdo who likes rocks, he'd have to invent something seriously impressive to start proving himself.     Senku was able to easily impress with feats of engineering, but chrome is more of an alchemist, so he'd be more likely to die from exploding himself in an experiment.",1
141,"Very good point  especially about him blowing himself up, lol .    In a small village like this people dont seem to mind what he does, but unless he discovered something imediately practical nearly all his knowledge would just be put aside and forgotten by the others.    Well unless he manages to find some other curious kid to mentor, which honestly sounds easier as a sorcerer alchemist then as a normal scientist in our times :p",1
142,assuming he doesn't get killed by religious extremists...,2
143,"Yep, after watching this episode one more time, Chrome is officially my pick for best boy",1
144,"Yep. I like him as well, certainly a big upgrade over Taiju who was basically an airhead.",1
145,Some still say Taiju is still collecting shells on the beach. Still collecting.,2
146,"He knew that science is what's gonna heal Ruri and every other human who suffers like her, and after hearing what Senku told him about how advanced the world used to be, and how many opportunities lost because the world is petrified, he felt sad and angry.",1
147,"i mean think about it. Chrome grew up probably watching countless people die around him from sickness or starvation and knowing that in the modern age, Ruri's illness wouldn't be deadly just an inconvenience. Of course he'd be angry.",1
148,"I didn't even think of it that way.     Shit, knowing that would make me livid",1
149,"Cause in the Stone World, no doctors, no medication and hearing about that age.    If Chrome had been born a modern day man, he would've probably gone on to become a doctor.",2
150,"no! his curiosity would make him a researched  no matter the field , doctors heal and he would not need to learn how to heal in our society right?",2
151,"Unless he wanted to. You can still choose to, if you wished. Or he could've gone on to become a pathologist or an engineer.    But that Chrome will never be born. We got the bright eyed, curious young scientist who's going to help change the world one step at a time with Senku now.",1
152,"Yeah, I mean, it's no wonder why the girl's sister was so worried about her. In a world without medication, even just a cut can be the death of you if you're unlucky.",2

154,"Chrome was just great.    I mean, Senku's one thing, someone who already knows all this stuff and how to apply it, but it gives me goosebumps to see a person who didn't realize something was possible before suddenly learn that a good thing  just might  be within reach and then vow to pursue it. It's a kind of ""moonshot mentality"" that I wish I saw more of in media.",1
155,"No, I mean, more shows that cover this topic, not just Dr. Stone. A Place Further than the Universe and parts of Steins;Gate are the closest I can think of at the moment in anime. Anne McCaffrey did it periodically in her Dragonriders series of books. I can't think of many well-written examples outside of those.",2
156,"Ah, yeah obviously in other media.     I was talking specifically about more moments like this in this show, even better ones. Little misunderstanding on my part there.    If we wanna have a more mature discussion about storytelling, stories are always a reflection of the time they are written in, and imho, we're simply and sadly not living in a ""moonshot mentality"" time at the moment. There is no ""we'll set foot on the moon"" of our times, and I think stories being written currently reflect that. Current Zeitgeist is more a warning of Pandoras Box, reflected in things like Black Mirror and other stories.    The closest I can think of in the spirit of this positive mentality is honestly old Star Trek, at least when it comes to morals. Which is also why the Star Trek movie was so god damn disappointing.",1
157,As a manga-reader; Chrome is best boi.,1
158,his interactions with senku made the manga so much better and the comedy of those 2 is brilliant,1
159,A fellow man of culture I see,1
160,Is the manga still a long way to its end?,2
161,Yes,1
162,It’s not even half done. Not by a long shot.,2
163,"Chrome is possibly the most endearing character in the manga, and yeah he’s one of the main protagonists",1
164,"that's exactly why he's my 2nd favorite char, only 3 characters missing from my top 5.",2
165,Kaseki. Kaseki.,2
166,Chrome is easily my favorite character. He gets better and better,1
167,"I hope they explain to us why he doesn’t know anything about the “old world”.    It seems like Senkuu is implying that people most have un-petrified hundreds of years ago, and these are decadents of those people.    Still doesn’t explain why nothing was passed down at all?    I would also love to get a canon answer if Senkuu’s hypothesis is correct. Like technically, it is possible that maybe some people never got petrified to begin with.    Either way is fine, just please give us an exact explanation!",1
168,"Bits and pieces got passed down, but let's be honest, most people don't pay attention in science or history or remember these classes. Most people also aren't Senku or Homare from Sounan desu Ka, and would be pretty helpless without technology. When every day is a struggle to survive, your vague memories of the periodic table isn't worthwhile info to pass to your kids.    I had to inform one of my coworkers last month that Alaska was not an island, and Mt. Fuji is a real place in Japan.",2
169,Really? He thought ALASKA was an island? How?,2
170,"Because US mapmakers tend to throw it in a box along with Hawaii and sometimes Puerto Rico on the bittom left hand side of the map, and then some don't draw in Canada to help communicate that it's attached to a landmass. TL;DR, she had never taken time to really look at a full map of the world before, which is a surprisingly common issue in the US.",2
171,"That's so weird. Maybe i, as a non north-american, always saw the america map as a kid which clearly shows Canada and Alaska right there.",2
172,"True but what about buildings, plane, technology? They didn’t pass it down that humans used to be able to fly and travel insanely fast?    Chrome clearly knew nothing about the old civilization, so I’m confused what happened here.",2
173,"What would they pass down? Just the simple fact that humans used to be able to fly and travel insanely fast? What can they even do with that information?    ""We used to be able to do all these amazing things.""    ""How?""    ""IDK LOL""    It's not unreasonable that, somewhere along the line, people started thinking these ""knowledge"" are useless and abandoned them and started focusing on not starving or freezing to death.",2
174,"     Inspire, of course. Much as birds first inspired us, one could use the tales of the old world to give everyone goals to achieve.",2
175,"Suppose Atlantis existed and was a completely lost technological civilisation from 10,000 years ago, and suppose the myth of Icarus was really what remained of the memory of them using gliders to fly. Would we  ever  think of it in that way, or just think it was a random fantasy story?",2
176,"I mean you say that but that is more or less how the people of old used to do things. Hear stories or observe things and become inspired, then inventing.    Flight is the most obvious example here. It's easy to see what inspired humans to try flying, and we have a decent length history of people attempting and failing to do it before the Wright Brothers.    That said, a story such as Senku's is much better the more of the information you can preserve. In your scenario, the main issue is that a lot of information is lost completely and so the story completely changes form.    In Senku's case, he has the means to record it all, and with his genius he could probably find a way to mass-produce that information once survival isn't a priority. The depth of knowledge he can preserve not only inspires but informs, and stands as a good reminder of ""This is what we can achieve if we put our minds to it. Use that brain, knuckle-head.""",1
177,"Well, my point is more, without specific instructions, those stories  based on reality  will do no more good than inspiring as much as a myth could. And their reality will also be lost to time, so that destroys the element of certainty that comes with knowing that at least it  can  be done.",1
178,Maybe for some reason they decided not to tell their kids and pass it down? Either they gave up such things as being lost forever or someone like Tsukasa won?,2
179,"Reminds me of Yugas in Indian mythology. Humanity goes through a cycle of 4 periods. In the first and best period humans are much taller, live much longer, there is no crime, no agriculture or mining has to be done because the earth yields the wealth automatically, etc. After a few centuries such stories of technology would sound like mythology that doesn’t literally exist or is seen as religion, such as Astra superweapons described in ancient Indian battles.",2
180,"Maybe someone like Tsukasa was around in that earlier awakening and higher knowledge was suppressed.

191,There is an explanation pretty much later in the manga.,1
192,Just wait for it : ,1
193,"That honestly seems realistic to me.  We don't know how old these people are, but let's assume we're dealing with at least two generations if not more.    Any normal person who got revived in the world of Doctor Stone would be lucky if they could make everything that we see in the village.  They'd barely be able to get subsistence farming going at best if they're a modern person.  So after that original person or people die, they take a lot of knowledge about how things were and at most leave stories about it.  Give it a few more generations and that would be forgotten, leaving a pretty primitive society.    The unrealistic stuff is Senku being a walking, actually useful Wikipedia and thus able to rebuild everything.",1
194,"They do know  something ...  ""The 100 tales XD."" ",1
195,"Senku said what I was thinking exactly when you meet Chrome. He perfectly embodies how humanity has continued to grow over all these years; with, as you say, a complete curious nature. It shows that even if Senku hadn't woken up or any other man of science really, that curiosity would have driven things forward no matter what",1
196,"Maybe a bit of a spoiler but to me Chrome ends up being as good a scientist if not better than Senku. Senku is clearly smarter but Chrome's curiosity and willingness to learn and innovate are what really drives the science world, not just brains.",1

203,I think this episode just set in.... stone that I fucking love this series. Chrome is just great!  A primitive man who's made scientific progress on his own. It really brought back memories when I used to be very studious and curious about a lot of science in general.,1

209,"Hurray, science buddy! In a lot of ways Chrome has given Senku exactly what he needed, which was a stockpile of potentially more difficult to find minerals and plants it seems. This should accelerate things quite a bit I'd imagine.",1
210,Considering that Senku is planning on making an antibiotic. Thats a pretty big step.,1
211,"It’s not a huge step, given that he has all of the materials he needs. My bet is he’s going to make a primitive form of penicillin.    I’m also taking a bet that Ruri has some kind of lung or throat infection, probably bronchitis or pneumonia, given the coughing",2
212,"Making penicillin is pretty easy. But making enough of it, and purifying it to actually be useful is no mean feat!     Here's the patent of the first process that worked.     You need a decently stocked chemical lab to produce useful quantities of the stuff. You could go the lowtech route and just use the acid step at room temperature, but you'd have to commandeer and rot a large part of the village's food supply to get enough of the damn antibiotic!",2
213,"     how?    it always boggles me how scientist able to find something new on unexpected place like that. like, what goes through their head that made them goes ""i think i'll check that rotten melon""    same like the new water bear species found on a moss patch in a parking lot",2
214,"They had some hints. First of all, the penicillin that makes your bread moldy only grows on surfaces. So it is really hard to produce it in large quantities as you'd need loads of surface area.    Ideally you want a mold that acts like yeast: Doesn't need a surface, just dump it in a big barrel with foodstuffs and let it do its thing. So they knew they had to look for molds that grew in fruits and other roundish things.    Secondly you want a mold that grows fast. If it grows too slow, all the foodstuffs gets eaten by other crap and there's nothing left for the mold.    So they set up a worldwide search where scientists would take soil samples, rotten food, garbage dump samples and so on, and see if anything grew at an appreciable rate. If it did, they'd send the sample to the lab, which checked if the mold actually produced a good quantity of penicillin. It was during WW2 so they were kinda desperate to find something ASAP to keep the soldiers from dying, so funding wasn't an issue.    Took 4 years, but eventually they found a suitable strain in that moldy Melon. Then they blasted it with X rays to force it to mutate into an even higher yield strain. And THEN they could finally mass produce the stuff.",1
215,     YEAH SCIENCE,1
216,Yeah that mind numbing hard work is a staple of science.,1

224,Digging in garbage to find something that will cure them from all the disease from digging in garbage,2
225,"Louis Pasteur was looking for a way to cultivate bacteria and hadn't been successful until one day one of his lab assistants forgot a baked potato in the lab and the next day it had all this weird spots, they saw them in a microscope and realized each spot had one specific kind of bacteria in it.    This eventually led to petri dishes",2
226,Its always a mixture of Vague idea's and luck when it comes to scientific discoveries.     Very seldom are they found on purpose. The general idea is known but the thing discovered usually isn't,1
227,"Yeah, but that was what, in the 1930-40s? It’s not like Senku is going to be figuring this shit out for the first time. He grew up in an era that has streamlined processes. He’s not reinventing penicillin, he’s taking his knowledge of modern medicine, taking what he has on hand, and with a little bit of shounen protag luck, making science happen. It won’t be that difficult, relative to his previous goal of making guns while being chased across stone age Japan by a JoJo caricature",2
228,"Modern day streamlined processes generally focus on increasing the production yield. Which requires waaaaay more advanced crap. The Minimum Viable Strategy is what I mentioned in the second paragraph. Which is: rot half the foodstuffs of a minor village, separate out the penicillin with some kind of acid. And then hope that nothing toxic got into the resulting mixture that you feed to the patient.",2
229,Dr. stone tends to streamline or simplify things simply so they don't spend 80 years actually trying to do shit. Such as the cart Senku made in the beginning of the episode. Something like that would probably have needed to take a day or more to build  at least to a point where it doesn't fall apart on a bump  but senku was able to build it no problems in around give or take 20 minutes.    The process and method will probably be boiled down to a very basic level with the yield he gains being drastically increased for times sake.,2
230,"With the power of manga, all you need is:    1  The required components     2  Possibly some tools     3  The infinite implied time between two panels to finish any manual labor",2

232,"If you've read the manga  Jin  he makes a warehouse with idiotic amounts of mold cultures in an attempt to breed the right one. It's a slow process, but it could work here too.",1
233,"The process doesn't seem ""soo"" bad...    First you make the fermentation broth of penicillin, which isn't described in the patent, but presumably you put the mold into a vat, feed it, and let it grow.    Next, you chill the broth to just above 0 C. You don't want to freeze it, but penicillin decays above 0 C, so you want to keep it pretty close to freezing.    Next, you filter it of any solid material. Strain it, centrifuge it, whatever.    Next, you add some acid to bring the pH down to anywhere from 2.0, and 3.5, although some care in selecting the acid is needed, otherwise you destroy the penicillin.    Next, you use a solvent to separate the penicillin from other acids. If I'm understanding this correctly, this is basically like adding oil  except with something like amyl acetate  to a water-mixture containing the penicillin. The penicillin prefers to hang out in the ""oil"", while this won't be true of all the other impurities. As part of this step, you're supposed to add water so as to attract anything that loves water and get rid of that too.    Next, you concentrate the penicillin with a base dissolved in water. Basically, you've got weak acids and strong acids and penicillin, so this step has your base react with all your weak acids so they drop out of the solution.    Next, you separate the various strains of penicillin by adding a slightly stronger acid. The stronger acid kicks the penicillin out of solution, and it precipitates out.    By now, the only acids in the solution are either stronger than penicillin or they are the ones you intentionally added... so, you just add another solvent, this time something like Chloroform, that attracts your penicillin and all the stronger acids hopefully stick to the rest of your solution, and you can extract it.    Next, you can remove a few more impurities by adding charcoal etc.    Next, you precipitate out the penicillin by adding an alkaline base. I think this should retain any acids that liked chlorofoam or whatever for some reason, but were stronger than penicillin.    Finally, you evaporate away as much of the liquid as possible by exposing the solution to a vacuum at low temperature... remember, this whole thing needs to take place as close to 0 C as possible without freezing.    That's it, right?    tldr: Filter, use a number of solvents and acids to precipitate or separate out any acid that isn't penicillin, precipitate out the penicillin, and finally, dehydrate for use.",1
234,"Yea it is pretty doable if you've got the materials and equipment. A dedicated hobbyist could whip up a batch in their garage if they wanted.    But Senko has to do this not in the modern age where all the solvents, refrigeration and pumps are readily available. He'll have to repeat the process in the stone age. Which means all of the required materials need their own production chain set up from scratch. The acid is pretty easy, but the rest requires some serious fucking chemistry setups.    The chloroform needs to be made by mixing methane and chlorine at 500 degrees, cooling the batch to liquid and then distilling it. The cooling down requires them to either wait until winter so they have access to ice, or to build a refrigerator  good luck building a fridge out of sticks and stones... . And don't even get me started on  the Amyl Acetate , whose precursors have another pretty convoluted production chain that can't easily be replicated with stone age tech.",1
235,"Except you don't ""specifically"" need chloroform... or any of the other chemicals listed explicitly. Don't forget, this whole process is designed to distill high purity, high yield penicillin. That solved a very specific problem... we had a massive quantity need of high quality, low mass, penicillin. And a need to separate the various strains of penicillin so we could figure out which one was best and prioritize making that one.    I'm no biologist, but you could probably get away with filtering out the solids and ingesting the resulting low-yield mixture at a higher dosage. If you couldn't do that, my instinct would be to precipitate out the lower strength acids, clean out the precipitate, and then precipitate out the penicillin and call it a day.    ""High Purity"" is more of a transportation, packaging, and optimization thing. It's not like your body will die if you ingest a little bit of water. Or acid. Your stomach is filled with acid. It's all about the dosage, and you only need to get the dosage to safe levels before you're good to go. It's only when you're mass producing the stuff because millions of people desperately need the shit that maximizing yield becomes critical.",2
236,"Yea, hence why they are probably going with the low tech method I described in my post:      ",2
237,"I mean. You need to rot the same amount of food stuffs regardless, no? You don't make more penicillin appear by concentrating it. You just get rid of impurities... which means the penicillin was there to begin with, regardless of how pure you make it.    The real concern is how good of a strain of penicillin you start with. Really good bacteria = great. Really shitty bacteria = terrible. BUT, knowing this anime, excessive hard labor is apparently instantaneously accomplished.",2
238,The problem is getting a good enough strain. They could use the strain that grows on bread but it would make the project take years to grow enough food to ferment as that strain is incredibly low yield.,2
239,"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if that was just a common cold. People used to die a lot from that before medicine was invented",1
240,"I don’t think a cold would ever last as long as they’re implying. I’m thinking a lung airway infection because of that, the coughing, and the fact Senku jumped right to antibiotics, so it’s gotta be serious. Antibiotics can’t help a cold or the flu",2
241,Could be TB?,2
242,"It very well could, I know both pneumonia and TB can be slowed with heat treatments so that makes sense",2
243,"Common cold is not cured by antibiotics. If someone were to die from common cold, it would probably be due to an opportunistic pathogen like TB sneaking its way in.    But viruses are never affected by antibiotics. Because they utilize host cellular machinery, any antibiotics would be Pyrrhic victories at best.",2
244,"I know that. It would be quite a funny twist honestly, if the antibiotic wouldn’t work because it’s something as trivial as common cold is, at least for our standards.",1
245,"Yea I was just pushing back on people dying from common cold. Stuff like flu was deadly, but it’s deadly today. With the exception of some very specific anti-virals being introduced, The mortality rate from virus have been fairly constant except for attendant co-infection , but rhino and enterovirus just lack the punch to kill people.    EDIT: and obviously a big help for flu and diahrettic viruses are treatment of symptoms, but again this does not really come into play with common colds where symptoms are minor.",2
246,"That's the wrong spoiler syntax.      This is the correct way.   ""Spoiler goes here"" ",2
247,Oh trust me he takes much bigger steps,1

She had been carrying a 50-litre pot back and forth a step hill several times a day in who knows how many years. For her sister. Damn siblings love is my weakness. She might be hot-tempered, easy to jump to conclusion, quite like a shounen male MC, a muscle brain, etc but she's strong, reliable, quick-thinking and best of all, genuinely care about those around her, not only her sister but also her friends. She's still my top1 favourite character till the latest manga chapter.  Also my top character based on manga newest ranking: 63182 .    And Chrome my boy! His voice here was just like I imagine. Can't wait for more of his spot light.    ""..There's always an idiot who'll try anything, and the shiny monkeys will inevitably create a technological civilization."" The science never lost, as long as there are human, who full of curiosity about nature, who want to grab the natural law in their own hands. The Human Technoogical Civilization will always rise, and rise and rise again no matter how many time you tried to shot it down. Because exploration is in human's nature. That simple line and Chrome introduction had moved me really much and the science-loving part of me cried out loud the first time I read it in the manga.

The ape civilisation in the books is much more modern compared to the one in the movie  in the movie, that was toned down for money reasons, it was cheaper to have them be more primitive , because they basically straight out took over from the pre-existing technological human civilisation. If it had been literally the same - down to the last city and monument - the protagonist would have been able to tell.

355,     I'm not sure I can. Senku loves science too much to gussy it up as magic. Even in this episode people kept saying 'magic' and sorcerer' and Senku just kept correcting his title to 'scientist'.,1

Senku  creating an antibiotic for her isn't a bad idea , even if Ruri doesn't have an infection, the antibiotic can still be useful to someone else in the future.     Chrome is a fun character!  There's really no stopping humans and progress. If Tsukasa wants to stop all of science then he might as well kill everyone who's alive in this world.       I do wonder what generation Kohaku and Chrome are. If the first human has awakened around a hundred years ago like Senku is guessing, they're probably around 4th or 5th generation.",1

373,I'd say the fair question as to what generation they are begs another question. If they are a fourth or fifth generation you'd think their ancestors would've passed down stories about the world as it had been before right? I mean we haven't really gotten into any kind of worldbuilding about these villagers yet but if they have no knowledge whatsoever about the world as it was before  even knowledge butchered down and metaphored the hell out of through the long game of telephone called human history  it may indicate that they may be older than that to the point where the stories have been forgotten. Or if that's not the case and these are in fact fourth fifth gen humans that begs the question as to why their ancestors didn't tell them about the world as it was before.      In either case I am most curious to see if these questions get answered.,2
374, A reenactment of the first generation trying to explain technology. ,2
375,True. But on the other hand humans are just as capable of coming up with religious beliefs as they are at scientific invention. Though whether it's something to do with the past or something more recent they've thought up it could go either way.,1

378,"I agree with this. Especially when the guards at the gate said that everyone outside is criminals who was banished from the village. They might not even remember that there are alive humans in the stones, but just think of it as something natural to their nature. Thus this generation might spann back a long time for their origins to be forgotten.",1
379,"Even if she's dealing with some viral disease, due to the lack of knowledge about hygiene or medicine and limited available treatments there's a good chance of contracting a bacterial infection like pneumonia.    The other easy medication I'd expect him to produce some kind of basic anti-inflammatory medication. Of the three plants we were shown, Felwort would make the most sense for a fever. Canker root can help with symptoms of Malaria but we can safely eliminate that as she'd already be dead. Sweetroot shouldn't even be in Japan so Senku should stay clear of it.",2
380,Sounds reasonable,1
381,"I had forgotten Kohaku mentioned Ruri had gotten sick recently, so originally I thought ""well maybe she's anemic.""     After her coughing though, it's definitely something simple like a cold. There's probably enough herbs in their area that could help with the symptoms  like the ones we saw and you mentioned , but if it's a cold then all they pretty much need to do is to make sure she's hydrated  water and herbal teas  and make sure she's getting enough vitamin C and all of that.    Though if it's just a cold and it's really debilitating her, she  could  be anemic  I don't know why that's sticking with me so much  or have something worse.",0
382,"I doubt it's anemia for the sole reason that that's not something Senku can really treat, especially as their deit likely contains lots of fruit & red meat so iron & vitamin levels should be fine.    Her collapsing due to the cough matches up with a bad chest infection, probably from pneumonia, which is also conveniently treated by antibiotics.",2
383,"That's true. I also can't imagine they don't waste iron richer organs of the animals they eat like the liver, kidneys, and heart.     The biggest thing would be that hopefully Riru doesn't have and autoimmune disease as well.",2
384,I assume Senku thinks it's TB.,2
385,"That's a possibility. I was puzzled when he said antibiotic, but animal TB can infect humans. But if so, she'll require treatment for months. I'd also expect Senku to go for a synthetic antibiotic - some, like  isoniazid  are relatively simple chemicals, compared to trying to find the right mold or bacteria and cooking away for years.",2
386,"Isoniazid would only work if it was TB or another mycobacterium though.  Senku can't be sure what she's suffering from at this time - in addition to TB, it could be another bacterial infection such as pertussus or pneumonia, a viral infection, exposure-based like emphysema, or something genetic.",2
387,"I was thinking TB in particular because it has a chronic form - most bacterial infections quickly kill you, but you can suffer from TB for years and still survive.  She's probably a bit young for chronic exposure problems like emphysema.  In my opinion, a heart lung injury or deformity, whether congenital or acquired is the most likely problem, but that wouldn't be treated using antibiotics, so given that Senku has decided to make some as a treatment, I think TB is his guess.",2
388,"That is the thing I am most curious about!     It seems like Senkuu is implying that people most have un-petrified hundreds of years ago, and these are decadents of those people.    That still doesn’t explain why nothing was passed down at all?    I would also love to get a canon answer if Senkuu’s hypothesis is correct.

Sure you'd know about how the world used to be, but odds are you would not have a clue how to science anything. All you'd be able to do is tell stories of how things used to be.

Someone who collects everything he can and learns as much as he can about what he's collected. That's the beginning of the scientific method. Certainly not all of it, but Chrome was getting there, even without Senku's help.    When Kohaku was thinking 'Why are these idiots so impressed with rocks', Chrome was demonstrating what he'd learned from them while Senku was gifting Chrome with what he already knew about them. Everything in that hut is marvellously useful. Chrome knows that. Senku is going to show him  how .",1

427,"Chrome's quite the eccentric guy, I appreciate that he represents the drive for scientific progress regardless of era. Rather nice of him to collect a bunch of materials that Senku needs to start his advancement.    Chrome really took that History lesson to heart, his scientific curiosity is pretty refreshing. I guess medicine really is the first important step here for them.",1
428,"The new direction they are taking is pretty good, even if it dragged on a little too much with waiting around for exaggerated reactions.    I hope they don't instantly let Senku persuade them, and we explore their cultural slowly accepting his fast-paced science revolution.",1
429,     Obviously once he heals their leader they are going to get behind him in full. That's why she's sick.,2
430,"Yeah that will likely be the case, but I'm hoping for at least some resistance.",1
431,I felt it could go either way honestly. The fact senku set up a little work station directly in front of the gate that they specifically mentioned he's not allowed to pass makes me think it could be half and half. Like he'll be working on medicine where everyone can see and probably ask questions as to what he's doing. He'll probably earn their trust except for the gold spear guy until senku asks to try the medicine out on the girl. Probably by taking some first to prove it's not poison or offering his life if she isn't cured. That would be my guess as to how it might play out.,1

438,"on the one hand it  is  awfully convenient. On the other hand, their reason for keeping him out is pretty nonsensical.

439,When they said that I assumed that they assumed that he was the offspring of an exile.,2
440,Yeah that's the implication,2
441,"Being suspicious of outsiders and not letting them in makes sense to me.    They're a primitive society with little if no knowledge of history and seemingly the outside world  which in world without telecomms and motorized travel makes sense, they wouldn't stray that far from water and their village .  The only people they know of for sure are people they're exiled from their village. They also know how fragile their community is.  An unknown illness or invasion could kill them all.    So they keep out anyone they don't know.",2
442,"I don't think you understand tribalism and how core it is to humanity.    Senku has shown them no benefit to his presence in their village, and letting an outsider in could cause any number of negative things.",2
443,Curious on why Senku thinks Ruri has a bacterial infection. Could be anything but hey I'm still hyped.,1
444,"Well, even if it isn't, making antibiotics should always be a priority if the resources are available. He probably decided to make it as if it is that it can be solved, and if that doesn't work then he will know that that's not the cause of her illness.",1

451,Dr Stone is a medical drama.,2
452,clearly what we need to cure her is mousebites,2
453,If it was a virus and her immune system didn't take care of it then she would either be dead or symptomless. A long term illness like this is almost exclusively the realm of bacteria. Given the health of the sister it's unlikely to be genetic either. But really it comes down to the fact that if it's not bacterial then there's nothing Senku can do to help anyways and this is his best shot to get the village to accept him quickly.,2
454,"Well, since they won't let him into the village to examine her, that's probably his best bet. It's definitely a gamble.",2
455,"I mean it makes sense, if it was something simpler they would have cured it by now. If it’s not bacterial then senku probably wouldnt be able to make a medicine anyway. Antibiotics cover a lot of different areas",2
456,"pretty much this. Treating viruses is way harder, and antibiotics would cover most bacterial infections unless they're resistant which is probably less likely when the selective pressures of antibiotics hasn't been around for almost 4000 years. ANd if it's genetic she'd be pretty fucked even with modern tech",2
457,"Yep, its the shotgun approach, and considering their living conditions, a bacterial infection is extremely likely if its isolated to a single person. Viruses tend to sweep through a population and hes heard no mention of it being beyond a single person, so it'd be a safe play to assume its bacterial in nature.",2
458,It's the easiest thing to directly treat if you know about it and the chance of some secondary bacterial infection coming in whilst her immune system is weakened is pretty high in a world with little to no knowledge of medicine or hygiene.,2
459,"it's a pretty decent guess, given the zero information he has to work with. Plus even if it's not  her  problem, antibiotics are still one of the biggest medical advances out there, especially if you limit your scope to things you don't already need large amounts of scientific infrastructure to create. The other big one is sanitation, but that's not nearly as much of a problem when you're still in a small village where injuries that require surgery are few and far between.",2
460,"It's implied they talked off-screen     ""Didn't you say you could heal her?""",2
461,Maybe she’s got cancer.,2
462,"More likely some congenital disorder.  Chrome became a ""sorcerer"" to save her, which means she's been suffering from this for at least as many years as he's been sorcering.  If it was cancer, she'd've died by now.",2

Tsukasa may kill the individual, but he cannot kill human nature.    Even if he miraculously managed to create his commie tribe, he will eventually die and curious people like Chrome will keep appearing, advancing society.",2
467,"That was a great moments and just kinda shows, even if he does kill Senku and Chrome, there will still be some idiot willing to go beyond his comfort zone. It's just a fact that Tsukasa is not willing to think about.",1
468, As the saying goes...         rum ,2
469,"Maybe he doesn't really care to think forward - like many leaders, he wants to make the world as he wants right now and benefit during his lifetime - so what if it sets everyone back. Unfortunately, there are many ideologies that aim to make things ""good"" and then stick to that. If you want to make things better and as such rock the boat  most importantly in terms of social order , get out!",2
470,True.,1
471,"I read a really interesting opinion just two days ago or so. It was basically about how civilization is progress, and what did work for previous generations and made them prosper  military service, insurances, whatever  might not work for the current generation, since times and the world are changing. And that's why people need to change, too. And how we do things. It's why the ""back in my day, I worked a lot and was able to just study and buy a house, so you should be too if you weren't so lazy""-mentality fails so incredibly hard. The tricky part is to figure out what might be universally true, or at least long-term.    Anime oversimplifications aside, I really do believe that forcibly trying to keep the status quo is the wrong move.",1
472,"My take is that he is completely willing to think about that and what will happen, and that's why he is so cold about it.        He seems to wish complete control upon the future of humans as a benevolent savior ready to do anything he needs to protect his utopia, so he probably already plans to kill anyone who shows interest in producing real scientifical results.     The question is if someone like Chrome would be considered indeed a scientist or just a random dude doing silly things unlike the manly hunters who deserve respect because they are manly men and providing food.    Outright killing him would be probably not that useful unless he wants to establish some kind of religious order of warriors that in the future will stop human curiosity as he would do.     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND that's how he we get a totalitarian religion that burns witches and wizards.",2

499,"Well, yeah. The issue is mostly reddit. Yeah, but that's normal they've never heard it, I'm actually not really surprised to be honest.",1
500,"You are sarcastic but communist regimes haven't been very fond of scholars in the past, Mao and the Khmer Rouge aimed their hatred towards scholars explicitly for the goal of a perfect communist state, since they were seen a class above the farmers, and  Castro started a witch-hunt to writers that spread what he considered dangerous texts.     Kind of like Tsukasa wanting to eliminate Senku's dangerous knowledge.",2
501,     Worth mentioning though that the Communist NVA and the Soviet Union backers waged war against them to stop that.,2
502,"     That's a contradiction in terms.    This is a very important bit that a lot of people get wrong. Communism as an ideology is by definition stateless and classless. There is no regime because everyone has equal social standing. Nobody has the authority to order anyone else around.    There are countries that tried to reach communism through marxist-leninist theory, where a small vanguard party grabs control  of the state and uses its power to move the country to communism. This has almost always failed right after the ""give the vanguard party near monopoly rule and hope they give up their power"" step.     But it also means that while those countries might call themselves communist and or socialist, in reality they are just a dictatorship. Usually called state-capitalism in socialist theory  since the workers still don't have control, its just that the boss has changed from the unaccountable capitalist to an unaccountable party official . It's kinda like a 'Democratic' 'Republic' of North Korea situation: they say they are one thing, but in reality they really aren't.    So when you are talking about a historical communist country, keep in mind that that's not the same as an actual implementation of communist ideology. Just a particular failure mode of a particular strain of thought that has largely been discredited within larger socialist theory.    Tsukasa is closer to a primitivist wanna be warlord  since he's the strongest  than he is to a communist.",2
503,"I can't believe this has gotten downvotes, this is a great post!",1
504,"Tsukasa wants an applied communism state and in his mind he took the first step by killing the world only scholar, so the theory you mention is pretty irrelevant to him.         He said he wanted to stop ownership of resources  because of the beach seashell incident  and vehemently opposes to the ""old rich people"" existing, explicitly because they will bring the concept of owning stuff and money back.    Seems like every communist movement on history in it's early days.    The village is a great example of primitivism, they own stuff but are primitive  even if unwillingly , what Tsukasa advocates is against owning things.",1
505,"Sure, he talks about abolishing wealth and stuff. But the important bit here is that he ALSO talks about a world where the strong rule. The former part sure as hell is communist, but the latter part completely invalidates it.    You know how both liberal capitalist democracy and socialism talk about freedom, but have very different interpertations of what that freedom actually entails? Capitalists will tell you that you are free, but then require you to spend 8 hours a day working for an undemocratic overlord or risk being deprived of your primary needs. To a socialist that's not freedom at all. Same kinda deal here. He talks about a world without money and ownership, but then he interprets that as ""The strong get to rule"".    And yea, the village is much closer to primitive technology than whatever Tsukasa cooked up. But note that they still have a clergy  priestress girl  and presumably a chieftain. So they probably aren't completely communist since there are still distinct classes in society.",2
506,"HOLY SHIT, someone that actually knows what theyre talking about    THANK YOU    It's so damn infuriating talking about socialism and someone going ""well do you know how many deaths communism has caused!?!?""",1
507,"Yea, the cold war propaganda runs deep... The moment you say anything about it, people's brains just turn off.  Artist impression of the average redditor reading the word communist.     It's silly as shit, not to mention harmful.",1
508,"Hunting down opposition is hardly a ""communist"" vision, you can find that in pretty much any capitalist nation. Cuba and the soviet union have had incredible respect for education, huge focus on science and high level of both men and women in stem research.    Thinking that science has anything to do with capital is such a weird thing to think i don't know how to even respond to it.",1
509,"the guy you're replying to defends communism like the lapdog he is wherever I see him pop up, oh the wonders of RES.",1
510,Can you actually respond to that guy and tell them   why   you think they're wrong rather than just calling out the very fact that they have a position they commonly defend as if that's somehow supposed to debunk their logic?,0
511,"I can, but I will not. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to point out to chapos why their ideology falls apart in reality you’d understand how futile the effort is. No amount of historical evidence of philosophical arguments work, because everything tried ‘isn’t real communism’. It’s almost like these fools have not even read the manifesto their ideology stems from, how can I argue against a position they don’t even understand they hold?    Also, if anybody does not understand the dangers of this ideology by the time they get out of high-school with a western education them their education system has failed them. We manage to make most people understand why nazi ideology is not to be repeated, but somehow the experiments in the east and the deathtolls seen there under these systems is easily brushed aside. No, I shall debate this with any commie who doesn’t first show a willingness to alter their position if presented with arguments they can’t defend against.",0
512,"There are primitivists who want humanity to go back to a stage of civilization where we lived in basically communist tribes, before the dawn of agriculture.    You're right though. People in communist organizations like the Venus project think communism is pro-science. Marx thought science just progressed inevitably, and that this technological progress would bring about a communist, post-scarce Utopia at some point.    But the point is, it's completely accurate to say Tsukasa wants a primitivist, communist world where we lived in tribes in populations under Dunbar's number. There's a funny meme that describes this well. It shows a primitivist following a communist around. The communist asks why the primitivist is following him. The primitivist answers that communism is the fastest way to decimate the world population and bring us back to a tribal ""post-scarce"" society. The communist tells the primitivist to f off. Whether the primitivists are right or not is a discussion for a different subreddit.",1
513,"Tsukasa i don't believe specifically cares about science. He just does not the world before the stone world to ""reawaken"" Senku being the only  known  man on earth capable of doing this. As he can revive people given the proper materials. And was probably a day or two away from properly developing a pipegun or musket.    To Tsukasa as long as the ""cancer of the old world"" doesn't awaken again. He could care less what happens to the world. If Senku abandoned the idea of rebuilding the old world  and resurrecting the people Tsukasa thought were the cause of the petrification  then he would have allowed Senku to go about his business.",2

516,"     For big part of human history people didn't knew of microbes.     Before 1665 people didn't knew microorganism existed.     Since modern humans have existed for 200,000 years...this means we spent 198,335 years without knowing of microbes.    The village people seem to have discovered how to preserve food  the drying of the fishes  and basic pottery textile crafting making them effectively a primitive society.",2

518,"More like communication technology has been accelerating, and we're able to get more like minds together on narrow topics. Used to be that someone in a random nation state noticed something and it would take months or years for this information to slowly leak to the rest of the world. Now not only has the internet reduced information travel time, translation technology often results in scientific papers being from people working anywhere on Earth. If you think things are insane now, wait ten or twenty more years for when typed and perhaps even spoken machine translation is seamless.",2
519,"The idea is that if they are descendants, shouldn't they at least have understanding of some basics even if nobody has the technical know how of building fighter jets. You know simple chemistry, biology and physic knowledge at the very least which the village don't seems to be displaying.",2
520,"Remember the village was originally founded by people who woke up from stone. They must've had at least some basic knowledge like making pottery and food preparation, and passed it on to their kids. Heck they can speak Japanese with Senku. Why they didn't pass down  everything  about the previous society? Dunno, maybe they didn't deem it important or didn't know enough. Also they're probably occupied enough trying to survive daily",2
521,     The first human observation of microbes was in the 17th century using telescopes but there are much much more ancient human texts that speculated on the potential existence of such things.    It certainly wasn’t common knowledge until the latter part of the 20th century.,2

524,"That only applies if those from the village are actually NOT descendants of the modern human population that got unpetrified right?    Otherwise these ancestor should be easily able to explain about microbe because I am pretty sure every human in jp from senku's time understand that. Especially if preserving of food knowledge is passed down rather then a ""rediscovery"" by those descendants.",2

It's Karmawhores who post comments and want to make it more likely for their comment to end up as the top upvoted comment. The most upvoted comment is usually the one that gains the most upvotes early on so that people coming to see early discussion upvote that comment even more until it snowballs and ends up the top comment due to its higher visibility at the top of the page.     Downvoting everybody else makes it more likely that your comment ends up winning the early rush for upvotes.  TL:DR - Its vote manipulation.",1

I feel that with minor tweeking it couuld serve to be the first episode honestly, because these characters are above and beyond more interesting. But at the same time, I am so hyped for everything that is developing in the background so far and I am just as invested in that. It's just a shame that the first couple of episodes weren't as much of a hook as this one because I found it hard to recommend this series previously.

However, I'm a bit disappointed with how Crunchyroll translated his catchphrase. If you're listening to the voice acting, you'll notice that Chrome says ""yabee"" a lot. This is a Japanese slang word with a lot of different meanings. In the manga, this is translated as ""bad""  meaning either ""not good"" or ""bad ass"" , but Crunchyroll has given it a different translation based on the context  ""oh crap,"" ""awesome,"" etc . This solution works, but the catchphrase gets lost in translation as a result. Like, what would Crunchyroll do if another character points out his catchphrase? Well, I suppose there isn't always a perfect solution when translating such a different language, and I appreciate the quality on the translation in general.",1
642,"One weird thing about this episode is that Kohaku says forty in english  about the number of villagers , but Senku repeats yonjuuni and the subtitles say 40 so some weird dissonance happening here. I believe the manga says 42 so Senku's intelligence transcends reality.",1
643,"Senku doesn’t actually say anything in the manga, it just cuts to the double spread page with the names and faces of all of the villagers. I think they added the line to emphasize that Kohaku counts in English and also because many Japanese kids watching won’t understand the English numbers.",0
644,     That's because Senku says 'yonjuu-nin'  四十人  not 'yonjuuni'  四十二 .,1
645,"Well that would make sense, I just probably can't hear the ん because of my lack of experience in japanese.",2
646,"Like you said, it has a lot of meanings which means one translation cannot be a catch-all. Other characters use it too  I'm pretty sure our carbonation boy will use it a lot  so it wont be unique to Chrome.",1
647,"Up until this episode I was majorly on the fence about this anime. It felt real fast. Nothing was really happening per say.

648,1st Arc is considered slow and the weakest. It only gets better from this point. The anime had conveyed well the emotion of Chrome learning about humanity,1

He's such a good boy.    I also got goosebumps when he explained the world before the petrification. You can almost imagine watching a show from Chrome's perspective, where he survives in a stone age civilization. This would be like the Season 3 finale where he finally learns the truth of the world and it changes everything. Essentially Attack on Titan.",1

674,"To be fair, if you'd be the only human left on the planet, how much scientific knowledge could you remember? How to build a house? Agriculture? Electricity? Medicine? Tools weapons?    I'm guessing 99,9% of humankind would be down to actual stone-age level.",2
675,Remember? Most people never even knew.    The average person's knowledge of modern society is how to use devices other people made or take care of medical issues by just taking something prescribed. Take that away the people with specialised knowledge and they'd be in a worse state than a primitive society.,2
676,"I'd be able to reinvent binary and logic gates.    So, um, I'll be one of the first to starve to death.",2
677,"Oh I am not taking about them bringing back all the tech and stuff. It is just that going by chrome action, it is obvious he is ""rediscovering"" the periodic table. Another example is that in our modern age, we understand microbe and its importance to survivability yet the village seems clueless doesn't necessary means they need to have the ability to treat it, but just knowing about it .",2
678,"At this point, we only know as much as Senku.",1
679,"It didn't plummet to zero. They speak perfect Japanese, with a lot of English loan words and have  real life modern day mannerisms. Evolution doesn't quite work that conveniently. Or fast for that matter, it's only been 3700 years.     Your money should be either on ""descendants of people that were unpetrified generations ago"" or ""descendants of people that were never petrified in the first place"". Those are the most logical possibilities.",2
680,     Wouldn't thousands of years result in language drift if that was the case?,2
681,What changes would happen to a civilization that would never have any outside influence?,2
682,we wouldn't even understand people from 500 years ago ...,2
683,That's probably because how much cultures mixed. But here there are no different cultures.,2
684,"If you wanna be spoiled, go read the manga.",2
685,"I can tell you right now: 3700 years is not enough for a new human-like species to evolve.    As for their actual origin, that would be spoiler territory so that is more appropriate in the source material corner.",2
686,Ah ok good enough for me. So there is an explanation for their lack of understanding.,1
687,"but the language would be vastly different. try to read something from 300-500 years ago, you almost can't understand it because it's a different kind of English.",2
688,"But is that as a function of time or as a function of cultural shift and societal change? This village doesn't seem to have progressed much beyond hunter gatherer stage, so if it is that shift or change mentioned it might just not have occurred no matter how long this village has been around. It is just one of those things we can't really test to know its origin for sure.    But ultimately it is probably just a convenience to not have to go through the process of learning to communicate.    How was your comment relevant to what I said to begin with btw? My comment was just about the possibility of evolution of a new species even before the matter of language.",2
689,"     There is no way that:     ;    A  Something evolved into a spcies  exactly  like humans.    B  They  just  happen to speak japanese.    C  Something evolved into a new species in just 3 thousand years.     ;    So no, definitely not a ""new evolution"".",2
690,"Fair enough. But I was making the comment under the assumption of ""fantasy"" since the footnote at the end only mentioned whatever senku science offer are actual science. The story plot need not be.    After all global petrifaction and only on human and swallow? Plus undoing that actually heals a human enough that senku having his nerve snap can come back to life. So these are indeed fantasy settings. Oh and also tsukasa will never beat a pride of lion bare handed in real life anyway no matter how much a human train.",1
691,"Even if it's not completely realistic it doesn't mean the story will completely divorce itself from reality.     ;         Actually, there is a theory that explains this and is  more or less  real life complying. Of course not 100% realistic but fiction never is.     ;         Well, yes. This is one of those  relatively  small breaks from reality.",1
692,It's a Planet of the Apes thing.,2
693,Tsukasa is quaking,1
694,"There was so much meme material in this episode LMAO    Hopefully Ruri gets healed next episode, she looks like a really nice sister.",1
695,Next episode.. pfffff   ,1
696,Yeah got tired of waiting so I'm reading the manga lol,1
697,Read it and you'll notice you've made a miscalculation...,2
698,Best ep yet,1
699,Damn do I really have to wait another week now?,2
700,"Go read the manga, it starts at chapter 20",2
701,That puppy in the flashback though! That was dark as  fuck !,0
702,Aww. Senku made a friend. That's nice.,1
703,They are gonna make antibiotics?      Alexander Fleming would be proud. Though this time it won't be accidental I guess.,1
704,Me seeing the village with 40 people.    Cotton matte,2
705,"I just hope that if this series expands beyond 1 season that they release quicker then most mainstream animes.    I really am loving it right now, quite unique in most aspects. I personally find it refreshing and new.",1
706,"So now we are gonna say a big ""fuck you"" to pure chemistry and we start to do some good ol' microbiology?         Damn boy, society is going on quite fast indeed.",1
707,Kohaku = Tsundere,2
708,She is neither Tsun nor dere. She is gorilla.,2
709,Wait I'm confused. Where did this village come from? Does first generation just mean they were the first to wake up from the stone? And if that were the case how did they know nothing about the stone people or technology? Something like that would have had to been passed down through generations.,2
710,"dont worry, itll get all explained later.",2
711,Okay but Senku is saying first-generation like I should know what that means,2
712,"First-generation would be people who were alive before the petrification and were later revived.        Second-generation would be people born in the stone world, descendants of the first generation.",2
713,Thank you,1
714,"This show is all i watch nowadays, it’s sooo good!!",1
715,I feel like the arc is going to be very intresting and different from four character just having conflict,1
716,"Shit, Chrome might actually surpass Taiju as best bro, and he managed to do that in a single episode! Now we've got the science bros!",1
717,Shout out to Dr Stone for helping me understand the science behind one of the characters from Land of the Lustrous.,1
718,I binged 7 episodes today. And now I started the manga. I need more of this series.,1
719,"Anyone else feel like so much happened in this episode and yet so little? Anyway, Chrome is probably my favorite character from the Stone World so far.",1
720,Bruuuh Senkus face has me dying,1
721,"Alright guys, I'm reading the manga, can't wait to see the medicine.",1
722,"Antibiotics in a world where the resistant germs are probably gone.    Ah... the days of drastically improving the life expectancy of people will return.    Chrome being a man of science, who knew nothing of the old world, is a great character.    Senku is right. Even if he falls, people will find a way.",1
723,"Kohaku lied that her extra trip time was because she decided to dick around. But as soon as the inner guards talk to the outer guards, she’ll be busted about the stray she took home. Wonder why she took that tact.",2
724,She probably just didn't want to worry her sister.,2
725,She'd probably get in shit if she was honest about getting stuck under that tree.,2
726,"Also this has been the best episode so far , hope they stick with the village arc for a bit and not make a whole episode about Tsukasa , Taiju and Yuzuriha meeting again because the last couple episodes were meh",1
727,"Easily my favorite episode so far. This series has never been among my favorites, I mean, the previous episodes were entertaining and I liked them but I definitely hadn't enjoyed them as much as this one. Kohaku is great!",1
728,"Is it just me or does chrome look like Taiju , my guess one of the first people to build the village might have been relative of Taiju.",1
729,"Finally, now this anime is starting to get REALLY good! Also, fuck yeah, we finally saw a glimpse of the loli  Suika!  I look forward to seeing more of her!",1
730,This show just got so much more interesting,1
731,"Her mouth says no, but her uncanny eyes says she's ready to repopulate the world with Senku's science children.",1
732,"Yah, Chrome!    How does Senku know that Ruri is suffering from a bacterial infection? Antibiotics would be useless against anything else.",2
733,"Yah, but what else should it be? If its a Virus, there is not ""much"" he can do, or it could be a parasyte, but i assume that wouldve killed her already. Creating Penicillin  i assume  doesnt take too long and covers a shit load of illnesses.",2
734,It' time for an episode of Dr. Senku's amazing medical know how!,1
735,"Yes, creating penicillin is a good move, but he seems way too certain that it will work.  Could be parasytes - not sure why you think those are always quickly fatal, could be a congenital condition, could be some trauma that caused long lasting damage, could be tons of other things my non-medical mind can't think of.",1
736,i honestly am really curious what the Bacteria to Virus ect. infection ratio was back in a time like theirs.,1
737,Back in a time 3700 years in the future? :P    There are no vaccines so that's one thing that's bad.,2
738,AntiVaxxers are the responsible behind the petrification?,2
739,Could be. But if you can't fix it why worry about it? Bacterial infection seems like a good guess and the easier one to treat.,1
740,"And even useless against many bacteria, not all antibiotics have a wide area of effect!     Still, it's a good idea.     I mean, deal with viral infection is complex in general so you should start checking for common bacteria or simply some other kind of secondary damage derived from a previous infection.    Given this fact, there is also the detail that viruses are... strange things.    Some evolves a lot  Flu  some doesn't evolve at all  Measles  so dealing with them would imply some tests, while bacteria would probably be a far less problematic thing to deal with.",1
741,"I mean even if he doesn't know what it is, creating antibiotics is probably the best option because there is a decent chance that it is a bacterial virus.",1
742,     A what now?,2
743,"This episode felt kinda slow to me. I like the show overall but it feels like it runs at 80% speed. The conversations monologues just feel kinda long and drawn out sometimes.    It was a bit frustrating that Senku wasn't questioning these people more about what they know or how they came to be there. With how knowledge driven he is it seemed a bit out of character. Yea he assumed this civilization sprung up from a different generation but I would have liked to seen him ask what they though about the stone statues, what their history is, how their society works, etc. Hopefully we'll get to that in the future episodes.    I like Chrome so far and Senku having an apprentice like sidekick is pretty nice. Adding a primitive civilization is a good way for Senku to show off all kinds of neat inventions. The primitive people reacting to modern science is a cool aspect I'm looking forward to!",1
744,"     They are primitive so of course in case they even know anything, they probably don't understand it themselves. Plus Senkuu knows he has time, why should he ask important things before he even got their trust. That would just make him look shady if he tried to get information out of them.",1
745,He doesn't really care about anything other than TL.,2
746,If Senku doesn't ask it means he probably figured out already.,2
747,"He's a scientist, not an anthropologist.",2
748,Wait wasn‘t penicillin better than Antibioticum?,2
749,Antibiotic refers to any medication that kill bacteria. Penicillin is a type of antibiotic derived from the mold penicillium and was the first good antibiotic that was discovered.,2
750,I imagine pencilin will be part of it,2
751,Penicillin is an antibiotic and really easy to produce; just let fruit go bad and harvest the mold.,2
752,"Guess Reina Ueda is voicing another character this season, first Gray and now Ruri, bless her soothing voice.    Chrome hearing about everything from the old world must have been mindblowing!     Edit: I'm liking this character.",1
753,Best Gorilla,1
754,damn loving this new arc so far and it just started. HYPERS.    the comedy this episode was also just perfect imo,1
755,Less Tsukasa and more everything else. Top episode,1
756,Chrome being JoJo posing is hilarious LMAO,1
757,Why do these posts get gilded?,2
758,"So Ayla sleeps with knives. Good habit to have in this stone world.             Yes. I mean that's usually how this kinda thing works out anyways. Your pretty smart Senku I'd figure you'd figure that. So perhaps for your future benefit you should make some dumbbells out of rocks or something to lift in your down time.      Yeah Senku may need to work out the kinks in his Flintstone mobile.      Well that an impressive village Ayla has there  que the music: So this Chrome guy uses hits flair for performance and in this case pretty decent scientific knowledge pull the wool over on these ignorant masses. He reminds me of Oz from Wizard of Oz, they're both charlatans but both are good people at heart. Hell I may start addressing Chrome as Oz from now on, seems fitting enough, right?      But anyways its good to see that Senku has a new friend and ally in science who shares his passion  and a lab already set up to boot . And I can only wonder how Oz will react to the prospect of revival fluid and bringing people back from petrification and what impact it may have on the village.",2
759,Why are you calling Kohaku Alya?,2
760,Because from the get go she reminded me of Ayla from Chrono Trigger and I've just kinda decided to roll with it. Like how I address Tsukasa as Kraven  Spider-Man  and now Chrome as Oz. I didn't plan it out or anything it just kinda happened cuz it's fun.      I think I explained this to someone else last week too.,1
761,"It's hilarious how they are downvoting you just because you are making a joke out of a character's appearance. Like Tsukasa and that guy from Jojo  haven't watched Jojo yet, so I don't know his name .",1
762,Kars,2
763,"Well I don't know anything about Jojo either. Never watched it, don't care to or want to watch it.      As for the downvoting who knows. When Tsukasa first appeared and I first likened him to Kraven or last week when I likened Kohaku to Ayla people seemed to have no issue with it. But all I can hope to do is speak my piece whether that piece be funny, serious, or philosophical, in this case funny, and hope that I made someone laugh or think.",1
764,Kohaku’s eyes give me flashbacks...,2

Another related fact I learned recently is that ancient Nerubians, around 0 BC, seems to have been  drinking beer containing tetracycline  which is one of the most advanced antibiotics we have and it's one of the few still effective against MRSA.",2
769,"Yeah, the science wasn't in  discovering  penicillin, it was in figuring out how to produce and use it efficiently. It was in saying ""this does a weird thing. . . but  why?"" ",2
770,So if they have a rule to ban all outside people they must have had some bad incidents in the past          Curious what kinda people are running around out there and what other tribes exist,2
771,Didn't they specifically say that there are no other people and that everyone outside had been banished?,2
772,"Okay, so Senkuu seems to think the same way I do. Hundreds of years ago people un-petrified and then these new people we just met are a few generations after that.    The main question is, why don't they know anything about science? The people who did un-petrify awhile back should have known about the old civilization, so why isn't that information passed down.    Also, there was a chance that perhaps some people were never petrified at all and these people were descendants of them. Either way is fine, i just hope they give us a ""canon"" answer on what happened with these people and explain why they have a lack of science or knowledge of the old world.    I actually really like Chrome! Thought he would be annoying, but seems like a good dude who loves science like Senkuu!",1
773,"Think about the average person, do they know the underlying mechanics behind every technology they live. Probably not.",2
774,"True, but you probably would at least past down things like: huge buildings, planes, ways to travel insanely fast.    Judging from Chrome’s reaction, he knew nothing of this sort. So it is a little confusing why they know nothing at all about the old civilization.",2
775,"Oral knowledge only last so long before being distorted. PLus I'm pretty sure Senku was very thorough when explaining that stuff, while what the others may know from what was passed from generation to generation may not be as clear.",2
776,"Beyond the fact that oral histories can easily distort, keep in mind that there are probably far more useful pieces of knowledge to pass down to people in this type of world than knowledge about what the world was once like which doesn't really help them much",2
777,What chapters did this episode cover,2
778,Episode ended at the end of chapter 19,2
779,Pog,1
780,Ok so I’m not gonna lie I got hella confused watching the start of the episode cause I didn’t realized I didn’t finish the part of episode 6 where he meets the lion girl and ended the episode cause I thought it ended well little did I know there was more plot to it,2
781,I can say that 2019 is the best year for anime in a while,1
782,Without that bullshit interaction between the MC s  and Tsukasa it is actually a very entertaining show.,1
783,Everything will be further explained. Either just enjoy the anime or binge the manga in 3 days,1
784,"2 Is a question that will never be answered. It's a manga and it's focus is on science, not linguistics.",2
785,"These questions will likely be answered by the end of the season, but not right away.",2

807,That is not the voice I was expecting for Ginro at all.,1
808,I always get chills from this but today I definitely wish that my memories about this story can be erased so I could feel like the first time again.  It's too good and I can't wait to see more ️,1
809,I stopped reading the manga around chapter 60. Does it pick up? I kind of got bored after a while even though I enjoyed it mostly.,0

826,Where can i watch it?,2
827,Direct link: ,2
828,  Senku   vs   Kohaku   = comedy gold!,1
829,I’m liking the anime. But I think it’s getting pretty dry. Just everything feels dragged except for the 1 or 2 times there is actual plot points. But other than that I think it’s dope now that senku has an actual person who wants to learn science.,0
830,"Keep up with it, you won't be disappointed. Things only get better from here on out.",1
831,"I feel like I’m forcing myself to watch but hopefully. It does. Cause I hate dry, dragging anime’s.",0
832,It doesn't. It's going to get much better in the next few episodes alone. The village arc is one most of us manga readers all agree is where the real story begins. Everything prior was the prologue.,1
833,"I've hated this show up until this episode. It feels like its finally hitting its stride, although its still pretty low on my seasonal list. Glad I kept at it though.",1
834,"Yeah the first arc is by far the worst as Taiju and Yuzuriha are just very bland characters. The new power trio of Senkuu, Chrome and Kohaku are more entertaining before even accounting for side characters",1
835,"""Dr. Stone prescribes antibiotics to a patient he hasn't even met.""  Always Sunny Music Plays     Also, this episode made me realize something: Senku has basically done no real science. He's just applying random science facts he remembers. This kid from the village has done more science than him without even knowing it.",0
836,How do you think he came up with the petrification cure? That was science.,2
837," Jesus Christ Marie, they're minerals! ",2
838, Senku just achivied the stereotype weeabos nerd dream ,2
839,pretty annoying ep tbh.,0
840,Well it would be to primitive people who think you're a wacko.,2
841,What gave you that impression though?,2
842,"How do you reach that conclusion from that?    Earlier in the episode you get a cart made out of the pulleys used for raising the tree to free Kohaku. It's an indirect result of science used elsewhere.    And remember Senku already knows everything modern. We don't have foresight, when doing basic science we may not know where the results will be. But Senku can skip past that and apply modern knowledge. Of course if someone is sick in a stone age society he would try to develop antibiotics.     Even if you run with the Old Social Contract of Science, that's linear and goes from basic science to applied science, then to engineering and then benefits society, results aren't immediate, but you don't need to rediscover penicillin for every sick patient.",0
