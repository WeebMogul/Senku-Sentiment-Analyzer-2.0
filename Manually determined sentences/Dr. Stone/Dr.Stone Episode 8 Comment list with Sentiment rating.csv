20,What kind of scientist wouldn't repurpose perfectly good intact materials?,2

39,"so...as a dm gm keeper gamespecific running person, not a game designer, how can you communicate such a chain of events being better than the stabby stabby or shooty shooty option?  just set the thresholds for that so low that when someone entertains the idea of not murderhoboing they win? cause so many players want to be tsukasa with senku energy",2
40,"As a disclaimer I'm neither a DM nor a game designer  though I watch a lot of game design youtube videos , but maybe you could make the opposing forces physically powerful to disincentivize straightforward battles? Or something else in the game lore makes that not an option, unique culture with its unique taboos and stigmas, for example. Or a third-party arbiter that'd whoop your ass.     Then again, refer to the disclaimer, I'm talking without much experience XD",2
41,"For murderhoboin, make it so they actions have consequences. Your adventurers aren't the only tough guys around, and the world is filled with big wigs.    If they burn down a church killing all the worshippers in progress, have them regret it it  but in a fun way  have the Kingdom send its finest Paladins, lvl 20 tough guys who have the full resources of the Kingdom under their command. That church didn't exist in a vacuum, have the God of the church be angry at such crimes that befell his loyal worshippers came to seek his help, but not in a direct way, have him give the Paladins extra blessings to hunt the fiends.    If they assassinate the king, have the Kingdom commit everything it has to their pursuit, have all the Royal guards after their tail, checking every town and tavern, creating checkpoints in every road. Alternatively this the opportunity for an unexpected plotline, maybe have the assassination if the king the catalyst for a succession crisis, with a faction loyal to king's rightful heir and a faction loyal to an usurper, with the Usurper faction willing to cooperate with the murders, but still way of them, they aren't too be trusted of course. Of course the heir's faction is still after their heads.    Instead of having them fighting the big bads to save the world, have them aim for survival. If they do extra crazy stuff, have them become infamous everywhere, wanted in every Kingdom.    It's worth noting they I have never DMd, not have I ever played D&D, I only have a desire to play, but alas, no one in my friends even cares, and the closets adventurer's league is countries away.",2
42,Oh wait til you see the boss they have to face.,1
43,"It absolutely is and I love it. This show isn't super overt about the influence games have on it but there's certain bits like the ""Start quest!"" on his road map, the little 8 bit sounds Suika made as she rolled over the bridge, the multiple mentions of Dragon Quest, and the little ""xxx acquired!"" text boxes that pop up that really indicate the influence video games have on it. That and the fact that the entire plot structure is, as you said, very video game-esque.",1
44,"I also love how in those parts they mention some video games like Monster Hunter. They totally give a fun vibe, the show is partially a comedy after all so it fits in perfectly",1
45,"Also,  ""when Mario eats mushrooms, he's totally hallucinating, man..."" ",1
46,And people say it's not an Isekai.,2
47,"I mean, it's not in any meaningful capacity. Just because it's inspired by video games and is effectively ""another world""  which it still technically isn't  doesn't make it an isekai, especially since it doesn't adhere to any of the other tropes that are building blocks of the subgenre. It doesn't fit in the isekai box any more than say Saga of Tanya the Evil, which is even more literally an isekai while also not conforming to genre tropes in any meaningful capacity.",2
48,"I know, I know, it's just fun to draw the connection when the show does more Isekai-like stuff",1
49,"It's a craft tree, this is where you really start realising Dr. Stone is basically the anime version of those survival crafting games like Don't Starve.",2
50,Holy shit senku is basically anime wilson,1
51,"I mean... Those games are just based on real life crafting anyways.    To make a thing, you need things, and to make those things you need other things, so on and so fourth.",2
52,"True, but IRL, it's a bit unfeasible for a single person to go from sticks and stones to complex machinery built with iron smelted from minerals with a furnace made with clay bricks and powered by coal... all mined by them. Instead that's exactly what happens in those games, and Dr. Stone is close to that too, though it does put more of a focus on teamwork.",2
53,"The most unfeasible thing is really just your environment. In Dr Stone they have and I expect them to continue to just conveniently have the materials they need in easy reach and being easy to find.    And how they seem to be able to do sometimes way too much work conveniently offscreen.    The ""tech-tree"" thing makes sense. It's just they magically only have to deal with bad luck if it's plot relevant and can work super-humanly fast when the camera isn't looking at them lol.",1
54,"     Yeah, that was my point. They both work amazingly fast and have almost everything work perfectly at their first attempt, even if it's just rudimentary rigged-up contraptions based on crude designs. The further you go into the manga, the more noticeable that gets, culminating in stuff like  ""the mice-shaped RC cars used to carry messages across distances and terrains that would give even modern ones a hard time"" .",1
55,"They do at least mention things like having say three options in how to go about something and two being unfeasible due to lack of tech resources, like when he tries to make antibiotics and can't just rely on random chance to make penicillin, so he needs the iron.",2
56,"Sure, the show is handling it fairly well and isn't being egregious with the plot armour. But it's still making things a lot easier for the characters than in real life.",1
57,"Of course, thats probably just for plot convenience since the show isn't super bleak. I just enjoy that they think about alternate routes and what works better rather than asspulling the one solution every time.",1
58,Anime Factorio.,2
59,"Senku got interest in her, not because of her beauty  He did not saw her until now , he is interest in her Wisdom. She is right now some kind of High-Priest in the Ancient past. Guardians of knowledge  but also exploit of it     Just check up our own History about church teaching the ""poor"" in the middle age times. I bet all around the world was nearly the same",2
60,Yeah guessing she found some kind of working cache of knowledge from back then and is using it to educate  but also power .,2
61,"Yeah, he just needs to do  One Small Favour  to get their help.",2
62,"And getting the iron is just part 1 of making the antibiotics, this is gonna be one of those side quests that the devs made ridiculously long and tedious for shits and giggles.",1
63,"I feel like that's the ""point"" of the Dragon-Quest styled status updates on what Senku has acquired or progressed towards.",2
64,This whole arc is a series of questlines and I love it lol,1
65,Great now I want both a Made in Abyss video game and a Dr Stone video game.,1
66,Pretty sure ive seen 90% of this episode on Primitive Technology. Thats neat.,1
67,"Even ramen? Damn, i want the sauce.",1
68,Your flair seems a bit fishy,2
69,He likes them young.  Just like tsukasa,2
70,What do you mean?,2
71, Nothing special..   hellopolice ,2
72,oh no,2
73,Hmm?  Reads his flair  Oh......,2
74,"its double entrende. Could mean something that results in FBI OPEN UP! or a predator from ALIEN, but loli-version.",2
75," He made pancakes.  I seem to remember him making noodles, but I might be mistaken.",2
76,"Like he said, the pancakes have the texture of rice noodles. All that needs to change is the shape.",2
77,not just the pancakes but he has many videos making iron pellets from iron bacteria.,2
78,"Yeah, there are some interesting ways of getting iron, like bog iron.",2
79,That works too,1
80,I hate to say it but my enjoyment of the show went up 10 billion percent after it started focusing on Senku's solo shenanigans. Feels like an entirely different season somehow,1
81,Isn't it just huts and clay pots now?,2
82,"He's tried to make iron from iron producing bacteria and gotten a little bit, but nothing he could really work with",2
83,I thought they had a heavy water nuclear reactor now?,2
84,And sandals he never wore again,2
85,Lowkey disappointed Senku didn't try burning twigs into charcoal.,0
86,Charcoal is just really dried out wood. It still wouldn’t get to the heat necessary for smelting iron like they need without some way to stoke the fire harder than what they’ve currently got.,2
87,"That combined  with a forge and leave blower per person, though... ",2
88,"Nah. That setup was only good enough to get tiny, unusable metal pellets of junk-iron. They’re going to need to manufacture much larger quantities of much higher quality stuff. Scaling the entire operation up several magnitudes to accommodate that means they’d need a lot more manpower, even with fancy blowing gadgets to stoke the flames.",2
89,Fair enough. I don't know a whole lot about this anyway.,1
90,"     Not exactly.  Charcoal is almost completely composed of pure carbon, whereas very dry wood, let's say 0% humidity still contains organic compounds and a trace amount of a bunch of other stuff.  You'll notice that a charcoal fire is relatively smoke-less compared to a wood-fire.  This is indicative of a more complete combustion reaction occurring, meaning more atoms are forming new bonds and thus releasing more energy.",2
91,Oh! He's going to make BREAD.          What.    Edit: I love that Senku learned the reason his navigation thing wasn't working a few episodes ago is because the north star moved. Everything that doesn't make work in this anime has a reason for it and that's awesome.,1
92,"Don't most breads require yeast and a clean oven? Well maybe tortilla or naan types, but you just have to boil noodles.",2
93,"Yes, but wild yeast is pretty much everywhere. You can make a batch with some flour and water. Here, you can try it yourself:    1. Mix equal parts flour and water.  1. Pour it into something very clean and cover it with a cloth.  1. Leave it somewhere shady and cool.  1. Every day, pour in some more flour and water.  1. Keep doing this for like 2 weeks. If it's bubbly, you're doing good.    You now have wild yeast starter. It's not gonna be the world's best sourdough, but it'll make surprisingly good bread.",1
94,I mean you would expect someone living in Japan to be more confident in making ramen than bread .,2
95,bread is super popular in japan. Bread in one form or another is a human cultural constant for the last several millennia,1
96,"Yeah but you can make an entire feast with ramen, bread is nice and all but i'd kill for some noodles right now",2
97,"No, not really. Bread is worldwide, and just because ramen is popular doesn't mean people know how to make it. If senku knows penicillin surely he would know bread...",2
98,"     Most, not all. In fact, ""yeastless"" bread was all mankind had for thousands of years.",2
99,"Nah, you don't need yeast, though that does make it pleasantly fluffy.    In australia we have  damper , and even the indigenous people had their own yeast-less bread.    Senku could probably get salt, and we all know that carbs + salt is a simple recipe for deliciousness.",1
100,Can't wait for them to explain Tsukasa...,2
101,"I think petrification is easier to explain, tho.",2
102,"I legit thought he was making pizza.    ""I'm going to make everyone's favorite food!""     Goes to wheatfield ",2
103,People thought the same in the manga too man.,2

110,"To be fair, the USSR went from rubble to space in 15 years through hard labor. Reasonably accurate comparison?",2
111,"Yeah, they also fucking murdered genetics as a science so… yah",2
112,Guess people downvote you because they don't know about the story of Lysenko and how the USSR tried to run an agricultural program on neo-Lamarckian principles because some higher ups thought it was more politically palatable than genetic inheritance.,1
113,Yup,1
114,Wasn't his plan from the beginning to make a nation of science? Probably with him as the ruler.    All hail Kaiser Senku von Lohengramm.,2

221,"Funny thing about black powder is that it's actually mostly saltpetre - 75:10:15  saltpetre:sulphur:charcoal  is a basic ratio. It seems like it should be mostly charcoal, to act as fuel for the explosion similar to a fire. But it needs to have so much potassium nitrate  saltpetre , as it's role is as an oxidising agent.         When black powder explodes  burns really quickly , it needs too much oxygen, too fast to get it directly from the air. Instead, combustion takes place directly using the oxygen from the potassium nitrate  it has 3 oxygens per molecule , allowing it to react fast enough to cause an explosion. Without it, it'd just burn quickly, not explode like you want it to.      Another fun fact is that this means black powder can and will burn underwater, as it doesn't need air to get oxygen to burn. It's near impossible to ignite while wet though. Flares, used by the military, survivalists and for road signalling also use this concept of having their own oxygen source on board to burn brightly, quickly, and will stay lit underwater and in torrential rain.",1

The fact they existed blew my mind. A simi auto weapon that could fire every second or so existing in the 1600's wow.   The fact that plate armor was actually composite two then three level armor that would stop a bullet a fairly recent discovery. We did put composite armor on tanks till end of WWII.",1
223,"Revolving and semi-automatic weapons aren't that hard of a concept to come up with, and it's certainly possible to make one with 1600s technology. To make  one , by hand, by a skilled craftsman working for ages on it, only to have to replace the whole thing when one part breaks in a week. The real advancement that turned them from curiosities to common weapons of war was precise tools and manufacturing techniques that could make them quickly, and make parts to precise enough specifications for interchangeable parts and easy repairs.",2
224,"Yeah true, big difference between ""it can be made"" and ""we're handing them out to every soldier as they go out into war conditions""",1
225,The NSA wants to know your location.     JK they already know it.,2
226,but all the science shown is true  atleast a large percentage of it ,2
227,"the ""cure all drug"" certainly isn't",1
228,"FWIW he caveats that he doesn’t know what she has and mentions bacteria specifically. I don’t think that was supposed to be taken seriously. And considering the extent of bacterial deaths prior to antibiotics, calling it a panacea is acceptable exaggeration.      Side note, in this world the pathogen is probably much more likely to be bacterial than viral not to mention the chronic nature when dealing with respiratory problems would point to bacterial .     Many of the viruses we have are the result of agriculture and have zoonotic hosts so for instance there at least won’t be any bird swine flu, or pox viruses.",1
229,"In any case, at best it's a ""cure much drug"".         That's assuming it's a pathogen at all and not a congenital disorder.",2
230,Yea I think the prospect of a congenital disorder or something like asthma was baked into his “i don’t even know what she has  this line is completely unneeded if he truly though it was a cure-all ” caveat.    I just think that saying it’s a cure all is acceptable hyperbole. It is one of the most important discoveries in human kind and in a pre-ag world  one which would be very hard for congenitally ill children as well   would  be roughly equivalent to a cure all in terms of preventing premature death especially in a world without war  among the population.,1
231,"Your ability to properly read and understand comments seems predictably ewual with your ability to understand what was said in the show.    In that you completely fuckin missed important details.    Senku clearly states that it  isn't  a cure all, he just used it as hyperbole and later clarified that it's just the best bet they've got.",1
232,he doesnt say that though. it was chrome who did.,2
233,     Surprised the mods haven't nuked your post,2
234,Mods are banning “lolis”?,2
235,"She's wearing a melon helmet. Clearly meant as a reference to ""melons"", a slang for breasts. Thus her very design is to invoke sexual reactions targetting her, a minor, and thus she must be banned.",2
236,"Mods are nuking posts that even so much as hint at spoilers. I had a post nuked a week ago by just saying something completely innocuous that nobody would have figured was a spoiler until someone else came along and said ""only manga-readers will understand"". And even then, there's zero context of the incredibly vague thing I said or how it could have possibly been a spoiler. Sufficient to say, OP I responded to did a similar thing, and I'm surprised the power-crazy mods haven't nuked it.",0
237,But this episode has already proved that she's the cutest.,1

239,Best cucurbit,1
240,     yeah this anime is pretty much overlord now.,1
241,Where does the green mold come in?,2
242,"Senku explained that there are two ways to create the ""cure-all"":    1. the bio route which is based on the very slim chance that they find the exact mold they need, and thus cannot be relied upon    2. the stone route that they're spending tons of time and energy on, but is sure to result in the desired product",2
243,Although one person could get lucky with the bio route that is way more manpower option as you need tons of people going everywhere taking samples to return and then tons of people to crow culture so yo can lower the odds to something more manageable. Glass wear production. And without refrigeration your limited as well.,2
244,Well I mean its not on the graphics,2
245,Yeah because they're taking the stone route instead. No mold involved at all.,2
246,There was literally a whole section of his speech explaining in clear terms why he is not using mould.    Have you tried paying attention to the show you are watching? It helps clear up confusion.,0
247,Clearly and undoubtedly the best girl. Not even Senku can prove me wrong on this.,1
248,Suika is awesome both as a character and as a plot device.,1
249,"So, does anyone know why Suika wears a melon on her head?",2
250,Yes.,1
251,Which is...?,2
252,2 episodes,2
253,"Man I'm really enjoying this arc a lot. The science aspect is by far it's biggest strength and it shows. The Senku squad is also pretty cool, but  Chrome  is still just the best. I really am digging this trial and error approach to science. Most scientific discoveries required grueling work beforehand and usually relied on the road paved by others before. The fact that Senku cannot achieve everything first try, even though he knows basically the correct way to achieve his goals, feels very authentic in a way.      Also the  reactions  the whole episode.",1
254,     Boichi is the only mangaka in WSJ besides Oda that can constantly make me lol hard with just the faces he draws. They are fucking hysterical.,1
255,"Oda makes otherwise dignified characters do reaction faces out of nowhere, or makes their reaction faces a running joke. Boichi's approach is that everyone is going to look fucking nuts when they have to react to something.    I love both.",1
256,"Something else i love is that EVERY character gets to be part of a joke. As soon as they are introduced. It's amazing, it really adds so much charm to the series.",1
257,"As much as I love Oda, he  like most mangaka really  has a tendency to kind of put his pretty female characters on a pedestal for goofy faces. ""No no no, these ones aren't for funny. These are for looking pretty. That's what they're for, and they always have to do that."" Boichi has no such reverence for his characters looks, and will compromise any of them for a joke, which I really respect. Come to think of it, the same could be said Gintama's Sorachi-sensei... Hm    Of course, Oda has gotten better about that recently. I remember when the most shocked expression we got Robin was  this . Look, her eyes aren't even bulging at all, and her mouth is barely open, like six inches.     But now we're getting  majesty  which is just obviously superior.",1
258,"     I knew it was coming, yet I fell for it.",1
259,"Um, what are they reacting to. Is it Luffy's bounty? Please tell me its Luffy's bounty.",2
260,"The first image is Usopp, Robin, and Franky finding out they caused the tontattas immense psychological trauma by instigating Doflamingo's ""I'm stepping down jk no I'm not"" stunt. The second is them  ""finding out that A: Luffy has finally arrived in Wano and B: Luffy fought with Kaido, lost, and got sent to fucking prison.""     Sorry, I had a spoiler-tag snafu that triggered the automod.",2
261,It’s Luffy messing up yet another carefully laid plan by doing whatever the fuck he feels like.,2
262,Man Robin is so underutilized post time skip.hope she shines in wano,1
263,I think your comment got deleted. Could you PM instead?,2
264,Nami had stupid reaction faces a lot for the time though. Kamie did too. I think Robin was spared specifically because she was an outsider who took a very long time to integrate. Now she's truly part of the crew.,1
265,"     I would watch this all day, it's so fun to see the ""ignorant"" people of the past experiencing the future goods. Their reactions are indeed golden, the educational part is well done, not to say the comedic aspect while Kohaku being the straight man  woman  fits perfectly.    I like how the show had slowed the pace to build this educational funny episodes while slowing reaching to Ruri. I'm actually enjoying how unique the show it's in this aspect.",1
266,"Agreed, I still thought it was a pretty good show before, but ever since Senku made the pulley to save Kohaku this has been even more and more of a ""waiting all week for the next episode"" show for me. And it's the only show like that that I have right now, along with Fruits Basket",1
267,Completely agree. It's only getting better and I'm scared it's setting my expectations too high and I'll be disappointed in the future lol,1
268,"I know what you mean. I went into this show with pretty reserved expectation but I end up enjoying each episode more and more, especially this arc so far. I think it does a really good job of being quite lighthearted and funny but still be carried by the underlying mystery of how this world came to be, as well as the science aspect to it, you just want to see whether they will succeed in their efforts. Also, Senku is such an amusing MC. Often super-intelligent characters have the tendency to be very detached from everything so it's hard to have a read on them but Senku has been really well written in my opinion. He has a couple of relatable moments and his motives are also very transparent and honest",1
269,"The number of the reactions has easily tripled since reaching the village, and I am so happy about it.",1
270,   Kohaku is cute af Part 2       Yes! Today we are blessed with a ton of awesome screenshot of our best girl! My personal fav is the Kohaku eating ramen. How about you?,1
271,Bobblehead Kohaku,2

274,Chibi Kohaku with big onigiri!,2
275,"Fucking weebs, I swear to god...    That said, definitely huge-head Kohaku.",2
276,"""People waged wars over pepper""    So true... How easily we forget how good we have it with the creature comforts of modern society. To Senku the ramen wasn't very good but to those people that have only eaten fish their whole lives, it was the best thing ever.    Also that moment when Senku realized they've been petrified so long  the Earth's axis tilt changed ",1
277,"     I wonder how realistic that is. He says 3700 years like it's a lot, but that's absolutely nothing on a planetary time scale.",2
278,"The Earth does shift around quite a bit though, on that scale. Plenty of modern constellations are in different places than they were during pyramid times.",2
279,"The wobble in Earth's tilt takes  about 25,000 years  to makes a full rotation. 3,700 years is enough to be noticeable. The North Star used to be Kochab rather than Polaris.",2
280,"Yeah, 3,700 years should be enough for Senku to notice that, for example, Polaris doesn't seem to remain fixed in the sky like it does currently. In fact I think Polaris would be moving around quite a bit in a pretty noticeable circle over the course of a night, so I'm surprised that Senku didn't notice it earlier.",2
281,"Actually, the earth can change around pretty quickly. The magnetic north pole is currently moving towards siberia at a speed of about 50km per year.    Some things about the earth and environment take a very long time to change, other things can be super fast. Like how quickly a mega volcano erupting could change the environment. Or a single point of failure causing a massive area of land to be completely flooded by the ocean.    3700 years is longer than the time between now and ancient greece. And I don't believe the north star has been the same star the whole time.",2
282,The Dutch even did genocides over pepper.,2

320,"   Dr.Stone went full Shokugeki no Soma.       As this episode  and the start of  ""Log Horizon""   shows, food has a massive impact on people's morale.    Imagine the following:    Eating fish every day.    No black pepper or salt or anything else as seasoning, black pepper comes from India.    Just unseasoned cooked fish.    All week all you did is eat fish.       Next week also all days fish.      Next week fish too.    A month has passed and all you ate is unseasoned fish.      Next month...fish.    And the next one after that? Fish. Unseasoned.    An entire year of mostly unseasoned fish.      Next year? Unseasoned fish.    An entire decade where all you ate was mostly unseasoned fish.      90% of all you life meals are unseasoned fish.      The fish you eat in your modern life has been seasoned in some way, otherwise the taste is quite bland.    The other 10% is meat you very very rarely eat on festivals...unseasoned meat, unsalted meat. Meat tastes pretty bland without any kind of seasoning. Also, it's not much because they have to share among 40 people.    Life would really suck.",0
321,Even worse: unseasoned fish without any proper side dish.    Although I think they'd at least have salt for seasoning the occasional meat.,0
322,"     I wonder about that.    They being a sea-side village, having salt would make sense...but last episode we saw that the concept of differentiating rocks or even put small rocks on your food  salt rocks  would be considered crazy.    Even chrome didn't salted his fish.",2
323,Taking into account that it is part of  Senku's  is safe to assume that they don't have any.,2
324,"Yes they do, Senku used salt in the very first episode. Last episode Chrome used both salt and copper to change the color of the fire, they have ammonia  from urine , coal  used it this episode , alcohol  or at least means to easily make it since it was already made in episode 2 . I wasn't sure about phosphorus but googling tells me it can be made using urine and sand so.. I guess it shouldn't be hard to make.    So 2 missing things which are required so that they can mix with the other starting elements to make the rest of the roadmap.",2
325,The salt used before by Chrome is different. A salt in chemistry is a compound made of an anion  an atom which was negatively charged  and a cation  an atom which was positively charged . The table salt you're used to is a salt following the chemical definition but not all of those are table salt  most of them are improper for consumption ,2
326,salt is honestly a pretty generic term. there are lots of non consumable salts. but it's probably pretty likely he just evaporated some sea water for it.,2
327,"Do you see any arrows leading into it? No, it's available from the start, just like Alcohol and, by this point, Iron.",2
328,Touché.,1
329,"Salt is pretty fundamental for survival at this tech level. One of the best ways of preserving food, and incredibly easy to get. It's very likely they have it.",2
330,they have to have a source that does not mean they know how to make it in large quantities though. Salt was a major primitive trade good and wars fought over it. So enough Salt to go on dishes most of the time would be a common problem for many groups.,2
331,"That was in a period of history where massive civilizations existed in areas that didn't have easy access to either the sea or salt mines, and needed to import large volumes of salt from areas that did, making it expensive. A small seaside village of less than 100 people shouldn't have any problems getting as much as they need.",2
332,I would put a focus on gathering mushrooms and onions. These two simply thing can bring so much flavor to any dish. Salt would be tough at this stand. I have no idea how the plastic in the oeacn would have broken down at this time so I won't try there for salt.,2
333,"Plastic long gone in Oceans, sea water breaks down Plastic fairly fast. Unfortunately the tiny plastic particles found even in bottom dwellers is a worry. But a few thousand years even the landfill stuff is breaking down, Plastic had probably done it's major damage and life is recovering with new species evolving to fill gaps caused by extinctions. I like the saying save the Earth, Na the Earth will be fine, it's save the humans that we should be concerned with.  Earth will recover at least tills son heats up in the next billion years to kill off everything and boil off the oceans as the sun is getting hotter very slowly as it runs down on fuel, not a component of global warming debate the increase is tiny every year. So for the Earth to be inhabited in our conditions in the next 300 million years or so something will start have to start building orbital reflectors to reduce sun light, a task that could be done at current tech at extreme expense not yet needed, so planet can make it a few more billion years till sun goes Red Giant.      Plastic is a unstable construct, unfortunately one that lasts too longe for our needs and of course it returns to the state of oil product and additives it was when it breaks up.",2
334,Dude unseasoned anything tastes horrible. Even rice tastest bad with no salt.,0
335,"They will be using a salt lick at a minimum you can not live without salt, Neither can most animals, salt licks make for good ambush hunting. But salt will often be in very short supply in primitive tribes not something that goes on every dish.",2
336,"Yeah, that was my first thought as well. I thought it was going to go the ""let's introduce spices"" route. But nope, instead let's just go for making full blown ramen.",2
337,"thats not really true tho, while Suika was sneaking around the village it was shown that they have plenty of vegetables and fruits even going as far as showing part of a watermelon garden. after that when  Senku  was cooking the ramen he got eggs and chicken pretty easy  so easy that they didn't bother to explain from where, probably from the village . Fish is definitely a big part of their menu , but not as huge as you make it",2
338,"Now imagine those vegetables without seasoning.    As pointed out, Senku's roadmap involves salt meaning they don't have any.    Boiled lettuce or leek is just water-rich fibrous plants, tasteless food for humans can eat. They are actually worse than fish: Fish without seasoning is bland, boiled vegetables alone have no taste at all.    Fruit could be a rare delicacy considering they have to share among 40 people and fruits are in no way as common as other plants.",2
339,"Senku's roadmap also includes alcohol, which he's already invented; and urine, which they almost certainly have. Just because it's on the roadmap doesn't mean it's not there, it only means they need it.",2
340,Senku had salt in his science shack in EP1. They put it on the mushrooms theyre eating.    “Everything tastes good with a little salt”,2
341,"Yes, had, he does not currently have salt.",2
342,"This, heck even Chrome used salt and copper  both on the roadmap  last episode to change the colors of the fire. The roadmap shows everything they need to get the antibiotic, if they didn't show what they already had it would look like there are pieces missing, given that they really only lack the 2 base things required for the mixing of what they already have  electricity and sulfuric acid ",2
343,"They don't have urine, they have the means to acquire it",2
344,Fruits were probably also shittier back then without so many generations of selective breeding. If you've ever tried wild grapes  like the first ep  you'll probably appreciate how far we've come.,2
345,"But keep in mind that this takes place in the future. Not exactly sure how fruit plants would  actually  bare without any humans, but assuming they stay alive  which they did  they would almost certainly be rich in flavor since they are the direct ancestors of the selectively bred, tasty fruit plants.",2
346,"The blue squares are starting points. They most likely have salt and alcohol already. This is especially true when,  ""The founders of the village created legends with the specific goal of trying to pass down as much information as possible to the generations that would come after them. Some of those legends included what is and isn't safe to eat."" ",2

349,"     Probably someone tasted the salt of a dried river.     Salt was so valuable people used it as currency in the past.     Salary comes from salt, and makes sense: In a world where all your meals were bland, working in exchange of a magical powder that made them more flavorful would be a great deal.     People even traded gold for salt. ",2
350,"Plus you could dry meat with it, and make brines and broths.    Hell if my ass had to walk everywhere or ride an animal to get to all of my destinations, I'd want some fucking jerky with me for a snack so you best bet I'm trade gold for salt.",2
351,If I was used to starving nearly to death every winter I'd sure as hell want a fuck ton of jerky.,1
352,That's probably more useful than the flavor. Salt was very important for preserving food back then in addition to being a nutrient we need to live.,1

Given how critical salt is for basic bodily processes  this is why salt tastes good to just about every mammal - we need at least a bit of it to survive , there's no way we outgrew that animal habit when we finally evolved consciousness. At some point, we just started asking ""hmm, what else could we do with this stuff?"" and ""how do we get more faster?""

366,"     Someone probably dropped some food on a salt rock, 5 second ruled, then found out it tasted pretty good.",1
367,I'm more curious how man discovered cooking with fire.  Tasted some game that was killed by lightning or died in a forest fire?,2
368,I'm sure you're familiar with the fine smell when you throw a piece of meat in a hot pan.  Accidents happen all the times and when a piece of meat fell into the fire it smelled delicious. The same reason how coffee was discovered  At least how the myth says it . Humans are curious creatures by default and if you have something valuable as meat you even eat it if it was burned,2

373,"Nah, if they did actually eat fish they'd be fine. Fish are pretty nutritionally complete all things considered, sure you'll be deficient in one thing or another but that's life, no-one back then had all their nutritional needs met.    Vitamin C is actually the biggest problem if you have fish only based diet, but if you're eating like that the amount of vitamin C you need actually lowers and there are small enough amounts of Vitamin C, you'd just have to eat everything.

380,"They have fruits and vegetables which bring variety and texture to the table, although certainly not the flavor-laden variety we have today. And they live in a fishing village. The ocean is salty and you can extract some salt simply by boiling it over a fire. Hell, even monkeys have been  using saltwater as a seasoning , so it's not inconceivable that someone in that village decided saltwater tastes good.        Yes it's still an incredibly boring and bland palate, but they're not eating  literally fish and nothing else .",2

And given salt's high desireability for its flavor and as a preservative in other civilizations  to the point of wars over control of salt lakes , it's not impossible to see that they would want to regularly make trips to boil saltwater and bring it back.

384, I'm 10 billion percent Senku does qualify as a genius .,1
385,"In Japan, the word that is translated to ""genius"" basically means ""super talented from birth"".  Think back to Naruto - you have all those people with genetic powers, and then you have Rock Lee who only got the ""genius at hard work"" platitude from his sensei.  So unless Senku was pretty much born with a tremendous IQ, he's not a ""genius"" as Japanese would see it.",2
386,What you are referring to is call a prodigy. Even then i would still consider senku as a prodigy.,1
387,"Eh, not necessarily, just a fuckin neeeerd.    This is all stuff that we could have learned and memorised by that age if we had studied instead of playing videogames lol.",1
388,"He most definitely is, and no you most definitely wouldn't have known all that, he knows everything and I DOUBT he studied science history and science needed for survival. He's a prodigy student and was interested in aerospace, hence a branch of science which is completely useless here he was also probably interested in computer sciences and physics and all that as they're quite related. Yet without any preparation he remembers the exact ingredients and their proportions to create all the things he needs... Which on the other hand, he'd never need to make or care about back in the day. Which means he has photographic memory or close to it. He's probably something of a  John Neumann ",2
389,"Genius, untranslated has the same meaning in my language as well = talented from birth. Odd, I thought since it's the same word in English it'd bare the same meaning...",2
390,"Genius doesn't always mean IQ, though. Even more so if we go by your translation. You can have geniuses in pretty much everything from athletics to art to science. And he's at the very least a genius of memory.",2
391,Only if he was born with genius level memory instead of training it through hard work.,2
392,"I would expect Senku, of all people, to know born talent is a quite small factor in what people usually call genius. But it does make sense given the Japanese interpretation.",2
393,"Sure, but surely he meant he has to work hard towards the goal instead of it going right almost instantly every time.",2
394,"In that context, he was just pointing out that he's not smart enough to change the luck needed for the biological route. However, I find the fact that he doesn't consider himself a genius quite endearing.",2
395,"It worth noting that Senku  never  created something new, all the stuff he made so far were things he already knew, and probably so is everything he's gonna make for a long time.    He knows a lot of things, and is very knowledgeable, smart, but to himself, he's only applying what he learned. He never created something new like the true geniuses he knows.",2
396,"Yes, but it's also worth noting that he's the incarnation of the omnidisciplinary scientist trope at highschool age.",2
397,"That's the thing: he only remembers all those stuff. He knows how to make the stuff, but didn't discover it on his own, He learned it from a teacher or a book. He merely walking a road laid down before him by countless great minds, each paying a great toll to lay down one cobblestone.",2
398,"You're taking scientists a little too lightly. Just think of the time it would take for one human to reach that level of knowledge, and think of the effort necessary to reach it in highschool. It's harder to discover new things when you have to catch up with at least thousands of years of scientific advance first.    Building the road is hard indeed, but so is walking down the entire road when it has become hundreds of kilometers long.",2
399,I was talking about what Senku probably thinks of himself. I know as everyone here how much of genius Senku is.,1
400,"     Not much, we literally teach this stuff in highschool classes.     Senku hasn't even made a battery yet, and I made them in highschool chemistry. They were so easy to make with the right materials that we stayed back after class to fuck around and electroplate random objects. But senku has a magnet now, so as soon as he can forge metal, he'll be able to induce current with that.    If we can teach it to bratty ass kids, then senku who is  super  passionate could easily surpass them.",2
401,"Oh, you teach the process of making antibiotics and all processes needed to obtain the auxiliary materials and tools with stone age tools in highschool? Tell me more about.    Instead of boasting about your battery  which he hasn't made because at the moment it's useless  you should pay attention to what the dude makes, in how much time and with which technology level.",0
402,"     The fact that you think I was boasting says more about you than me.    It wasn't just me that made a battery, literally everyone in the class did, it was a standard and easy activity.     This is my point. You can teach this shit to any teenager, you don't need to be a genius.    Senku doesn't need to be super smart to know this stuff, he is just super passionate and put in the hard work to study this stuff. Whereas most teenagers just play videogames and shit  I did too .",0
403,"The fact that you specifically mentioned that you did a battery even if everyone does that is boasting, kid.        And when you'll grow up a little, you'll realise that intelligence is a combination of memory and the ability to piece things together. In other words, that hard work anyone can do. The more knowledge you memorise and understand, the easier it is to piece together any new thing you try to learn.     I'm sure you're still hung up on the fairytales from highschool, like Newton's who discovered gravity after getting hit by an apple, but those are just fairytales.",0
404,"     How?    Simply stating that I did something classifies as boasting? In what way?    The whole point of what I was saying was to try and point out that I'm   NOT   special for doing that. Trying to boast that what I did was impressive would completely defeat the point I was trying to make.    Again, this says a lot more about you than me that you think I was boasting for simply stating something that I did in highschool as an example.         I see, so your ego has been hurt and you're trying to recover by acting unreasonably dominant based on our completely unestablished ages.         It's funny that you think this is something you realize ""as you get older"" as if it is somehow linked to life experience? The semantics of the word ""intelligence"" are in no way linked to your age.     Common usage varies, but I prefer the use of ""intelligence"" to mean ""fluid intelligence"" as opposed to ""crystal intelligence""         Oh you're 'sure' are you? Despite absolutely no evidence to support such an assertion? Seems like just another way to heal a damaged ego.    I like how I never  directly  attacked your ego, but your ego seems damaged, and now you feel the need to recover by inventing unfounded narratives.    What does this say about you I wonder.",0
405,"I'll leave the psychoanalysis up to you, kid. Stating you did something everyone did is meaningless. After all, why would you give someone a piece of information they already have? Unless you actually think that not everyone has that information and revealing it gives your arguments more authority, a.k.a. boasting. If you were older, you'd talk about things you've done in undergrad, since they're usually much more impressive than anything in highschool, and not everyone majors in the same thing, so it wouldn't have been boasting. But I don't mind you blaming it on my ego. The fact that you had no counter-arguments to offer and tried to steer the discussion towards other stuff is a signal that this discussion is over.    And the way people perceive intelligence is different from person to person. The dictionary definition is too vague, and people have argued over a more concrete definition for centuries.",0
406,"     No it's not. I was stating that it is normal, and not a genius thing to know.         To make sure it is established so I can then build my point off of it and have it make sense.         That's not what boasting is my dude. To try and state that boasting is simply any time you give someone information is a pretty big stretch.         I gave up on going to university for maths or physics as I had planned because I fucking hated the school system and how it constantly held me back.     Since highschool I've gone into the arts and so far stayed since I enjoy it, I can teach myself and I can get a job without the need for an expensive piece of paper.    I'm also way smarter than I was in highschool since I've put a massive emphasis on patching up some of the major character flaws I had back then. Not showing up to class and never studying might work for acing the top classes in highschool, but it's not a great way to reach my full potential.    I have a friend who got a massive scholarship to study mathematics and he's bugged me some to go study with him again like highschool days.     Is that enough boasting for you? Since you seem so keen on trying to assert your dominance here as well as call me a boaster, I thought I'd actually give it a shot lmao.         What are you talking about? You're the one who started trying to call me out for boasting instead of discussing the point, and now you're once again trying to reframe this to blame me and save your ego. I presented my points, you keep repeating the same inane bullshit.    You think you're witty, and ""catching me out"" but I'm legitimately enjoying this. Because I don't have an ego so easy to break.         Oh really? Because I seem to remember  you  being the one to state that ""when I grow up a little"" I'd understand the  true  definition of intelligence. Whilst I was the one stating the common definition varies and then presenting my personal preference.    Funny how that works, huh?    This reframing you're doing is so transparent that I'm not even sure  you're  conscious of it.",0
407,"Stating a piece of information that's common knowledge is boasting, not stating any piece of information.    If you enjoy what you're doing then I'm genuinely glad for you. Staying in the school system is not compulsory to reach your true potential, that's true. And since you were kind enough to share that, then I'll tell you where I stand: I was the guy who always went to classes and studied until he made sure he understood what he was doing, which made me valedictorian in both highschool and engineering undergrad. And now I'm in postgrad in a university that's in the world's top 20, while working for the best company in Europe in my field. There, some boasting on my side too. I suppose that does explain why we don't see eye to eye, though.    I do apologise for calling you kid, though, that was indeed a mistake on my part. I'm also enjoying this. The people who know me and what I do appreciate my skills, so I'm not hurting over some anonymous person saying things.    Regarding the intelligence part, let me quote what you said: "" It's funny that you think this is something you realize ""as you get older"" as if it is somehow linked to life experience? The semantics of the word ""intelligence"" are in no way linked to your age. "" - I must apologise if I misunderstood, as english isn't my first language, but it seems to me like you state here that the definition of intelligence is fixed, rather than varying as you now claim.    And concerning the deflecting part, I did state that Senku's way beyond the things you mentioned about highschool, and that recreating modern things like antibiotics using stone-age tools along with his encyclopedic knowledge makes him pretty much a genius, which you tried to write off by claiming that those things don't make him smart because anyone can learn them, which I found to be a dubious claim. Afterwards, I got condescending and you got all psychoanalytical, while still not stating what you think makes someone smart and using vague terms like fluid or crystal intelligence.    So, if we're finished with the personal jabs, I think it would be your turn to say what do you think makes a person a genius and why Senku doesn't qualify.",1
408,"     You're really just going to keep repeating yourself instead of engaging with my increasingly detailed counterpoints huh. I guess you're clinging onto this piece of bullshit forever.         Oh lol, idk how experienced you are, but I've been using some very precisely crafted phrasing here.         Part of what makes him able to do it though is just plot armour. The characters seem to always magically be able to find the required resources in their immediate vicinity and only get ""bad luck"" when it's plot relevant.    And penicillin is at least kind of the starting point where I think he will be going in to genius territory as he will undoubtedly be doing even more impressive things into the future.    But for now I still believe he could be a studious teenager who happened to study the right things.          It was more that any highschooler can learn these things, therefore someone as studious as him could learn them  as well as  memorise them and learn some information about how to acquire the ingredients.    These days you can find youtube videos on ""how to make sulfuric acid out of these weird ingredients"" or ""today we refine bog iron""    If after a couple more episodes he was like ""shit, penicillin and gunpowder are the best things I could think of, I don't remember anything else, whoops"" then he'd be a more normal kid. But he'll eventually show himself to be undoubtedly a genius.         The fun part          Wikipedia page     Tbh I haven't read heavily into the terminology, but my simplification of it is basically:    Fluid intelligence: logical reasoning, lateral thinking, creativity, etc.    Crystal intelligence: the raw information you can hold.    Or crystal = knowledge, fluid = how fast you can gain new knowledge.    I generally see intelligence as not being what you know, but how well you can process, organise and synthesise information.    So someone can be a genius, but super lazy and thus not know anything, while a non-genius could have a lot of knowledge that they had to work super hard for.    As far as I'm aware in neuroscience, fluid intelligence is something that can be linked to genetics and deteriorates basically from the age of 20.     But I personally feel that fluid intelligence can be increased by studying the functionality of your brain by doing black box experiments on yourself, recognising inefficiencies and retraining your subconscious processes to work more efficiently.     Which is what I've basically dedicated my life to lol.    I'm likely to have a genetic advantage in the department of fluid intelligence. But I also credit a lot of my intelligence to my focus on learning how to learn, and I think anyone could be taught this from a young age and gain a distinct advantage if schools weren't terrible and underfunded.",0
409,"Let me rephrase that first thing: I believe that a piece of information labeled as common sense information is labeled as such because people start off with the assumption that other people know it. Otherwise, I don't see how it's different from any other piece of information. Thus stating it is superfluous. I understand that you see things otherwise, and I just wanted to make my stance clear, not to argue anymore on this topic, as we've reached a point where it's just a matter of subjective preference.    I think the anime skips quite a lot of the resource-searching parts. There was a significant effort involved in that iron-sand gathering, even if it seemed quite short. Same with the nitric acid gathered for revivals. And for the time being, they didn't look for many materials that would be hard to find in the wild  don't forget that to get the sulfur needed for gunpowder they traveled to the nearest volcano .    Ok, I understand your definition of intelligence, even if I don't agree with it. As far as I can see, a lazy genius would be hard to distinguish from a hardworking normal person, which kind of contradicts the way that label is generally applied. Besides, my reasoning is that the more information you know and understand, the easier it is to process, organise and synthesise new information, so fluid and crystal intelligence can't be effectively separated. I do agree that you can train intelligence.     ;               This part I don't agree at all with. First, penicillin making with stone-age tools isn't in the compulsory high-school curriculum. Second, I actually wonder if you can find such a process anywhere, given the late discovery of penicillin. If not, then Senku probably developed that roadmap himself, piecing together everything needed with the constraints of the environment and technology level. While there are many videos and books that can teach you how to DIY complex stuff, they're usually starting with stuff you have around the house or can readily buy in the 20th 21st century. To summarise, I think Senku's encyclopedic knowledge combined with the ability to effectively use that information given the tech level he's at is enough to make him a genius.",2
410,"He's not really though. None of the knowledge he has shown so far is super advanced, with penicillin being the most impressive so far.    A lot of this knowledge isn't hard to learn at all, it's just that whether or not you remember it makes a BIG difference in that primitive world.    Like making black powder, you could literally google it right now and be like ""ah, I get it"". It's just a matter of committing it to memory before google stops existing.    I was learning stuff like this in my highschool chemistry and physics classes. You don't need to be a genius, just super passionate like senku, spending all your time studying these scientific fields and you could have been the same.",2
411,"Mate, this isn't a boasting thread. The dude built his first working rocket in middle school. Your highschool classes do cover stoichiometry and chemical reactions, as well as basic physics, but not the processes of refining compounds from natural materials without any modern tools or the many engineering considerations to make when applying the laws of physics in the real world.",1
412,"You're missing my point though.     I'm not saying ""any highschool kid could do what senku is doing""    I'm saying that if we can teach this shit to unenthused highschool kids, then someone who is super passionate and hardworking like senku could learn all the  extra  stuff that he has even without being a genius.    And again, the fact that me saying ""I learnt highschool level chemistry in my highschool chemistry class"" comes across as boasting to you says a lot more about you than me.",0
413,"Again, the fact that you specifically mention things that everyone does as if they were special is an attempt to boast, albeit a poor one.    And again, genius is not what you think it is. If you work hard enough you'll realise it at some point. In real life, genius is a label people who don't work hard put on people who work hard in order to feel better about themselves. After all, if people would see and read about geniuses while knowing that the only thing that separates them from said geniuses is the fact that they were lazy, they'd feel pretty shitty. This way they can just say ""but that guy's a genius, I'm not so there's no reason for me to push myself that hard"" and excuse themselves.",0
414,"     ???    Do you not realize how the assertion that I am framing them as being special would completely go against the larger point I was using those examples to support? My entire point was that it  isn't  special, hence why senku doesn't  have  to be a genius.    Or the fact that if I were wanting to make myself seem special, I would have specifically avoided stating that they are things a regular highschool student can do?    This assertion of yours stands on an increasingly weak foundation, yet you seem willing to continue grasping.         Vaguely ""working hard"" makes you more qualified on defining the word ""genius"" huh? And you somehow know that you've done more of this vague ""hard work"" than me.    Interesting proposition.         Time for a lightning round of psycho-anlysis!    You think genius is just a term for people who work hard to defend the ego of lazy people, and you so strongly self identify as a ""hard worker"" that you would earlier in this reply assert yourself as more-so than myself with no evidence in support of this.    Your illogical assertion that my simple statement of things I did in highschool being boasting could seem to imply that your ego was threatened  probably subconsciously  by my statement of these things being normal. Then afterwards you switch the roles to try and instate yourself as the norm and thus I must be boasting, rather than myself being the norm and you being threatened.    These two observations in conjunction would seem to show an overall method you've developed to reframe the world in such a way that puts yourself up on high to feed a fragile ego.    A fear of not having this ""inherent talent"" led eventually to rejecting the possibility of its existence, leaving your worldview in a place that allows you to believe you have full agency in your life. As well as reframing the concept of genius that you feared was unobtainable to instead be something along the path that you are already following.    I wonder how I did. Since we seem to be having two separate conversations and you seem like you might just continue to repeat your unfounded assertions in a boring way, I thought I'd let myself have some fun.",0
415,"If you would truly believe they weren't special then you wouldn't have mentioned them. There's no sense in giving someone an information they already have.    I also did not state that I work hard, you made that supposition yourself. I said that people who work hard enough realise that fact. This could very well be something that someone else once said to me, not something I came up with myself. I find the way you jump to conclusions amusing.    Again, it is illogical to state something everyone did unless you think that you're somehow more special for having done that, which you prove by asserting that the fact that you mentioned normal things could somehow be ""threatening"".    Also, your psychoanalysis is somewhat off. Since I'm a bit bored, I'll give you some pieces of information to work with. It's not the fear of not having that almost negligible advantage ""inherent talent"" that led me to that view, but rather the reverse. Imagine working hard for years only for that work to go unacknowledged when people label you ""talented"" and think that all your achievements are because you were born under a lucky star or with the right genes.    But do continue, please. I find the fact that you're trying to sound smart by making vague and improbable deductions quite amusing. If you try enough, you might actually hit upon something else than some general identifier like hardworking. You might also try to prove your high intelligence  you must think yourself quite intelligent since you think you're in a high enough position to judge others  by ""deducing"" other general stuff, like gender, hair color, etc. I'm sure there's a quick statistic you can google to have a reasonable probability of being right.",0
416,"     No?    You seemed to be under the impression that they are special. So I presented that it is normal.    1. It's important to state information that is vital to a point you are making in order for clarity    2. It's not to state myself as above, but that you simply may not have thought back to your time at highschool and been like ""oh yeah, I did learn stuff similar to this"".    3. Furthermore, the ""it is normal"" was only the first half of the proposition, with the second half being ""so an extraordinary worker could be expected to know this + more"". You can't treat it as if I simply said the first half by itself and treated it as revolutionary information.         You say that people who work hard realize something, and then state that thing as if you know it.     So besides you claiming yourself to be a hard worker, you are someone who believes the words of others and states them as irrefutable fact with not even personal experience to back it up, huh?    I was giving you the benefit of the doubt by assuming you meant that you are a hard worker. Trying to claim that you are instead just a sheep who follows others completely blind is really more of an insult to yourself than what I had said.    This seems like a pretty weak attempt to fight fire with fire here. If you think I won't notice the reactionary mimicry you're showing in the structure of the argument now that I've started seriously threatening your ego, then you're mistaken.         Normal things could threaten you if you find yourself to be abnormal whilst wishing for normalcy. I could not have known whether you were normal, so it couldn't have been a purposeful attack on you without that knowledge.    Otherwise I've covered this above. You're acting as if I stated these things as some sort of revolutionary piece of information when I did no such thing. They were used as the beginning to a larger point which then benefitted my overall point.         As expected.         Nah, it's kind of a one time deal. It becomes boring with multiple tries, feel free to go hire a freudian psychologist though.         Haha, your self awareness is comically low. Or you're bad at signalling and can only speak in such a serious tone.    To say this while being the one consistently saying ""well when you work hard"" ""when you grow up"" etc. Is quite funny.    You'll notice before something like a ""psychoanlysis"" I can signal with a sarcastic comment like ""time for a lightning round"" to show some self awareness. Either you have none, or need to incorporate some signalling.     Or maybe you're just like a person in chess who can only think one move ahead. You see a chance for an attack without any thought to how it could be countered.         White, straight, brown hair, male,  nobody likes you when you're  23 years old, and a fetish women in peacoats    My replies grow lazy as its 2am",0
417,"Ok, the last part really made me laugh. You still have to work a little on it. Regarding the rest, Freud's theories were proven wrong, so I wouldn't pay to hear suppositions that carry no more value than the ones you made.    The usual approach for a piece of common sense information like the one you've given is to start with the assumption that everyone knows it  that's why it's considered common sense information , and only if someone proves they don't to explicitly state it. Otherwise, it's a weak attempt at a boast in my opinion. And children do often attempt to state normal things they did as being extraordinary when they try to boast, which is why I called you kid.    As for the hardworking part, I just pointed out that you're ignoring other possibilities when making those assumptions, falling for the same fallacy that I did when I called you kid.",1

434,"That’s fair, there certainly could be other people that already made it out, but those places wouldn’t have lasted long. The chance of multiple people being woken up in Japan from nitric acid, let alone one person, is incredibly small. Their statue bodies would have been moved away eventually, the buildings would collapse, and the containers of these products would be long gone. Someone would have either had to undergo the same thing as Senku  which took a long ass time  or happened to have a concentrated nitric acid product open with them at the time.    So I highly doubt these are descendants of statue people, and are actually the dwindling descendants of people who somehow didn’t get statued. Maybe people who were far underground at the time.",1
435,Sorry forgot I was posting in the r anime rather than the new released chapter in r manga. I don't want to spoil things so I'll stop now. Nothing I have said in the previous comment was about the series so no spoilers thankfully.,1
436,"from what we dont know even in the manga, there's nothing to say more people around the could've revived like that either. And Senku was probably the only one in Japan lucky enough.",1
437,Remember that senku didn't sit exposed to nitric acid for 3700 years. Most of the time was him being moved around so that he could eventually be in a position to be touched by it. The actual process might not take that long.    Someone else could have just got lucky and found themselves in that position sooner.    There's no way people would be speaking perfect japanese after 3700 years of living in primitive tribes.,2
438,"Could have, but again, multiple people would have had to gotten lucky at around the same time    And as for that, pretty sure the only reason they’re speaking perfect japanese is because it’s an anime. Some liberties have to be taken for the sake of the plot",1
439,"     It's not so unlikely that you can just rule it out though, it's perfectly possible. 3700 years is a long time for that to happen.         The exact same sentiment applies to people being unpetrified though.",1
440,"It is possible but still extremely unlikely, and still probably not the case.     And there’s a sizeable difference between everybody speaking the same language so that the intended audience can understand and plot devices. It is still far more likely its descendants of unpetrified people, not statue people",2
441,"     I really don't understand why you think this, it seems like you just want to, and thus do.    There's really no reason to believe that in 3700 years people couldn't have come unpetrified.    There's also the problem of literally everyone being petrified. Who are these magical ""unpetrified people"" that you're talking about when it's pretty well established that  everyone  was petrified.    You'd rather  go against  the established information rather than go with the theory that makes most sense given the information we have?",0
442,"Because, again, the likelihood of two people  at least , both male and female, becoming unpetrified in the same area of Japan, at the same general time period over 3700, is nonsensical. I don’t really know how else to explain how damn unlikely that is.     We’ve established that to wake up you other need a concoction of nitric acid, or  natural occurring nitric acid, which requires both being awake the entire time and getting extremely lucky in your placement as the environment shifts. This further adds to it being extremely unlikely that two other people went through the same thing",2
443,     You dont know how to explain it because you have no actual logic behind it.    Multiple people could be revived in the same area simply because being close to eachother means they can be exposed to the same acidic environment as eachother.         We've also established that literally every single person was petrified.    Your assertion that there could possibly be people who just  weren't  petrified for literally no reason seems more logical to you than the alternative which is unlikely but at least possible?,0
444,What if the village is just a bunch of aliens that look human? Like an alien colony.,2
445,I would have gone with there's a bunch of RNG in naturally reviving.    If anyone survived the event I would imagine they would have scavenged enough surviving tech to not have regressed to that point.,2
446,"Yeah, RNGsus isn’t a kind god. Not to mention at least two people in the same general area would have had to both woke up at the same time, because if one person knew how to wake up more statues, there would be a hell of a lot more people, and it takes two to make a village",2
447," ""You're not far off"" ",1
448,Someone passed down some modern nudity taboo's or the girls would be going topless when the boys did. And the Japanese thong bottoms actually used by swimmers who were working while most places nude swimming was there rule till mid 1800's. Topless women pearl divers in Japan lasted well into modern times.  It drives me somewhat nuts when shows about pre western nudity culture show women covering breasts when historically they did not. At least in 60's and 70's when I was they would censor the toplessness by showing back views and the likes but not the modern world of lies where people insist on pretending modern taboo standards always existed.,2
449,"Meh, just because Japan and various other societies did not develop nudity taboos does not mean that they are some impossible thing either. It basically depends on both the availability of clothing and the usefulness of it in protection, along with random societal factors. Would it be reasonable for a prehistoric culture to have no nudity taboos? Sure. Is it also reasonable that they might have developed some independently? Also quite possible. They could even be silly ones, like always wearing a mask, or always making sure to wear boots, if nothing else. It happens.",2
450,     Yeah. kind of like what Senku said in the episode. Kind of.,2
451,The village ancestors were IMO people who simply didn't turn to stone. Maybe they were underground or whatever.,2
452,So much time had passed that even stars moved and Earth's axis shifted. That's crazy. Senku must be thankful that the villagers aren't some crazy inquisitors who are burning scientific people for heresy.    Chrome is literally me playing alchemy game. Mixing all the stuff hoping that it'll turn into something useful and won't kill you.,2
453,      Axial Percession  is a thing.,2
454,"So they are actually so far in the future that not only is Polaris no longer the pole star, they have also skipped the pole star after it  Errai  and are currently in a period that has no pole star at all. The closest they have is ""somewhere about halfway between Beta and Iota Cephei and a little ways towards Errai.""     That compass of theirs is problematic as well: Magnetic North is some distance away from True North, making compasses less accurate at higher latitudes. Magnetic North also moves over time, but unlike the stars it drifts  randomly . It's even possible that Earth underwent a magnetic field reversal while they were statues so that compass might actually be pointing  South .  Although I suppose in a Stone World it doesn't really matter if the north pole of their lodestone is the same end that it would have been in our time. ",2
455,"I mean, what even is ""north?"" It's just a direction we have decided matters, because we can sort of tell where it is. If Chrome has a compass and it points ""north,"" then that's about as north as anything else.",2
456,"North is actually pretty important, when it comes to things like weather and climate which then effect culture.    Cultures tend to unify within areas of similar climate, and the climate changes most distinctly when changing latitude.    For general short distance navigation though, you just need to have a consistent way to get your bearings. Any consistently visible and stationary landmark, or device that constantly points in a single direction would be useful.    But the north star is also notable in that it  doesn't move  like the rest of the sky. If the earth's axis tilts, then the old north star will start rotating in the sky just like all the other stars, making it a less consistent landmark.",2
457,"Which is why this culture uses other navigational tools. There are better ways of telling latitude, such as sun angle. Unless you're making significant journeys, having a consistent direction tracker is much more important than knowing latitude.",2
458,Also worth noting: the magnetic north pole would have moved all over the place as well. It currently moves at a rate of 55km per year and is moving from canada towards siberia.,2
459,The Catholic Church did that to maintain power and control over the poor so without organized religion I think they are safe.,1
460, Is that you Gaston? And Lefou too!!     The Great Detective Suika just became the most useful member of the nation of science. Senku better not screw this up.,1

478,"That's exactly why the episode a while back was called ""Stone world: the Beginning"". The prologue is done and the setup is complete, now on to the true fun.",1
479,"it's nice not hearing ""AAAAAAH! SENKU!"" every episode lol",1
480,"Chrome casually dropping how he basically re-invented compasses all by himself is lowkey the biggest feat yet. Senku is ""just"" finding creative ways of making stuff he already knows about, but for stone age standards, Chrome is a revolutionary innovator.",1
481,"     Uh, I call bullshit on at least half of this statement.",2
482,"Well even Senku recognises that all of his knowledge is built on the shoulder's of all the ones that have come before him. He doesn't treat his intelligence as genius, rather as the result of constant learning from failures. Which is also a really good message to convey to kids.",1
483,"There's just no way to know that much at that age lol. Science is a really really expansive field, and what he's doing is very far from what he was interested in before turning to stone, yet he knows exact recipes for everything and even their history...",1
484,"If you've obsessed over something for 10 years, I'm sure you could memorise most of it. Most of the grunt work and research has already been done.     Of course, it's anime, so some anime rules apply too. But my main point was that this is Senku's perception of himself and humanity in general. Monkeys scraping to go onwards  hence the whole monkeys mini arc ",1
485,"You really seriously underestimate how much ""science"" there is. And there are no ""general scientists"" even those who would specialize in this specific type, would still rely on notes, otherwise they would end up trying to remember irrelevant stuff their entire life instead of working and learn.     But this guy is waaay out of his field and has everything memorized to the detail, that means he must be on Neumann's level.",1
486,"Sometimes I get the impression that the way the word 'tensai' is used in Japanese has slightly different implications from 'genius', which is how it's usually translated. Maybe a cultural thing, but 'tensai' always struck me as having an implication of almost being blessed, having everything come easy by default. So what Senku is meaning here probably is ""we're neither gods nor blessed by them"", aka, we'll have to take the safe, hard road rather than rely on some improbable stroke of luck  for penicillin .",1

488,Wow 24 minutes fly by so fast! But I can still hold off reading the manga! ,1

492,"I'm personally really thankful for Suika's voice. She's one of my favourites in the manga, but having an overly cutesy little anime kid voice could have been a make-or-break deal for me enjoying her in the anime.     Fortunately now she sounds closer to an actual child than an anime loli child!",1
493,read it ! you would appreciate the anime more,1
494,This is one of the few series that I somewhat regret reading the manga first. There are so many things that happen that are weeks months away or might even be saved for season 2 depending on the pacing that only being able to watch one episode a week is torture.,1
495,why does that make you regret reading the manga first? that sounds like a point towards why you would read the manga,1
496,I will! Most likely as soon as the anime finishes because I like lo look forward to the next week not knowing what happens next,1
497,"I've regretted reading the source for anything that got an anime adaptation.  I'd only read the manga LN if I was sure it would never be adapted ever.    If it's something that's actually being adapted right now, I see no reason to read spoilers for it",1
498,That's how I feel about stuff that I already read that THEN gets an anime adaptation like Shield Hero and Fire Force.,2
499,"because most adaptions  like this one  will only be adapting like a quarter of the released material, and will never catch up, or because adaptions are very hit or miss and can be worse than their manga  not like this one ",2

There are no real dips in quality so there is a lot to look forward to regardless.",1
544,Yup. Started reading the manga a few days ago and already read half of it. Its a great read.,1
545,Regret because it ruined their enjoyment of watching the show blind?,2
546,I did it after the third episode. Best decision I've ever made in reguards to an Anime Manga series.

French Revolution.    Food is an important staple and not getting enough variety can lead to malnutrition or starvation. It could also lead to over fishing, destruction of farmland, and deforestation.

Man, I don't know anything about chemistry, but that sounds hard.",0
635,"Based on what's shown in the anime and the manga, plus my own knowledge:    1. Coal    2. Benzene + oxygen + ethylene    3. Urine    4. Salt    5. Phenol + ammonia    6. Sulphuric acid + sodium hydroxide    7. Sulphur trioxide + hydrochloric acid    8. Chlorosulphuric acid + aniline      This is some «NurdRage meets Primitive Technology» kind of stuff.",2
636,"The manga page has more detail, and it  shows aniline coming from coal . Not sure about the exact process.",2
637,"Having good organic chemistry knowledge isn't enough. What he's doing is designing synthetic routes with the random shit he can find laying around. That's mighty hard, and I'm sure the actual consultants who helped the mangaka do it  surely professional chemists  needed to check books and the internet to be sure of every step. Scientists don't usually memorise all this information.",1
638,"Designing synthetic routes isn't that hard; it's something I'd expect from Chemistry undergrads on their second or third year. Senku's brilliance is on the engineering aspect, he's able to pull out replacements for modern apparatus, while most chemists would freeze because they don't get a Bunsen burner or a glass fritter.    I agree the mangaka is consulting professional chemists. There are some simplifications here and there  e.g. urine doesn't  contain  ammonia, but you can produce it from urine , but the process looks too viable to be random.     On coal, you mentioned below: it's just pyrolisis. If you heat mineral coal in an oxygen-free environment you'll be left with coke at one side and tar at the other. Coal tar can be distilled into a bunch of aromatics, among them benzene.     The bitch is doing that without a fractional distillation column. But at least what matters  benzene  is the most volatile of them all, this simplifies a lot of things.",2
639,"Also getting an oxygen-free environment. They don't exactly have sealed tanks to fill with a nitrogen atmosphere  or whatever method is used to do this IRL .    Also, wouldn't undergrads who design synthetic routes still use aids? He's doing all that by memory, that's the amazing bit.    About the engineering, I mean, it's not like this show is very  realistic  in that sense - Senku's equipment always works  way  better than it has any right to. So I'd say that's mostly plot convenience, though the base ideas are still often very clever.",2
640,"     You don't need an inert atmosphere in this case, as long as you're fine with a slightly lower yield. Just a kiln with decent sealing to prevent the whole thing from burning and a retort. In this sense it's a bit like producing moonshine or brandy at home, except instead of booze you're feeding it with coal.    On aids, it depends a lot on the reactions involved, the undergrad himself, and even the environment. If you happen to live in a banana republic and have Organic Chemistry classes with a sadistic professor who demands in exams synthesis routes to produce big arse molecules from nothing but benzene, 1-3 carbon alcohols, and inorganic reagents, well... you end memorizing it. Of course, Senku's situation is nothing like this, but he's curious, intelligent, has interest over the subject, and a good memory.     I agree his hacks work a bit  too  well. Another small issue is luck regarding a certain artisan being a bit  too  good; I won't explore this further to avoid spoiling it for people who don't read the manga, but you probably know who I'm talking about. They're still believable though, unlike people speaking 2019 Japanese 3700 years later.  Another thing I simply brush off due to «rule of fun» ",2
641,"About the artisan, I certainly agree, but really, all characters are just exaggerations and have superpowers that can be described as ""has ability talent X taken to preternatural levels"". Also, the amount of labour they can output is frankly ridiculous. But it's fun, it works, and it allows to make a story about a budding technological civilisation with dozens instead of thousands of characters. Whatever. Even the petrification was after all mainly a plot device to justify the trope of sending a modern boy with scientific knowledge into a stone age setting, all while avoiding any conundrums that would come with making it a literal time travel story. As someone put it... Dr. Stone is an isekai. Kinda.",2

Stuff like Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, are all essential staples of chemistry, but producing them from harvestable stuff isnt easy.

665,"There is actually something that bothers me a bit. A wood foundry may be only able to melt low temperature metal such as cooper, tin, or aluminum, but a coal foundry can reach up to   2300 kelvin. To do so, Senku would typically need to dig a hole in the ground, use the clay to hold a maximum of heat, and burn coal instead of wood. One may say that he wasn't able to do it because it would require to have coal as fuel which can eat his coal stocks, but while we was gathering the iron sand, he could have pyrolyse some wood to make some charcoal just for the foundry. Even though the impurity of the charcoal may produce a lower temperature, it would probably be still higher than the iron melting temperature of   1800 kelvin. And in the case that would not be enough, he could have add more oxygen like he did and increase the heat without requiring more man power.",2
666,"You're confusing  coal .    From Wikipedia:      Charcoal briquettes can burn up to approximately 1,260  C  2,300  F  with a forced air blower forge.",2
667,"Yeah, I didn't have the numbers of the charcoal by heart. But the Wikipedia did mention that charcoal were use in iron melting  section wiki Charcoal Metallurgical fuel .",2
668,"It's an anime, so I don't expect them to be totally accurate scientifically.    In reality, before the use of coal or coke as a fuel, you wouldn't be able to reach the  1500  C to melt metallic iron into pure iron bars  pig iron .  At the temperature of a forced air charcoal furnace, you can however create iron blooms that could then be worked into wrought iron, which is how most ancient civilization created iron implements.    What Senku is likely doing is mimicking how the ancient Chinese first created cast iron way before anyone else, which is by dropping the melting point of iron by adding the charcoal and phosphorus to the magnetite iron sand. By smelting iron with just the right carbon content   4.3% , the iron will liquefy and can be cast at around 1250  C, which is just barely achievable with a forced air charcoal furnace.",2
669,"Senku, the absolute madman. ""We could definitely make penicillin via trial and error with nothing but what we already have, but I choose to make sulfas through a brutally difficult production chain requiring numerous materials we lack including forged iron, because sulfas were made on purpose by science and fuck biologics.""    Edit: I'm not saying he's wrong, I'm just saying it's typical Senku to do the more sciency way compared to ""make bread, leave bread in proper conditions, wait, cull bad results, repeat, wait, make penicillin tea.""",1
670,"It's pretty explicitly explained that he chose to make a sulfa drug over penicillin because making penicillin in time to save Ruri would rely heavily on luck and random chance, whereas a sulfa drug can be synthesized with certainty.",2
671,"I mean, porque no dos?    Hell he's halfway there with flour right?",2
672,"That's like saying that you're halfway there to winning a lottery because you're already in your car on the way to a gas station. The hard part is rolling the hundred-million-sided dice, not the process in die manufacturing.",2
673,"It isn't established how long she's been ill. He doesn't know how long he has. And I maintain that you could probably get to penicillin faster than sulfas in their situation, though it is luck-based.",2
674,"Really it's only the iron that's holding them back. Everything else is just resource gathering and utilizes a level of tech they already have easy access to.    That said I don't see why  other than narrative reasons which is valid  that they wouldn't just start some cultures and start working on the two concurrently. Penicillin is more luck dependent, but not as labor intensive which is currently their limiting factor.",2
675,"Penicillin is so luck intensive that you have a better chance of winning the lottery.    Copy and pasted from a post I made earlier in the thread.    The fungus penicillium is relatively easy to find, but you need a specific kind called penicillium notatum which can produce a decent amount of penicillin. Finding this will be pretty random. Even if you do, you need around 2000 liters of mold culture fluid to create enough penicillin to treat sepsis in just one person. Fully staffed laboratories in a large industrialized country like America struggled to make enough to treat just a few people. In 1942 there was only enough penicillin in the entire country to treat 10 people. Through pure chance, one of the scientists happened upon a moldy cantaloupe in Peoria, Illinois with a strain of penicilium notatum that had 200 times the yield of penicillin, called penicillium chrysogenum. This was furthered mutated with x rays and other processes until it produced 1000 times the yield of normal penicillium notatum. Modern variations are even more advanced.    The end result is that producing Penicillin in a stone world would be practically impossible. You better hope that you stumble upon penicillium chrysogenum which is a mutated penicillium notatum that only existsed on that single cantaloupe for all we know, and even so without further mutation with x rays the yield is pretty low.    A sulfate based antibiotic is absolutely the way to go.",2
676,"Yeah, it was so difficult to produce that they collected the urine of treated patients to reuse the penicillin.",2
677,"I’d argue that the methods to cultivate the mold which were being developed at the same time were as important, and those cultivation methods are reproducible by Senku. We’re also talking about the end use of treating a single patient. Put those together and it’s not as far fetched as needing a rare high-yield strain much less a genetically engineered one.     That said I still agree with you if you had to choose between the two. My point was that they really didn’t have to nor should they. Sulfa drugs aren’t without their drawbacks which is why most developed countries tend to avoid their use and penicillin took over in the mid 1900’s. Namely sulfa antibiotics have more side effects and are generally less effective. Especially a basic one like Senku will be able to synthesize with what’s available to him.     Narratively we know they’ll win some people over and get the manpower to make the iron they need. So from a narrative standpoint it makes sense to ignore what will be the dead end. Even without that someone with Senku’s knowledge should be capable of whipping up a basic engine, water wheel, or some other device to do the bulk of the physical labor for you. It’s also unlikely that Ruri will have any negative drawbacks and the drug will either work perfectly if it’s treatable by antibiotics or not at all if it’s not pending on which direction the author takes the narrative.     In a real world case just grow some dam mold so you’ve got a head start to purifying a strain in case your sulfa project doesn’t work out. That part of the process is practically no effort, and costs next to nothing in terms of resources. It’s just leaving medium out in a variety of locations for mold to grow on to pick up as much variety as you can. By the time you’d have to put actual effort into it to isolate strains you’ll either have hit some road block on the sulfa, or it’ll have panned out and you can just scrap the penicillin project for other more immediate goals.",2
678,"All this only works if you have managed to convince people to help you farm molds, in an age where most of them probably can't tell how one mold looks different from another, and the lack of biological equipment like microscope to even study the mold strain. There is a reason why it took so long before enzyme became something common in industrial usage, such as tenderizing and fabic softeners - the precision needed for specific biological components require very advanced technology and research time investment.    Within the limited scientific argument we can make, there is no real advantage in making penicillin for Senku's gang, no matter how promising the benefits it bring  if by chance, it worked .",2
679,"1. You wouldn’t differentiate green mold through morphology to determine if it’s a usable strain. You can’t tell one strain of a penicillin bacteria that is usable from one that isn’t just based on its morphology. You’d use an agar plate and check its anti-bacterial potency similarly to how Fleming first discovered penicillin. While microscopy would help expedite the process by allowing you to cut out anything that has mimicry on a macro level it isn’t necessary.     2. While getting a pure antibiotic would be nearly impossible with the materials available for extraction it would still be an effective treatment since you could concentrate it into an effective dose. The same can also be said of the sulfa drugs he’ll make. It’ll have a bunch of junk in it, but it’ll work.",2
680,"1. The use of agar plate itself is another supporting example of difficult equipmrnt necessary to be able to even manufacture even a bit of penicillin. Regardless of the specific equipment, the point still stands that the technology required to even validate if a sample is the desired penicillin costs more time, is more difficult and less chance of successfully healing Ruri than the sulfa alternative    2. The argument is not about effectiveness of the drug itself against the illness. If it was, we wouldn't be debating it here. It was the effectiveness of manufacturing and curing Ruri's illness within the limited time, resources and equipment, both aspects which the penicillin route either cannot outperform sulfa  effective manufacturing, equipment feasibility  or is outright not feasible at all  due to the very basis that the possibility of even finding a good strain is not a guaranteed and very low rate of success     To even argue further, saying that penicillin is less difficult to make than sulfa antibiotic because of the hard labout is not even a point. Both are extremley difficult to make, because in Senku's situation there is no convenient way to do them. So the success of being able to manufacture it becomes the most rational option, in which sulfa antibitoic wins the case.",2
681,I'd argue that it's more due to the penicillin route requiring a bunch of luck to find a suitable strain in the very limited sample size they'd have. They could hardly search for mold all over the planet. Meanwhile the sulfas route may be harder but is ultimately a guaranteed path to success and the numerous requirements along the way are generally of use anyhow.,2
682,"Penicillium can be grown wild just by leaving bread on the countertop anywhere in the world, it's  ""ubiquitous in soil"" . Sulfas are definitely way harder to make in comparison, they require all those intermediate steps in the flowchart. Senku is a 'maximum effort' sorta guy.",2
683,     There's no way they'd get lucky enough to find a strain of penicillin effective enough to make enough antibiotics to cure even one person.,1
684,Thats pretty much pure luck to come across a moldy cantaloupe and knowing it is useful,1
685,"In the previous episode thread someone said penicilin was made from a very specific fruit they found in another country. So it's not just ""hard"" to do, it's probably extremely unlikely to happen at all.    Besides, by researching sulfas you get to unlock iron. Now you have entered the iron age.",2
686,"u ManchurianCandidate7's answer is excellent, so just adding a small tidbit to highlight how random penicillin would be to get:    We got penicillin discovered because one guy called Alexander Fleming was studying bacteria. He decided to go on vacations and, when returning, one of his culture plates had mould. That strain of mould was only able to settle in because, by a stroke of luck, it was able to produce enough penicillin to invade a culture plate filled with the bacteria.",1
687,"That's nonsense, you can find penicillin in the dirt throughout most of the world.",0
688,I don't know which random redditor to trust : ,2
689,"The answer is inbetween. The fungus penicillium is relatively easy to find, but you need a specific kind called penicillium notatum which can produce a decent amount of penicillin.

690,"Thanks, that clarifies it!",1
691,Wow! Thanks for the info,1
692,"I sorta thought the same originally, but I'm okay with going the harder route, mostly because a small number of people can exhibit dangerous or deadly side affects with penicillin and they can't really be tested monitored for potential reaction safely with the current level of tech.    AFAIK sulpha drugs are safer, if less effective, albeit there's still the trial and error risk of not manufacturing it safely  enough , something that's going to happen regardless of the drug type manufactured until they're much further advanced.    e: sulphure to sulpha",1
693,"The side effects is something I forgot to consider, you're right that 'cillin allergies are relatively common.",2
694,Sulfate based antibiotics are much easier to make than to acquire enough penicillin to heal even just one person.,2
695,They just have to hope Ruri doesn't have a sulfa allergy.,1
696,"People can be allergic to sulfa  I am , but I don't know how the seriousness compares to bad reactions to penicillin.",2
697,"I don't didn't know either - a quick google suggests about the same range of adverse reaction from either type.    Further checking may require me to rethink my opinion: I had based my initial reply on having previously learned  due to my own penicillin allergy  that  10% of people could be allergic to penicillin, vs.  2 to 3% of sulpha users  hence why I said ""safer"" - not ""safe"" :      However, apparently recently studies of previous studies re: penicillin allergies suggest that most reports were self-reports by patients who were told they were allergic long ago  like myself , and that a lot of said self-reporting may be invalid later in life  never had it, or had it to a much lesser extent than believed, or grew out of it quickly , bringing the probable actual ""severe reaction"" patients down to  1%.    Penicillin, then, is at least statistically safer by a tiny margin, and acts better in a broader spectrum of cases, but as others have noted, it's also a crapshoot as to how to find the right variant and cultivate it sufficiently.     So I guess I'd still give the nod to sulphas just because, while complex to manufacture relatively speaking, he seems to have a good grasp of the entire process and is confident he can produce it with local ingredients and current tech  with assists by his own ""inventions"", like the bellows they all used with the furnace. ",2
698,"It's more about «let's not rely on random chance, let's do it in a slow but sure way». I agree with him.    Plus he has good Chemistry knowledge, and odds are he does remember sulphamide structure. Elaborating a synthesis route in this case is trivial:      Get benzene from coal tar. You need coal, not charcoal.    React benzene with ethylene  rotting fruits?  and oxygen to get phenol.  Cumene process. Goddammit why do I still remember this shit?  I think other hydrocarbons are viable here, but they need a double bond.     React phenol with ammonia, get aniline.     Hydrolize salt to get sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid.    React sulphuric acid with sodium hydroxide, get sodium bisulphate.    Heat sodium bisulphate, get sulphur trioxide.  Kinda a convoluted way, but doable if you just have the acid but not the oxide.     React sulphur trioxide with hydrochloric acid, get chlorosulphuric acid.    React chlorosulphuric acid with aniline, get para-sulphonamide.     The only problem here is that you're expected to get some ortho-sulphonamide mixed in, I don't know if it has the same properties as the para- isomer. I think it does, but if it doesn't, no fucking way Senku would be able to distil them apart.",2
699,"The coal is a larger obstacle then anything else in the list. Surface deposits would have been all used up by Japan's industry, leaving only deeper inaccessible deposits, I'd imagine. Other than that it's totally doable  and I'm excited to see the scene where he tells them exactly where one gets ammonia with their resources .",2
700,"Not all surface deposits were explored. Some of them are simply too small to bother, on an industrial scale - but those can be used by Senku just fine.",2
701,"Also he gets to acquire all the intermediates, which could turn useful anyway in future projects. Sulfuric acid alone is a pretty basic chemical precursor.",2
702,The facial expressions were off the charts this episode.,1
703,Suika is here and she looks cute.    Wonder if Naruto would taste that ramen.,1
704,Chitoge versus kohaku— who is the better gorilla?,1
705,"The soundtrack is so good. The antibiotic , The suika spy and the Ramen eating soundtrack is soo good",1
706,"Damn, I really dig Kohaku voice, it fit her perfectly. Also Suika is here! Yey!",1
707,They still have bikinis in stone age. Who knew!,1
708,The facial expressions this episode were top notch,1
709,Could someone write me a spoiler whether is it going to be explained why Suika wears that thing on her head? And how does she look without it?,2
710,It will be explained very soon.,2
711,Yes and it is one of the best moments in the story,1
712,"Yeah, when I first saw her in the OP, I guessed it would have something to do with her depetrification, but it seems nobody in the village even knows that's possible.",1
713,"No one in the village seems depetrified either, so either there's an improved version of the fluid that leaves no cracks or everyone was born in the stone world.",2
714," ""She's nearsighted, so she scrunches a lot and this made people to find her creepy and ugly, although she's a cute kid. Eventually Senku will make her glasses... but she'll still use them with the pumpkin because she's already used to it.""     And we were already introduced to another character with something similar as Suika. This one I won't spoil, just as a tease.",1
715,It amazes me on how Senku knows all this stuff. He must have a lot of general knowledge.,1
716,"Anyone out there with Crunchyroll having issues trying to actually watch the episode? Maybe its my phone, hmm...     Excited for this new episode!",1
717,first 2min is like 144p lol.    Been like that for couple weeks atleasg for me,1
718,Yarr harr fiddle dee dee pirating anime has no problems for me,2
719,"I keep having issues on my phone, but on my desktop I haven't.    Last time I had issues with the tail end of Accelerator and Symphogear.",2
720,"For whatever reason, I'm getting ads when I have my adblocker running.",2
721,"and so now the tutorial has officially ended,the first main quest can begin...",2
722,"An simple but important question here.     Do they know of Salt? Perhaps Senku forgot to put Salt in the Ramen    in everyday Food salt is really important. Do they know of this?    edit: Oh, i was to late : ",2
723,"Watch a few episodes back, Senku salted the mushrooms while he and Taiju ate their first meal.",2
724,But does the village know?,2
725,Chrome poured salt in the fire last episode to make his trick,2
726,"But do they know it's edible, or is it just a rock to them?",2
727,The salt Chrome poured into fire is not edible table salt. That was mineral salt which have specific metals that cause colorful flames when burned,2
728,The problem was that the noodles were made out of a millet not normally used. Inedible for him but still flour.,2
729,I tought that senku was going to extract msg from seaweed or something like that and make every food really tasty.,2
730,"Everyone:  gathering iron sand   Suika: ""Kept you waiting, huh?""",2
731,"I feel that the episodes are too short , I wanted to finish this season first before reading the manga , but this rate idk if I can wait anymore",1
732,Read the manga coveredby the anime. Its so fast paced in the anime that you may miss out some details,1
733,"Yo, Last episode cross the 9 points !",1
734,I swear i love that face expressions !,1
735,This show is the most interesting shounen among all the new ones this season,1
736,this is anime so good it finish to fast,1
737,     I just noticed something that maybe someone more familiar with japanese local culture may be able to answer - the tune that Suika is playing on the ocarina really sounds like the tune that Yui plays when  she's starting out on the guitar  and I always thought it was just a funny tune she played. But it's actually a real thing? lol,1
738,"It's the traditional ramen cart theme called Charummela. I'm not sure if that's the actual name, but people call it that because ramen vendors traditionally play it on a ciaramella  a sort of flute .    It's used just like ice cream trucks play turkey in the straw.",1
739,Amazing TIL thanks very much! 10 year mystery solved.,1
740,Wow. Thanks for sharing. Was imagining what sound it make when i read the manga,1
741,at least not breakman one  ? ,2
742,An episode every week is making it painful. I want to read the manga but I also want to resist...,1
743,"If Taiju didn't even get to eat a bowl a ramen, why did Senku even bother reviving him.",0
744,It's so great Dr. Stone and Neverland both get popular adaptations this year,1
745,"Wow, each week I love how the power-system is just basic science so much.  Also, surprisingly learned something  antibiotics out of rocks , which makes me question the US education system.    And can my trashy shipper soul pray for Kohaku to be Senku’s waifu? I know it won’t happen cuz of his personality, but damn she’s so cute.",1
746,Reminded me of food wars,1
747,Yeah it also did remind me a little of Soma with the food of part this episode. :D,1
748,Shokugeki no Senku,2
749,Which chapter?,2
750,Start at chapter 23 to continue from the end of this episode.,2
751,Thanks!,1
752,I typically follow one show at a time. I have definitely found my jojo replacement. Anyone know how many episodes this season?,1
753,"This is 2 cour show, so 24 25 episodes for this first season.",2
754,Dope,1
755,Wait Ayla's was disowned! What the hell is that about? Though I admit she does seem to be the free spirited type who plays by her own rules.      So Suika intends to wear a watermelon rind into adulthood? Your gonna need some bigger rinds there kid.      Hmm. Stories from ages past are indeed being past down. Albeit with some changes be it deliberate or muddled by time. Curious. What does this mean?      And winning over the people with the power of cooking. Senku knows how to please. His noodle cart is gonna be a smashing success.,1
756,Chrome the Incel lol,1
757,Me so hungry,2
758,We a cooking show now?,2
759,Is it just me or does anyone else think the ED looks like the music video to ICP miracles?,2
760,The Expressions this episode were top-notch,2
761,Now how the fuck are you gonna tell me she can fit into a watermelon,1
762,She smol,2
763,Anime,2
764,basically she's very smol,2
765,"She pulls her arms and legs in real close to her body, and then sucks it up into the melon, like ""shump!""",2
766,fun episode is fun,1
767,"Dr Stone was a cooking anime all along!    Suika is super cute, and there is also a cute dog!",1
768,Fucking love this episode. Suika is cute,1
769,Dr. Stone is a cooking anime.,2
770,I love how scientific this show is,1
771,I don't know why I always get excited seeing characters react to things they've never seen or tried,1
772,Figure of Senku in a lab coat when?,2
773,Where are all the reaction face images?,2
774,Man just watching Senkuu and the gang make food was so much fun. I really like Suika design and seeing her spying on the village as a watermelon was a good use for her.,1
775,  jojo  shiny monkey friday!,1
776,How do you actually make antibiotics from stone?,2
777,"Look up ""sulfonamides."" It's a different type than what's typically discussed, but they work.",2
778, whoever's doing these subtitles are doing some quality work ,1
779,I hadn't even thought of what happened to all the pets before a puppy showed up,1
780,"Not sure how long it would take to undomesticate an entire species, but dogs have been working with humans for thousands of years. Chances are that the puppy is at least tamed or that kind of subservience to humanity is still within the species.",2
781,Dosent it feel like Senku is actually talking to you when hes explaining things or is that just me?,2
782,"Ramen, foundation of the scientific kingdom.               Truly a work of science",2
783,That roadmap looks insane! I wonder what the roadmaps of future inventions will look like.,1
784,The power of Ramen compels you!!,1
785,this is literally minecraft the show and i love it,1
786,This show really got so much better once he go to the village! Big fan of this arc,1
787,Love this anime lolll,1
788,Went into this show blind.. and surprisingly I ended up liking it.  Not many post apocalyptical anime out there and this seems cool. Only problem I have is with the girls.. they have such derpy looking eyes haha  and maybe also Senku's hairstyle lol .,1
789,i like how the chopstick holding technique has changed,1
790,Episode 8 adapted 3 chapters  20-22 . I really hope they did adapt the side story at the end of chapter 22 though.     Here's the side story if anyone's interested ,2
791,"Yo how are these 3 sisters always lazing around at the beach like damn this is a community, they should at least be washing clothes or something if they're going to the beach    Make tiny-post-apocalyptic-primitive tribe great again",2
792,What's the name of that music Suika plays with her flute at the end of the episode?,2
793,Isn't it due to relativity rather than gravity that she isn't flung off the branch?    also    Suika is the best character.,2
794,"Gravity keeps her on the ground. If you've held someones feet while spinning around  maybe a small child  you'll notice that they start levitating a little bit, but if you let go they'll fly away  and probably get injured .     Basically the same principle. Without gravity holding you to the ground, you'd probably fly away. What has relativity got to do with it?",2
795,"They're talking about the fact that earth is spinning which is spinning at around 1600 km h . And shes asking why she isn't flung away since earth is spinning, and that is due to relativity.",2
796,"I guess we could get a bit philosophical and say that is general relativity since that one is pretty much another way to look at gravity too along with other interactions, but on the scales we are dealing with the reason is that the Earth spins at a constant velocity with practically no acceleration, we would feel the change and start getting tossed around if the Earth suddenly started to go faster or slowed down.",2
797,"Relativity isn't actually a ""thing,"" it's more of a philosophy of describing things. Gravity is the force that is keeping her down. if the Earth were hollowed out so that it had no real force of gravity, but still spun at the same speed, then it would fling people off due to spin. If you stopped its spin as well, but it still rotated around the Sun  again, with essentially zero gravitational force pulling you down , then both the Earth and the people on it would be pulled out of orbit by momentum and fly out of the solar system. The people would stay roughly near the Earth in that case, because their motions would be similar, but the basic forces keeping the Earth spinning around the sun are gravity trying to mash the Earth into the sun, and rotational velocity keeping the Earth from falling inward.",2
798,     What?,2
799,"Shokugeki no Senku!!    Senku’s a scientist so I’m not surprised there weren’t any foodgasms. However, once we get a cook to join the Kingdom of Science I want the three beautiful girls going  with Senku pulling his ",1
800,Where is the episode where they finally make condoms?,2
801,  This episode was a lot rushed but looking at it carefully there was no little story progress at the end of the day.              Why most of the villagers are blonde?,1
802,"new character introduced, they found iron and made a way to get more citizens for science nation. how is that no story progress lmao.",1
803,Look carefully.,1
804,lmao do you think story progress is fighting with tsukasa? instead of reviving civilization?,1
805,I didn't say that. But it's okay now!,1
806,"The same reason why Senku's hair dye hasn't come out after 5000 years, and never shows dark roots.",2
807,inb4 the reason suika wears the melon is because half of her face is just gone or something,2
808,Like whitebeard? = ,1
809,The reason why the ramen was bad was probably because he forgot the alkaline part.,2
810,He added it: potassium carbonate. It's just the grain he was using isn't that suitable for this.,1
811,Oh ok nvm. I wasn’t really paying attention.,1
812,"Well even Wikipedia is missing in part the First Chinese Empire production of Titanium Steel even though one of ""magical swords"" they no longer knew how to make showed up in Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.   But the first part of making cast iron in the process is well documented. Unfortunately our hero does not even know that.   I have seen a in depth documentary on it but fast research not fining but hints at the higher quality steel from the process where Pig Iron would be converted to steel.   Wikipedia does have the piston billows part though but only mentions it's use for cast Iron. Britannica does mention the high quality steel production but in quite short.    It use a piston billows were a square board piston on a rod was moved in a rectangles tube with valves into the fire and valves for outside air. Moving this rod back and forth could be done by man power or water power like the Chinese Did. As piston moved in one direction the intake to the fire valve opened with the air intake on that side closed. Then it reversed with outside air valve opened and fire valve that side closed and the other side valves switching. This allowed continuous air blowing instead of the only half the time air blowing of traditional billows and thus allowing much higher temperatures to be reached. The next part of the process the Chinese lost though and that is not the only Chinese invention they have lost over their history a tragedy of the culture where great advancements were made but then stagnated and many were lost or never developed much with normally no outside interference involved.   Still be a problem here though in these conditions as the process also depended on special Brick Ovens that could take Blast furnance iron temperatures and I see mention of a special clay glaze on the inside walls.",1
813,"This anime makes no sense, for real, each episode is worse than the last one.. Suika disappear in a watermelon and Senku has absolutely 0 reaction ? I mean wth I know this is anime and shit, but try to make sense.. also « we’re going to blow on the flame for 10 hours » ???? Ahahahah this is crazy..",0
