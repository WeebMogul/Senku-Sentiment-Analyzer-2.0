0,I can't wait until chapter 115 gets animated. Byakuya is the best dad in manga anime for me.,1
1,That chapter fucking killed me.,1
2,You are not alone. That one put him really up there as of of the best parents.,1
3,"For some strange reason, I didn't get emotional about the founding of Ishigami Village. Might be because it was ""eventual"" in the back of my mind.    But the glass record? That was mad brilliant    And the platinum? That was really touching. Senku touching on the difficulty of the task before expounding on the sum result really hammered it home for me.",1
4,Also where do y’all think they’ll leave off? After the tsukasa fight?,2
5,"Definitely not, 7 episodes left is too little    My take is up to Ch 66 or 67. ie After the cellphone business is ""done"" to a point    Here, phone is delivered to Taiju and Yuzuriha; Nicky is recruited; Chrome is captured and Senku gives the marching order to Ishigami Village while preparing to make a car. It may be mid-arc, but it's a good stopping point actually.",1
6,Damn so it’ll need at least 3 seasons,2
7,"Well, they could probably wrap the war in another 12 eps after that, and then maybe build up to the treasure island arc by the end of a second 24 eps.",1
8,So the two who went to the find medicine are the ancestors to the Islanders we are currently fighting now?,2
9,"No, they most likely died on the way. The people in Ishigami village are travelers from the astronaut island thousands of years later.    Edit: just realized you meant the treasure island. In that case yes.",2
10,Can’t wait to see current island arc adapted,1
11,"  Original comment by  u SI7Rus |  Parent comment   r anime comments dmy9sy dr stone episode 17 discussion f56lf4l      ---    Firearms are for kids. I don't know if you read the manga, so I'm not giving exact details but if senku really wanted to kill tsukasa he'd be dead within days. It's only gonna get crazy from here. Get excited lol    ---     This message was posted by a bot because originally submitted  outside of the Source Material Corner. ",3
12,Possible location of Astronaut Island according to the official translator is at Hachijo-Kojima     ,2
13,"I mean the disc was discovered during the  ""Cellphone arc when they make the speaker"" ",2
14,"Oh, so it's later. I thought it was right after they visit the cemetery.",2
15,"So I guess the two who took the boat to the mainland never came back? I never really paid it that much mind when I first read it, but that seems to be what happens here?",2
16,The real question is why did they BOTH go... they were both doctors too... NotLikeThis.,2
17,Now that you mention it! I am wondering too!,1
18,"They realized that having kids is hell, dipped to the mainland to enjoy all the luxuries left behind, and for some  other business  as well..        datass ",1
19,"  This whole past flashback  arc is maddening as hell screws up everything that we assumed logically happened      The whole point of the anime is that -      ok that the jojo character of master enemy was one over the top exaggeration, but at least we had it only for 2 episodes and disappeared which is also a good and really bad thing it its own      But then we got back to logical deductive Sherlockian stuff     -And now we have that 6 dudes repopulated earth    Wait not 6 actually only 4 in the end? cuz in their universe astronauts are not filled up with antibiotics reserves when go to space...      -On the other side of the world, cuz they clearly said in south america...    So how the fuck they got in japan on one island only? they only spoke of it at end barely but not rly matches  up with what we got here now     ;    At least we got it why half the girls have weird strabism  eyes if not hereditary cuz yah their ancestors had same shit ""design"" for eyes .          inbreading does that to you...       if even wasn't hereditary       so yah one thing is logically plausible finally!",1
20,ok lets start    6 people can definitely repopulate the earth.    international space station = large gene pool  actually larger genepool the native populations of the world. aboriginals. native americans etc actually had a smaller genepool so surprise  senku would be more related to gen then to kohaku even if byaku was his blood father.    and also a small gene pool  and by extension inbreeding  wouldn't affect humans nearly as badly as other animals.    biggest issue is environmental changes screwing over the population as no indivuals have a trait to survive the environmental change well humans solved this issue   we are not built to handle cold at all but we made clothes  our ability to make stuff and build shelter fixes this issue.    now issues with inbreeding. surprisingly the show accidently  or on purpose  covered their bases really well.  As long as the parents are not predisposed to genetic illnesses.birth defects are actually really unlikely. also the chances of genetic disorders appearing via inbreeding is way exaggerated assume u had a clone that was genetically identical to you but female  only the sex chromosome changed  say your have an avg predisposure to genetic disorders and you fucked said clone and had a child. your chances of having a totally normal baby is 999 1000 99.9% NANI YEP totally fine. this is a 20   increase in chance but its still 20   a really small chance. now breeding between siblengs increases the chance of a child suffering genetic disorders by 10   so 1999 2000 babies will be healthy.     ;    wow right     ;    then consider that astronauts are all genetically screened for any genetic illness that appears more then once in 100000 births. that base is pretty damn well covered.     ;    now if you pay attention the shamil guy said that the best bet is to land in japan and thats what they tried to do. instead he missed so plans changed and they needed o get to an island instead chances are future generations slowly island hopped to japan thanks to the stories left behind,2
21,"Almost everything you said sounds convincing except the last bit is wrong. Byakuya said he was aiming for South America to figure out what caused the petrification, but they missed by a great distance, though this distance probably means they landed in the sea near South America, not Japan. They got to an island near South America and Byakuya somehow planned the future generations going to Japan with his stories.",1
22,No they decided in the end that they would gp fpr japan a large margin dosent mean the opposite side of the world lmao,1
23,"Just checked, byakuya says he's going to South America and then the older blonde guy is trying to convince him to go to Japan. Since there's no line suggesting he changed his mind, it probably means they agreed on South America as the target.",2
24,Go to the 7 min mark and they said they landed on the island which was farthest away from the petrification beam which originated in South America,2
25,"No, in the subs I watched it said they 'missed by a great distance'. Doesn't mean it was the other side of the world.",2
26,Weren't they discussing that maybe in places far away from the origin of the petrification people were still alive?    I think it was in Japan since when they saw a person after they landed then thought he was still alive for a split second because they were in Japan but after seeing the person still petrified they gave up hope about anyone else being alive as they were in Japan.,2
27,"I watched twice and this is what I got:    -     -     -     -     -     I think that means they landed in the sea around South America, dunno. There's nothing concrete saying they landed in Japan. In fact, Byakuya said something about trying to get them close to Senku with the stories, so it sounds like they aren't very close to Senku Japan. They can migrate that far over 3700 years, they have just enough knowledge of the past to help them.",2
28,"Not sure about anime, but in the manga it states they landed on an uninhabited island ""as far from the light source as possible""",2
29,"Oh, that sort of clears things up. But didn't Byakuya say something about sending his descendants Senku's way?",1
30,yes but its pretty damn hard to get from south america to japan thats literally on the other side of the world also massive ass continent to miss and islands would be one hell of a stretch away given context they chose to land on japan. shamil is the one who ended up going down first so chances are he had the final say in where to land,2
31,"I know, but it's possible over 3700 years. Maybe Byakuya instructed them to migrate and they did so bit by bit.",2
32,3700 years isnt long enough to get to the other side of the world. They dont have the stuff they need to make it that far.  Boats  also islands arent is south america  thats one hell of a landmass to miss  if they where aiming for that they wouldnt miss ,2
33,"Eh, I don't get why they can't make boats over 3+ millennia. We didn't see boats in the village but that doesn't mean they never had any. They may have some near the beach.    There's also a number of complications that could come from just 6 astronauts going to South America without any support or communication from HQ. Missing that wouldn't be so difficult. Guess we'll just have to wait and see if there's more in later episodes.",2
34,3700 years is not enough for humanity to progress from rafts to ships,2
35,They punch lions to death in this anime.,2
36,A man has killed a bear bare handed at the cost of his life. Also a lions body is designed to tank scratches and bites not blunt force trauma. Tsukasa probably just barely scrapes over the edge of peak human. Assuming he is as strong as the strongest humans it is viable  albeit he would have to be at peak strength  if he struck one of the 3 weakest parts of a lions skull he could severely injure it. Probably not kill it without being at least semi superhuman but he could definitely being a lion down.,2
37,"It's a big fucking stretch, okay. I'm not convinced they're gonna stick to 'building ships over 3.7k years is impossible' so much. Doesn't have to be a huge ship or the Titanic.",0
38,has to be good enough to get across half the freaking planet. it needs to belarge enough to carry enough people to start the village and the food and stuff needed to last the 3 moth + journey    humans took over 100 000 years to upgrade from rafts to ships that could sail more then a week    also all evidence points to them landing near japan.    otherwise they would have encountered civilisation and reverse engineered some of the technology by then.    yes a human taking down a lion is one hell of a stretch its doable  by that i mean non 0 chance  and if tsukasa is peak human yeah he can mayyybe do it realistically it will be a more drawn out fight and the lion will actually peace the fuck out  lions dont like risk  i mean tsukasa is massive and has the strongest teenager title,1
39,"again, the same generation doesn't have to go that far. They only have to go the nearest country by sea, and the next generation can go a little more. They can even go half the distance by land. I think this writer is okay with that much liberty taken in writing.",2
40,Yes but from one country to another they still need a ship that can last a month and every single one needs to hold enough to start a village. Now as much as the starting 6 is viabe. If you take 6 of their descendents and repeatedly do that genetics will fuck u hard,0
41,Not ocer 3700 years without a proper boat. No shipwrights in the village. Its downright impossible otherwise they would have gone past civilisation in that time and adopted the technology,2
42,"     right of the bat, gonna stop u there      LOL NO      read any google article u cansearch for      how did you even got so fast to this comment? alternative accounts? cuz u not the dude from above and dropped a WOT in no time     ;    6 ppl he says.. pfft",0
43,earth = = mars i confirmed it with a geneticist  my cousin 20 years in the profession  6 people is definitely enough just because humans are a special case,2
44,"u forget the part about them being there 3k years? make a tree root    ppl there have a new generation each 20 years kinda    3 pairs, keep dragging them down how many of them and how much they intersect in that time, thats a genetic bomb waiting to explode with defects way way before the 3k mark",2
45,Read my whole cpmmet from earlier i womt repeat myself,2
46,     ya well.. womt you too!    wotm you too!,2
47,phone typing on a freaking train lmao,1
48,Its not nearly as bad as ur making it sound lol humans are an exception to alot of population and generic rules because we are pretty much immune to environmental changes. Genetic illness disease and stuff can hurt a population with low genetic diversity but the killing blow is always something changing in the environment that no one can survive because they are not built for it.     We could theoretically repopulate the earth with only 1 pair if no current infrastructure is lost. Not reliably but sure as hell is doable. In fact if all of us where clones  excluding sex chromosomes  as long as we werent pre disposed to disease our race would be fine.    The mars website u linled takes into account the professions we need to be able to pull it off and the difficulty of space travel. I read ir wholr post just go back to my prigonal and read the whole thing i consulted a 20 year geneticist for this information,2
49,also to answer the last question im a completely different person who has 32 cousins all of them working in the science field i myself am a chemist,2
50,  Shocked  Pikachu     on that revelations clearly,1
51,that number is for space travel and drops a fuckton of assumptions and the simulation ran is better applied to animals    humans cover alot of their own weaknesses read the whole thing.,2
52,w    a    t,2
53,"It's a dangerous trip, so you need more then one person and if you send both doctors they can split up on the safe mainland and search for useful stuff even faster.       alternatively they knew they'd likely die and didn't want to leave each other behind      Whatever medical procedures they could do without tools medicine are likely already common knowledge for the other astronauts",2
54,The first point of splitting up and searching for useful items can be done by anyone maybe but the second point that they didn't want to leave each other's side make more sense to me at least! And probably the case!,1
55,im like 100 00000000 % sure astronauts carry up with them their pills    antibiotics included..    Major Tom would not lie about that would he?    They even made a song about it!,2
56,Ahh now I can frame this season's ending,1
57,"Well, they are wife and husband. You can't always be that logical.",1
58,Doctors without their tools are useless.,1
59,I mean.. senku is no doctor but he cured kohaku’s sister without anything to begin with so,2
60,"I disagree, he derived an antibiotic from natural means because he’s a scientist, not a doctor. A doctor can only diagnose and prescribe, they cannot heal without things to diagnose with and things to prescribe. That’s why they risked their lives in search of an antibiotic",1
61,"Damn, this is actually very accurate. Thx for explaining, I’m joining your side now",1
62,"     This is a bit of a cop out, he's basically a doctor with the knowledge he has.  A scientist isn't necessarily going to know that what Ruri had was pneumonia based on the symptoms, that's entirely in the realm of medical knowledge.  Senku is merely an insanely smart polymath.",1
63,"There’s a phrase in the episode that I think defines the whole arc: “humanity forgets that which it doesn’t need”. Medical textbooks don’t detail alternative treatments, they specify that the doctor prescribe an antibiotic  which we assume to be both plentiful and cheap . Doctors also aren’t expected to be able to synthesize their own medicines, that’s a pharmacists job. So a doctor in Stone world is next to useless, their knowledge is outdated and insufficient.     Senku on the other hand has internalized hundreds of years of scientific knowledge. He knows the base formula and how to derive it from. He’s not a doctor in the sense that he lacks the specialized knowledge and finesse that comes from med school, but when it comes to how chemicals react with the body he knows all there is.",1
64,"Holy shit, haha. Imagine actually thinking people go through a fucking decade of medical school to learn how to prescribe what a book says to prescribe, what a joke.    And surgeons are useless too, right? Just cutting on the dotted line where the book tells them to like preschoolers with construction paper? Rofl.     The realm of medicine is a lot deeper than just the practice of diagnosis, dude. There are doctors who specialize in it known as diagnosticians, but you're basically saying that doctors didn't need to exist before penicillin was discovered, which is asinine.  To suggest doctors are not necessary because the world has lost most of its medical advancements is borderline absurdity, are you being serious?    Senku is isekai-mc levels of OP in this show. He's basically a doctor, a scientist in applied chemistry, biology, physics, materials Science, etc. That you actually think they wouldn't have use for someone with his level of medical knowledge without the ability to synthesize antibiotics is completely and utterly dismissing the importance of medical experts entirely. You know so little about the world of medicine that you don't even know how little you know.",1
65,"It’s like you purposely didn’t read what I said. What use is the most precise heart surgeon in Stone World? The common cold would kill people before they ever would need surgery, the lack of antiseptic means any surgery will lead to infection, and lack of anesthetic means surgery in Stone World is agony; to put it bluntly doctors in Stone World are worse than a Civil War field hospital.     The main day to day job of doctors is to prescribe medication, their training is mostly focused on identifying the illness and prescribing the right medication and or treatment. This works because we live in a society. Take away that society and what can a doctor do? The answer is nothing, because we are confident that we will always live in a society.     Honestly if the doctor couple could get their hands on a chemistry book they might be able to synthesize the drugs they need, but on a small low tech island void of modern medical supplies they can do nothing beyond simple field dressings.    It’s like you think Doctors are magical people who can heal no matter the circumstance. Next time you go in for a physical count be number of medical tools they use on you.",0
66,     Quality  r iamverysmart material.,0
67,Dunning-Kruger effect,2
68,Probably because they the only one that knows what to look for.,2
69,"They were doctors but they were also without tools technology medicine. They had the highest chance of finding the medicine that they needed to bring back since they would know what they were looking for and what they would need for the future. That's how I look at it. In a world without those essential tools, a doctor is as good as a field medic which I'm sure all of them had basic training for.",2
70,"Because they are doctors, not pharmacists. A doctor's job is to prescribe medicine and perform operations using tools,without these tools they are more or less as good as a field medic, which I'm sure all the astronauts are trained to be adpet at.",2
71,"The buddy system is the smart choice. This wasn't meant to be a sacrifice play, they both went because they wanted the best chances for both of them to come back.",1
72,What if that becomes a future plot point. They left but couldn't make it back due to some circumstances and now their descendants are a seperate village country that Senku's gonna come into conflict with some day.,2
73,Bro for their situation they are being as stupid as possible. Why the fuck would they stay on the island in the first place? Immediately go to a population center and take advantage of all the tools and facilities. Or say fuck it fly somewhere better for your situation. For a group of people who are supposed to be some of the best and brightest they made nothing but bad decisions.,0
74,"To be fair... of what we saw in the first episode it was an absolute disaster. Planes nose diving out of the sky, zoo animals running wild, etc.",2
75,"Find a gun, fly to a city that's more intact, do whatever. You have two top tier doctors and some supposedly smart astronauts. Go to a city, get equipment and resources and see if you can make any headway on figuring out how to cure people. Sitting on an island waiting to die is not helping anyone get unpetrified.",2
76,But Senku is gonna unpetrify and save everyone any time soon!,1
77,The real question is this Is it possible that if senku could have counted brain functioned thus he was still living like all the petrified people ? So he is growing in years petrified not by actual body structure . So he is like an old man bount or something . Also so many years have passed and no black or gay people appeared . That is racism . Also first thing is to spread across the globe using all that earth chan can provide you with . Not just stick to a single village .,2
78,"That's what I got from that too. Which means either they died, or the boat broke down and they had to start fresh there. I'm waiting for another civilization to show up",1
79,Everything implies they died sadly.,0
80,Wait so everyone in the village is descended from two people? Oh my god that's so little genetic diversity how tf did they survive 2000 years?,2
81,"No, those 2 that left even said “take care of the kids” implying they had their own children there they didn’t take with them. The pneumonia pair definitely had kids, it’s obvious because Kinro and Ginro look a LOT like the guy. All six left offspring behind.",2
82,"Well that's good, six still isn't enough genetic diversity though especially if all the males didn't sleep with all the females.",1
83,"Oh yeah I know that, but it’s definitely better than two at least lol",1
84,True that,1
85,"Oh it's not enough no matter what they do.  An analysis  puts the median population needed for sustainability in vertebrates to be 4169 individuals. While careful management might be able to improve it to some extent, they're probably screwed without at least a four digit initial population size.",0
86,Oh wow I thought it was closer to 100 that's pretty crazy,1
87,"There are some analyses for space exploration that puts a number at about 100-150, though that comes with the requirement that the ship returns to the larger Earth population within  20 generations as it's not really sustainable indefinitely. Of course, the village should be long past 20 generations by now, but it actually could have worked out with an initial population of about 100 if the petrified population got revived a lot earlier.",2
88,"The very paper you are citing says in the abstract ""We conclude that a species’ or population’s  minimum viable population  is context-specific, and there are no simple short-cuts to its derivation."" The context here is actually very favorable for the humans.    Humans on an island with complex knowledge being handed down to them have some significant advantages over other species in terms of survivability. Being an apex predator with tools and knowledge handed down to them and a steady means of gathering food  they had a farm, hunting, gathering, and fishing could have augmented this  definitely boosts their chances. The biggest threat that such small populations face is the threat of a single problem wiping them out. But they are blessed to be on an island, severely limiting the number of such extinction-scale events occurring.    Remember that most animals don't manage their interbreeding in small populations. There's a reason why critically endangered species that are well below the ""minimum viable population"" numbers have been brought back to safer population sizes with human intervention. I think it's safe to say that if any species has a solid chance of being their own intervention, it would be humans.",1
89,"As mentioned the 4196 is the  median  number, not the  lower  one, and thank you for restating the thing I said about humans probably needing less than that due to their ability to do careful management except with more words. However, while the number mentioned obviously isn't the actual number for humans, the median value  does  give us a rough idea of where our estimate might be, which makes it reasonable to assume that we'd need a four digit population size.",2
90,"The  wikipedia page on the topic  makes this pretty cut and dry. First of all, ""there is no unique definition of what is a sufficient population for the continuation of a species, because whether a species survives will depend to some extent on random events."" So from the get-go, we should be taking the application of MVP with a grain of salt. No matter the result of our analysis, the animal kingdom is full of surprises. MVP is not an absolute law. This alone makes the situation  plausible  enough to warrant us to overlook any scientific discrepancies for the sake of the story, but while we're on the topic, let's go further, shall we?    While 4196 is the median number when considering inbreeding effects, analyses ignoring the effects of both inbreeding  and  genetic variability typically number between 500-1000. This is the number we should be looking at because humans have cultural taboos and family tracking systems which are incredibly effective at preventing inbreeding. As I've stated elsewhere, because there are 3 starting pairings, at any given time 2 3+ of the population should be a viable partner for a given individual  ignoring gender, of course , which should be plenty to avoid the more immediate concerns of inbreeding indefinitely.     As for genetic variation, that actually works in our favor; humans have unparalleled genetic variation across the entirety of our species. A handful of them would still have some pretty strong variation, so that 500-1000 number is likely to be  overestimating  human population requirements.    Now, in the same section where they discuss these numbers, the wikipedia page also states that ""There is a marked trend for insularity, surviving genetic bottlenecks and r-strategy to allow far lower MVPs than average."" Living on an island, our humans totally check off the requirement for insularity. Consider also the fact that we have recovered species from such numbers before, suddenly the notion that these humans plausibly survived long enough to survive the genetic bottleneck becomes totally realistic. That's two of our factors which allow for ""far lower MVPs than average"". All good news for our humans.    So do we  need  a four-digit population size? No. Not at all. It would be nice, but humans don't really need that many to survive. To survive indefinitely, on the order of 100 or so  a number floated by someone else in the thread for space exploration  seems to be reasonable, and surviving for several thousand years on an island with 6 people seems plenty plausible to suffice for fiction. Especially when you consider how humans have a knack for getting nature's dice to roll in their favor, I don't get why everyone is making such a big fuss out of this.",1
91,"I already took the wikipedia page into account, thanks. It's why I used one of the sources for that page. I've basically taken everything you just said into account but didn't spend 5 paragraphs saying it. Efficient writing is nice.",1
92,          These are mutually exclusive.,1
93,"The author knows that and was asked about it. His response was ""don't think about it too much.""",1
94,But what about the reality where Hitler cured cancer though?,2
95,They are descendants of 4 people,2
96,"No, there were 3 initial pairings of 6 people and each had multiple children.",2
97,dont you mean 6?,2
98,No,0
99,who didnt have kids?,2
100,It seems to be implied Lillian and Byakuya never did. At the end there were only the 4 children running around. Two from the doctors and two from the other couple,2
101,"It seems to be implied that they DID have kids, because when asked if everyone was related to Senku, he said that he wasn't blood-related. If he didn't have kids, it wouldn't have mattered whether he and Senku were related.     If, however, he and Lillian didn't have kids, then he would have had to have children with the daughters left behind by the other two couples.     However, Koharu and her sister sure do look a lot like Lillian.",2
102,"Oh I agree that all the other signs point to them having had children. But the ancestors could just be wrong. 3700 years of oral tradition does not lead to accuracy of historic events. I wouldn't really trust Kohaku to know that she was a direct descendant of anyone, despite looking exactly like Lillian.    And in the flashback there are consistently only the same 4 children shown and at very young ages. Two from the doctors and 2 from the other couple. There could have very well been more we didn't see, but then why did they only show the same 4 children over and over? And never any from Byakuya and Lillian, just the other four?    I think its clear that they intended them all to have children, its just very strange to only show the 4 kids if that was the case.",1
103,"I'd just like to inform you that, for whatever reason despite the similar-ish hair design choice, Senku's ""dad"" is clearly his father by law  by some means like adoption or widowed marriage adoption guardianship , not his father by biology   which is why  THEY BOTH  mention they're not blood-related  .    I'm not aware if it's canon, but Shamil & Connie  pneumonia couple  likely had no children here in the anime.    It doesn't help that the hair & eye colors of a couple children change as  seen here .",2
104,"well at the end of the anime episode you see four kids running around, and two of them have dark hair. So I am assuming those were shamil and connie's kids.",2
105,"Doesn't really make it any better tbh LOL. This is the part that makes it not logical. Child birth death is very likely, plus diseases and infections. There's just extremely low chance, maybe even zero chance that they can actually repopulate to what it is now.",1
106,"It's an anime about the world getting petrified. I wouldn't really stress too much about the nitty gritty, just enjoy the show lol.",1
107,"I know, but for a show that relies on accurate science itself, certain things just make it pretty jarring in comparison. TBH it could work with more than 20 people being on other space station or something. No idea why the author made it so few.",0
108,I mean they could tbh. I guarantee you all the couples tried for a lot more kids than 2 each.,2
109,"The current village is like 40 people. That's extremely doable over 3,700 years.",2
110,The amount of people isn't the problem. Genetics are. Did you even read the thread?,0
111,no the people in the village are descended from the people on the island.  the scientists who left already had children before that,2
112,Four people or even six people is still way way too few for a long term population.,2
113,"Why? What's the problem? Genetically, inbreeding resets after one non-inbred pairing, and with 3 root pairings there's still 2 3+ of the population that any given individual can breed with.    This logic that so few people would survive together basically is a huge slap in the face to the nomadic tribal origins of humanity.",0
114,Yeah it works for a bit but it's not sustainable long term because as far as I know they're the only humans on earth even in tribal settings they still partnered outside the tribe either importing from another tribe or moving to another. To have a long term sustainable population as a mammal you need a lot of biodiversity.,2
115,"Yes and no, I'm talking when tribes of humans were moving across Asia at a blistering pace. The humans who kept moving, never looking back, they likely didn't have many neighbors to interbreed with because they were always moving away from any would-be neighbors.    I've done a more detailed analysis elsewhere in this thread, but here's the short of it:       humans use cultural taboos against incest & complex notions of family to prevent inbreeding, which is typically a much bigger problem for other species     the humans are on an island      human intervention has been shown to completely disintegrate minimum viable population  MVP  numbers     MVP calculations ultimately give a number for  guaranteed  survival and are used to estimate something that is ultimately up to chance.     Once a species makes it past the genetic bottleneck, its chances significantly improve     Humanty's incredible genetic diversity gives even a group of 6 a pretty solid leg-up on the competition    When you consider all of these things together, the notion that humans would survive  not thrive, but survive  in a village starting from 6 founders almost 4000 years later becomes  plausible  enough that we shouldn't be making a big deal out of this.",1
116,Four. The two that died had kids before they did.,2
117,"Except not really, the remaining group doesn't even erect gravestones for them which means they believe they did survived out there.",2
118,"If they did make it, two people is still an insurmountable genetic bottleneck. Even if we play a little loose with minimum viable populations  which has already happened to some degree with their 6 person Adam Eve squad  there's really no way that they could create another lasting group unless they found other survivors.    They could also have created some sort of horrifying incest subspecies that will eventually attack Senku, but that feels a little bit too much for this show lol.",1
119,They could've made it to a city and raided the sperm bank. That'd give them all the genetic diversity they'd ever need.,2
120,"     I don't think that would work though. For the sperm bank to work, the storage needs to be frozen. They left the island after staying there for 3 years. There's no way any stored sperm would still be frozen and viable to use.",0
121,What if all the human sperm turned to stone too?,2
122,Asking the real questions here,2
123,"That's an excellent idea, especially since they were both doctors it's feasible that they could get some sort of IVF up and running and possibly even passing that knowledge along. The main issue of course is that they're limited to a single person carrying all of the children, risking complications from childbirth each time.",1
124,"They're both doctors and this 'raid the sperm bank'  scenario presupposes access to medical equipment. So the risks from childbirth would be quite low. Not as low as in a modern country, but good enough that both the mother and the child would have fantastic odds of making it through just fine.",2
125,"Not necessarily, as years had passed from since when the petrification happened. So 1 slot of spunk has gone bad, the facilities tools are probably not in good nor sanitary conditions due to lack of maintenance think mold, rust , and a large amount of medicine has gone bad or has lost potency. Meaning they have to due this without electricity, in facilities that are not in the cleanest state, with tools that may have been rendered ineffective, with medicine that either doesn't work or that they'll struggle with giving effective and yet safe dosages, and likely severe lack of facilities to allow them to sanitize anything.",2
126,Also lets not forget the simple thing that if they survived and had access to all that they surely would have access to a boat from a harbour for the journey back.,2
127," By the time they went to the mainland three years had passed, so there'll be nothing usable in those banks anymore.",2
128,Sure hope that place had a great backup generator with several years of gas!,2
129,"Even with supplied genetic diversity from a sperm bank it would still all have to go through a bottleneck due to the low amount of women providing the second half of the genetic material. At best it pushes the problem back a generation or two out of hundreds. Humans are also very slow at reproducing, so even assuming the few women were okay with constantly going through the whole pregnancy child birth cycle it wouldn't get you a large enough population in the end to avoid the genetic bottleneck.",2
130,"Then why have other species come back from such bottlenecks before with human intervention?    Human genetic diversity is incredible, so the genetic diversity among the 6 starting humans is already probably pretty high. Granted that the genetic diversity of such a bottlenecked group isn't going to be great, but mind you that cheetahs survive with unbelievably low genetic variation. Fundamentally, the genetic diversity of a group isn't the end-all-be-all for the viability of a species.",2
131," Cheetahs still recovered from around 6-7 members, not 2. And like you said, modern cheetahs are riddled with disease and poor sperm quality, due to being so genetically similar that any cheetah can successfully receive a transplanted organ from any other cheetah with no chance of rejection. Not to mention that Cheetahs surviving this long is more than likely a statistical fluke, as even without our intervention it's fairly likely they'll go extinct due to some random disease anytime now.     While you're right that in the short term  read: short term evolutionary wise  lack of genetic diversity isn't much of an issue, in the mid to long term it's a death sentence as lack of genetic diversity means an inability to adapt to changing conditions, which leads to extinction.",2
132,"     That's literally where these humans are starting. 6 humans, with 3 pairings among them. So... there's no problem here?",2
133, In this case the guy I'm talking to said the russian couple may have lived after disappearing and started another group with just the two of them.,2
134,"Ah well that's not just improbable, that's impossible. Inbreeding is guaranteed at that point, they wouldn't last more than a few generations tops lol",1
135,the thing with humans we are much less susceptible to low genetic diversity screwing us over then other animals the issue with low genetic diversity is changes in the environment can fuck animals over. unless one parent is predisposed to genetic disorders a population of 2 starting humans is perfectly viable.    in this day an age assuming no genetic disorders are present we could all be pretty much identical genetically and humans would still survive because humans dont rely on genetics to survive changing environments. we change the environment to suit out needs or we make things to help us survive. we find a way to fix issues the environment lays out for us.     ;    suddenly colder we make warmer clothing and wear warmer clothing we don't rely on being geneically suited to cold weather     ;    suddenly warmer our bodies are well build to handle heat we just need to drink more water to supply our built in cooling mechanisms     ;    we also can make things to help us get food from most sources we are not genetically built to catch fish we use rope bait and hooks to do that     ;    most issues with genetic diversity wont aply to humans as long as the humans are not pre disposed to genetic disorders. humans are pretty damn safe thanks to our brains making us super adaptable.,2
136," You're forgetting disease. A genetically identical similar population means genetically identical similar immune systems, something viruses and bacteria can easily take advantage of and fuck us over with.      Take bananas, if you didn't know, before the 50's the most popular banana type got obliterated when a fungus took advantage of that type's genetic identitcality, forcing the world to switch over to the banana type we use now, which is also genetically identical and constantly at risk of that same fungus adapting and wiping it all out as well.     Now, remember the issue that after like 1 or 2 generations russian adam and eve's kids would lose all access to any modern medical knowledge. So as soon as pneumonia or something pops up, they're all dead. And that issue only gets worse as time goes by and the viruses and bacteria continue to adapt while their shitty inbred immune systems don't.",0
137,Except this is an isolated population where other humans arent around to introduce new disease.  Hence any disease that does pop up has to be new and compete with our immune systems adapting to it immunity to disease takes far less time to adapt to then environmental changes.    Immune systems rely much less on genentics and more on previous exposure. Genetic immunity isnt really a thing its just immune systems are more flexible when your younger and being exposed while in ur young teens gives you the best chance to fight of the disease and become immune to it so again that base is covered. As long as a female is able to fight it off once and is lactating she can affectively save the others.    The mothers breastmilk passes on some antibodies which is why some populations are immune to certain diseases. Its not genetic immmunity its a case of mother has survived the disease and has a child the child gets sick but the mother gives the child the antibodies needed to fight it off child survives and is now immune.,2
138,"  The immune system's ability to recognize foreign antigens on bacteria and viruses, and thus alert T and B cells to beat them up, rely on the MHC genes in our DNA. Variety in MHC genes is vital as a single MHC gene can only identify a few markers, and thus a large variety of MHC Genes across a diverse population is necessary for a species as a whole to combat the ever evolving threat of viruses.      It is these differences in our MHC genes that allow some people to survive diseases they've never been exposed to before while others just die, and why heavily inbred populations like cheetahs, florida panthers, and certain varieties of lab mice are at constant risk of going extinct to a singular virus or bacteria and why they have weak immune systems in general.     Source: I'm a biology major with a concentration on genetics",2
139,Yes i know my cousin is a geneticist. You have to also consider the starting gene pool is actually massive in this case. Even if senku was related to kohaku the senku would still be more genetically close to gen then he would to kohaku infact that village has more genetic diversity then native Japanese and pretty much any other native population pre globalisation. Also chances of a plague wiping them out is very low given that they would know how to prevent the spread. You can see pneumonia is highly infectious and only one person in the village has it. Where this should be prime pickings for pneumonia to spread. But thanks to cleanliness of the villafe their risk to a plague is very low. Reduced further by the lack of other humans to introduce new disease.,2
140," Whoa, hol-up, I've been talking about the 2 person Russian group that another guy earlier in the thread said might've survived and started a different group, to which I've been arguing that two people is too little with even 6 being a stretch.      It appears we've been misunderstanding each other.",1
141,... kms lmao yeah two would be difficult since they cant have a lot of children in the case something does go wrong. From 2 people they would need to have 12 kids in order to safefuard against potential fk ups thats a stretch,1
142,"The authors said in an interview that the whole inbreeding genetic diversity detail is basically something you have to handwave away for the sake of the plot. In other words, they know this would be a problem in real life but it's never going to come into play in the series.",2
143,Four people. The two that died had kids before they did.,2
144,Yep and the last was Senku's dad looking after the kids,2
145,"Speaking of mainland, those kids lived on the isolated island for some time. Maybe for several generations. When they finally moved to Japan, all the knowledge and products of civilization could've been already lost. That can explain why that village is still in stone age.",2
146,"Well, that, and specialized knowledge requires specialized people. In a population that small, people can't afford to specialize. And a lot of their discipline requires tools which are built and maintained by  other  specialists. And even the most specialized don't keep all their knowledge in their heads, and maintenance of text also requires specialists.    By the fifth generation, the only things they'll have managed to retain are those things they've managed to put into story form  and thus are kept by the village storyteller, the one specialist they can afford  or stone tablet form. Paper rots, and the knowledge of humankind requires a LOT more than the few brains they have there to maintain.",2
147,"I'm a bit late to the party, but this doesn't make sense to me at all.    I might be crazy, but I'm pretty sure that you have to be at least slightly above average intelligence to qualify as an astronaut?    I get that Senku is a ludicrous genius that apparently knows everything about everything and that isn't realistic, but are we really fine with 6 astronauts not being able to accomplish anything more than wooden huts???    This just blows my mind. Like I would even be fine with them not having electricity, although a strong argument can be made that 3k years is more than enough time, but at least have them reach the medieval times or something. This just makes everything way less believable and smells like a convenient plot hole to have Senku fill with his endless intelligence.      EDIT: Also, how is the population still so small?",2
148,"the population is small because they don't have agriculture or medicine, they are at the stage of hunter gatherers but they seem to stay in the same spot, they can't maintain much of a population.    in order to make houses out of stone and brick, you need tonnes and tonnes of manual labor. a system like feudalism provides that, but there aren't enough people for a feudalistic society.      the reason nothing really progresses is because of Senku, all of Byakua's focus was on getting his descendants to last long enough until Senku comes back. instead of teaching them how to progress technologically, he taught them how to survive and nothing more.",2
149,"How exactly was he going to teach them anything more? As smart as they are, those scientists are the products of educational systems and career lines that require literally millions of people to support, not to mention a  lot  of extra time for the student. You can't pass on knowledge like that using a mere apprentiship system, and you can't take advantage of a system like that when you're having to put all your efforts into food and shelter. Science is not passed from father to son, and students cannot study without the capital structure to support them until their studies are complete.    A lot of kids think they could start an industrial revolution by themselves if they went back in time with their physics textbook. Sorry kids; it doesn't work that way.",0
150,"You dont need to by a physicist to learn basic crop rotation, metal working, and animal domestication.",2
151,"I understand the argument that you need a lot of people for physical labor.    All I'm saying is that at least basic knowledge should've have been passed down verbally. I mean just knowing that something like a steam engine is possible would probably save thousands of years. Also, these people don't even know about their past and what happened?    Again, just having the basic awareness would, I think, go a very long way.",1
152,"The Romans had a basic awareness; Archimedes, as I understand it, had a functioning one. Didn't help anyone.    That said, it  is  surprising they didn't at least chose a location that would allow the construction of a water wheel. Perhaps predators were actually dangerous enough they felt the need to fortify themselves on that island. And why don't they at least have dogs?    There is weirdness here, but their lack of industrial era technology is not among the weirdness, IMO.",1
153,"Honestly, even if they built up a decent level of civilization, all it would have taken is a good plague to reset things to zero. It's actually happened plenty of times in the past. There are entire civilizations in the Near East that had to learn how to read and write from scratch because plagues and or wars wiped out the people who knew how to read write  a tiny sliver of the population in a bronze age society  which pretty much reset those societies back to the neolithic age.",0
154,I am quite sure they made a better plan than stories. The stories was the civilization falls backup.,1
155,one main reason is cause no one was an engineer,2

158,Byakuya was awesome. Senku certainly inherited his father's balls-     Wait what?  Where the fuck does Senku get his hair from?!        eh ,1
159,They used the same shampoo,2
160,"My theory is that he was planned to be his fatehr from the beginning. Their designs are way too similar for them to be unrelated. However, they retconned him to non-biological dad for the people that don't understand how ancestry genetics work and might complain if Senkuu gets together with Kohaku.        cantbehelped ",0
161,Ten billion percent sounds like a retcon to me,2
162,Even their face and eye color is the same.,2
163,"Minor Reboot manga spoiler: Byakuya is actually his biological father, but lied to be a good wingman.",2
164,lol really? I was reading the reboot and hadn't seen that.,1
165,"No, but it's my headcanon anyway.",2
166,Could be uncle,2
167,Except Senku said this episode that they arent related at all,2
168,"In the twist of the century, the two scientists happen to be completely unaware that uncles and nephews are actually related and just thought it was some sort of honorary title.",2
169,Senku and Byakuya both.,2
170,Didn't he say they aren't blood related and only related legally. That implies adoption but I'm guessing uncle by marriage works too,2
171,Maybe he's a clone? The last opening had him in a observation room as a kid.,2
172,My headcanon.,2
173,Does that soft confirm that senku will end up with kohaku or someone else? Anime is really weird like that with always hinting that the MCs like each other and only confirming it at the last possible second. Like I guess the show wants to encourage waifu shipping without actually committing to it. Still odd though because that means someone actually thought about it and tried to work around it.,2
174,I think it has to. I can’t think of another good reason for that to be the case,2
175,Right? Isn't it weird? I feel like this means that the dr stone series is going to end with senku having a family sometime in the future like with fmab. The romance is blatant but because it's anime you don't commit to it until the series ends as an epilogue scene.,1
176,"10 billion per cent this. However! It might actually have been a the better choice thematically, because a  what those before us leave for all of mankind is a central theme, and it works in this sense that Senku's dad can love him so much despite having no genetic connection b  Senku's dad was a ""normal smart person"" as opposed to a ridiculous genius like Senku, but it was seeing Senku's potential that made him decide to work his ass off until he became an astronaut. Arguably, that he would realize he had adopted one of humanity's brightest minds makes it all the more powerful the effort he'd go through to ""rise above"" his usual self to be the kind of person who could nourish such potential.",1
177,The obvious and logical answer is that Senkuu eventually makes a time machine and goes back to adopt his younger self.   I am 10 billion percent certain of this.   s,1
178,"And even after  that  Senku bothered to say ""it was hundreds of generations ago"", so your theory is most likely right.",1
179,"Which is funny since Chrome and Kohaku's sister, that is one of the most obvious ships on the show, are related but the staff didn't cared lol",1
180,"Yeah iirc in the manga theres a notable gap between him saying Byakuya is his father and the mentioning they're not blood relatives. It absolutely reeked of editor interference, and I was hoping the anime would change it.",0
181,That's exactly what I was thinking. They totally were written as blood relatives until this part in the story where they wanted to avoid any questions about future incest - regardless of how distant they are related.,1
182,Same with Naruto - Jiraya,2
183,How exactly is that remotely the same?,2
184,editor was right,1
185,My theory as well. Never it put it past executive fuddy duddies to overreact.,0
186,Oh. I thought Senku was just a horrible science e experiment in crossbreeding humans a leeks and was afterwards adopted and raised as a scientist.,1
187,"it seems like a pretty big hint that Senku & Kohaku WILL in fact ""get together"".",1
188,I felt like him not being his biological father added a lot to the emotional impact.,1
189,I really hoped the anime would go the other way but sadly...,0
190,"They had a whole incest village, they have then separated by hundreds of generations, marriage between cousins is legal in Japan.    And yet they had to pull the ""not actually blood related"" card for the incest route.",1

198,     You would in anime.        chitogheh ,2
199,       He gets his hair from his biological dad....  Sun-Ken-Rock ,2
200,Maybe he like adopted Senku  because  of the hair being the same?,2

216,"I don't think ""inbred"" is a magical ritual that automatically kills everybody. Luck could certainly be involved, as well as genetic hygiene practices that could have been baked into their culture  via priestess stories  determining who was allowed to marry who  and possibly even requiring swapping from time to time . Given these were scientists, and that it isn't actually that complicated to figure out, it isn't at all unreasonable to infer that this is present in their culture off-screen, just not brought up in-show because it's shonen.    This is actually a real world thing, IIRC. I read an article years ago about the Samaritan community, numbering in the hundreds, that do not marry out of the community for reasons of religion, and have elaborate requirements determining who can marry who in order to avoid the expression of recessive genetic diseases.",2
217,Add killing defective infants like the it seams the entire ancient world did and you can get away with the massive thousands of years of brother sister and even father daughter marriage in Ancient Egypt.

Brother Sister pair had the greatest number of live adult children in the records.,2

236,I assume that stories were plan B. Plan A was everyone votes Town Hall followed by Representative Democracy. Save a library worth of books. A regular education system. And a push from the start for a civilization reboot. No reason to wait for a son whom you have no actual knowledge will be able to come back to life.   But Father must have had some political and cultural history background and knew a Dark Age could occur from a coup that destroyed the democratic government they had established for their children.   So the stories would be a back up in case A. The adults died before the kids got old enough to fully learn plan A. Or the stories more likely to survive if treated as a religious expression and not be extremely clear being more story like. And we know they taught all the kids the stories but the stories had actually be confined to the religious woman only by the time of DR Stone which was probably a result of a major culture shift.,2
237,he was writing it down and talked about writing in english being hard. idk where you got the oral tradition bit from. no way oral traditions wouldn't change over the 3000 year timespan.,2
238,"I disagree, finding out that that village had been around for 3700 years completely broke my suspension of disbelief",1

240,There's no particular reason to believe the Sentinelese are descended from a breeding population as small as six. The inbreeding is only one of several problems here anyway.,2
241,Interbreeding from people of different nationalities gives a lot of genetic variation.  They still wouldn’t die off though just from interbreeding.  The people with deformities will die off sooner than those that don’t have them. Your population would be less likely to form deformities over time due to that fact. At least any of the life endangering ones.  Of course their immune response would still bad much like most of the world if not exposed to certain diseases.     Also the Sentinelese lasted much longer with interbreeding and I doubt they were genetically varied internationally when they started the tribe.,2
242,also     its just humans arent as vulnerable to low genetic variation as other animals assuming their are no predisposed genetic disorders they will be fine the biggest issue with low genetic diversity is that they have no way to respond to environmental changes.    but humans can make and create things as a response to environmental changes as such we are much less vulnerable with low genetic diversity tldr brains are fucking awesome and make us super adaptable to the point low genetic diversity wont destroy us,2
243,"Being from a bunch of different nationalities does not matter in the slightest. Six people just isn't enough, and there's more genetic variation within groups than between groups anyway.",2
244,Even so they still wouldn’t just die from deformities. How would any species ever be able propagate anyway if this was the case?,2
245,Species reduced to breeding populations that small basically always go extinct. Species are able to survive when their population stays large enough to maintain genetic diversity and never goes through a bottleneck like that.,2
246, no its just humans arent as vulnerable to low genetic variation as other animals assuming their are no predisposed genetic disorders they will be fine the biggest issue with low genetic diversity is that they have no way to respond to environmental changes.    but humans can make and create things as a response to environmental changes as such we are much less vulnerable with low genetic diversity tldr brains are fucking awesome and make us super adaptable to the point low genetic diversity wont destroy us.     ;    we arent as prone to natural selection as other animals which is the reason why animals with low genetic diversity die out the moment something in the envinment changes nothing in the population is built to survive it but humans just go fuck you were jsut gonna make clothes  shelter or make tools and other things to survive,2

249,It is pretty unbelievable that the stories have remained 100% unchanged  as it's implied  without them being written down anywhere,1
250,Story telling actually has survived for extremely long periods of time with few if any changes from research of groups with a storytelling tradition. In story telling cultures the people learning them are trained to recite the story exactly as taught.     And don't say what you said around say a Native of Australia they are quite convinced they got their stories handed down pure.     What we are familiar with is in cultures who actually have writing to do full recall part the telling of stories falls to entertainers as storytellers no longer needed and then it is well known that the stories are constantly changing in this situation.,2

252,"You're watching a show where magically people are petrified without dying, get broken out by bat shit and this is what bothers you?    It's a   fantasy   science show. Relax.",1

254,"Without saying too much, this village existing is a huge part of the premise.",2
255,"If you can't say too much without spoiling things, then by definition it's not part of the premise.",2
256,I think you misunderstand; the rules around spoilers are so rigid on this sub  and rightfully so  that it's better to err on the side of caution and say nothing than risk a ban for something that could be construed as rule breaking.,1
257,If something is part of the premise there is no risk it would  ever  be seen as a spoiler.,2
258,myth inbreeding dosent cause genetic diseases. it just increases the likelihood that a child born will have a genetic disease if the parents are pre disposed of it.     then you might bring up the low genetic diversity issue but no its just humans arent as vulnerable to low genetic variation as other animals assuming their are no predisposed genetic disorders they will be fine the biggest issue with low genetic diversity is that they have no way to respond to environmental changes.    but humans can make and create things as a response to environmental changes as such we are much less vulnerable with low genetic diversity tldr brains are fucking awesome and make us super adaptable to the point low genetic diversity wont destroy us.    we arent as prone to natural selection as other animals which is the reason why animals with low genetic diversity die out the moment something in the envinment changes nothing in the population is built to survive it but humans just go fuck you were jsut gonna make clothes  shelter or make tools and other things to survive,2

291,"I mean no. The doctor couple  I forget their names  Clearly had children, and so did Lilian and Byakuya. So there is almost 100% some non-incest babies.",1
292,That's 6 unrelated people. That gene pool is tiny and they would have to resort to incest after 2 or 3 generations already.,2
293,"Humans are intelligent and can do targeted reproduction to reduce the incest risks of such a small genepool. For example, we managed to get  Black Footed ferrets  back up to a stable population from an 18 individuals bottleneck. It isn't ideal since genetic diversity is still very low, but they aren't suffering from incest defects or anything.    Doing that from 6 individuals is a bit more of a puzzle, but I can see a stable population forming with a little bit of creative polygamy for the first few generations.",2
294,Well seeing as the one woman and man had only one child you're working with much less than ideal conditions for the 6 and I'm also assuming the other two guys didn't have babies with the other two women so that makes it even harder    Edit: looking at the article they got 35 ferrets from 18 via artificial insemination and they then released them into the wider population. While that's fairly impressive I don't think it's nearly on the same level of difficulty as the astronauts are facing,2
295,"     That doesn't mean much. Incest defects are directly caused by a lack of genetic diversity, so either you have both or neither.    The minimum  viable population size  is hard to quantify and I've heard estimates going from 60 to 700+. But 6 is far below the minimum.",2

302,That is the most limited version of Incest. Many US states and other countries still consider first cousins Incest. And there are way broader Incest definitions and some were and maybe are still enforced in some places.,2
303,"All three couples had kids, as Shamil says that he'd never thought he'd have kids, heavily implying he did end up with them. Besides, Connie would have had to have kids for there to be so many black haired people in the village. Blonde might be recessive, but 4 6 people are blonde and we don't know if Byakuya was ever black-haired.    They'd still be inbred by the third fourth generation though, everyone is descended from just 6 people.",2
304,No way they could survive 2000 years with 6 only peoples descendants pretty sure you need at least 80 people to not be horribly horribly inbred over the course of those 2000 years,0
305,It's a lot lower than that I know from horse and dog breeders creations of new breeds. Thus a lot of puppies drowned. But it would require lots of infanticide.

Isolated islands and the few remaining 'uncontacted' tribes in particular, but anywhere before modern transit would have plenty of interbred families across hundreds of years. The most extreme I know if would be the descendants of the HMS Bounty who are still alive today. I've yet to hear of a the population that couldn't keep reproducing for being too inbred.     Not that there wouldn't be issues but Ishigami village should have a pretty medieval infant mortality rate  anyways  and you've had thousands of years for random mutation and breeding the survivors too.",2

The Famous Cleopatra VII, extremely smart and captivating, has several brother sister marriages and a Grandfather to Granddaughter marriage in her line and her mother probably was her brothers sister after all that was the law and why Cleopatra married both of her brothers before they got disposed of later.

368,I think the two had kids before dying?,2
369,"They're somewhat helped by how the space station team was an international one so the initial genetic diversity was probably as good as it could get, but yeah that's way too small of a genetic bottleneck.",2
370,Inbred people's brains don't exactly work very well,2
371,no its just humans arent as vulnerable to low genetic variation as other animals assuming their are no predisposed genetic disorders they will be fine the biggest issue with low genetic diversity is that they have no way to respond to environmental changes.    but humans can make and create things as a response to environmental changes as such we are much less vulnerable with low genetic diversity tldr brains are fucking awesome and make us super adaptable to the point low genetic diversity wont destroy us,2
372,"To a certain point.   My field of study is neurobiology  techinically it's neurophysiology but nvm , I have studied genetics as well, and from I reckon the issue just that, it's the presence of possible negative mutations.     There are lots of genes that all of us have with 1 recessive trait that could be damaging, but since the possibility of finding someone carrying such a trait  which is reduced even more by a process such as the x-cross between chromosomes  is really lol.   But if you keep breeding the same people, with the same origins, sooner or later those stastically present traits will appear, which may lead to early deaths, illnesses ect ect.",2
373,Yes but these are still a statistical minority and not really going to destroy a population and given how strict the astronaut selection process on health is its safe to assume these people are very low risk of being disease carriers all in all the situation is very viable. Gene pool is still surprisingly diverse since international space station. Astronauts have to be extremely healthy  even colourblindness will render u unfit  so this is definitely a very viable starting population especially given its humans,2
374,"It's a matter of illness, it's a matter of hidden genetic mutations.   You can't test for things you can't even know if they are present or not because, surprise surprise, that would require a testcross, which is performed through specific reproduction with another organismi having for sure the needed genes.     And you just can't do this on humans.   An astronaut may be pinnacle of physical training and health, but it's impossible to consider every single possible mutation in a subject.  Genetics is a bitch and WILL kick you in the ass without an adequate genepool. That's just how things go. With a 2 children for every possible couple It would be somewhat more realistic for them to survive.",2
375,You have to consider from 2 people alone you get over 200000+ different possible combination of genes with inbreeding the chances of a bad mutation showing up is increased 10 fold but thats still 1 10000 to 1 1000 and chances are much higher that the negative trait wont show up  at all most humans have a passive trait thankz to modern medicine saving people who woulf otherwise die and not pass on their bad trait. Its much likelier that maybe over 20 or so generations that everyone with a bad trait dies off then have the bad traits destroy the population. Source is my cousin who is a geneticist. The sole fact that we are almost immune to environmental changes makes it very possible for us to survive having ridiculously low gene pools. We could all be clones and we could still survive.,2
376,Also astronauts are genetocally screened.,2
377,This 100%     They for sure should have gotten kids with everyone and not just the person they fall in love with,1
378,some things are better left off-screen,1
379,"Yeah after 3700 years Senku would have less in common genetically with the descendants than any random person has with their spouse. But still the editor probably mandated in fear of dumbwits being all like ""lol incest lol"".    For what it's worth it works thematically, since ""what those before have left for humanity as a whole"", such as Senku talking about the gifts of old man Edison, is a central theme.",2
380,"That's probably not totally true since their genetic pool is just six individuals, and then it looks like they had like... four kids in the second generation? So if Byakuya had been Senku's real dad, he'd have shared something on the order of 1 6th of his DNA with his ancestors, which is around great-grandparent grandparent levels... But his ancestors would certainly share more than that with each other, so Senku is less incesty than their other options.     Novel mutations are pretty slow to proliferate, so even after 3700 years it would be interesting to see how much diversity would have changed. After leaving Africa, humans have mostly lost DNA they used to have, and we've had way more time and genetic diversity to work with since then.    The more likely outcome, if you're looking for realistic science is they'd become so inbred they'd be extinct within ten generations.",2

422,Yes it really sounds like a forced thing otherwise the father design probably would be different.,2

In the past it was socially acceptable for noble families that needed an heir to adopt one, or if a daughter was marrying a less distinguished family her husband might take her name and become a 'son' of his wife's family. And so help me its generally not a  major  plot point. Though how much of that is simply being very Japanese and expecting you to recognize but not ask about difficult situations I have not the foggiest.     Of course on the other end... story ain't over either so maybe it will come up. Like we've heard exactly squat about Senku's mother and she  in theory  should be a statue that can be revived, that could trigger a whole lot. Though I won't expect that.",2

440," After  he becomes a war hero.    Actually, wouldn't a war hero village leader who opens the world for conquest qualify as a king? And don't kings get harems?",1
441,Yes when they have a king. Pre STD's lots of primitive tribes had triple orgies and women had sex once or more times a day with four or more partners source Ted TV backed up by my readings over 40 years. This is why European Explorers all over the world would show up at new tribe and the the whole expedition had sex if they wanted to. I love Captain Cooks ships being greeted by flotilla of boats full of women with flowers who wanted to have sex with the new men. Normal past Human female behavior is 180 degrees from that we are familiar with. Humans are the most sexual animal our females the only ones who are always in heat. And study the sexual behavior of Bonobos who are our closest relatives along with chips and thing we are more sexual than Bonobos it will blow your mind.    STD's though totally warped human behavior in civilization as population got high enough due to agriculture and agriculture required a division of females being that a tribe gathering not practical anymore all of the more conservative morality had to start up in crude ways to limit STD transmission. STD's normally don't form in species with numbers as low as humans before civilization. If a STD forms in a low population species that local part normally dies off not transmitting to other populations of that species.,2
442,Gorilla Girl is already a product of almost 3700 years of non-stop incest though.,2

445,Or a GWAR album.,2
446,That explains why the distance between her mouth and eyes are so off.,2
447,"I mean it could be a cop out, but we never heard of Senku’s mom or see her. She would of had to die when Senku was born. Also the timeline says that Senku’s father failed the astronaut test the year Senku was born, so unless he was planning to go to space with a baby on the way, maybe after he failed he focused more on his previous life choices as a teacher and figured he’d like a son cause he liked teaching kids or something. Genetically speaking Senku and his dad don’t look very similar hair wise. We know Senku’s hair is naturally a green onion sticking up sky high, but Byakuya’s is black and white and straight down at the age of 40ish. I could definitely see them not being related and Byakuya choosing to focus on his life on earth by getting a son cause his dream failed.",2

449,It was brought up in earlier thread that dna has a way to dodge incest over many generations.,2
450,Not so much dodge but infincide and not alowing defective older people to have children goes a long way to reduce incest problems and increase the advantages of incest.  Just learned German Shepard product in part of more than one generation of Father Daughter Incest. Need more details of how many dog lines actually were used. Before that have for a long time known Dog and Horse Breeders have used incest to create new breeds by drowning reject babies.,2
451,Literally the one time where that’s probably not necessary in an anime and they really make sure to drive that point home.,1

470,"He isn't just Senku's dad; he's his mentor. Senku's a fantasy character, of course, but the trope has a real-world analogue that either gets found and trained up, or neglected and ends up in an even worse position than normal people. Senku got found by someone who could actually help him reach his potential.",1
471,"Senku's dad is my favorite character in all of Dr Stone precisely because of the way he contextualizes Senku: his absolute faith in human capacity obviously comes from his dad's own absolute faith in his potential.     It's far-fetched but not unimaginable that a  great, kind  man could see the potential in his adopted child to be one of humanity's greatest minds, and wind up making the hard choice of putting everything in to ""rise above"" to be able to meet such a gifted child's needs. I love it because Senku being the savior of humanity isn't randomly being ""the chosen one"", but rather precisely because his dad recognized all he could be and gave everything to nourish that.    Yes he's the chosen one in the sense he was born a genius, but Dr Stone pretty much states that it wouldn't be possible without his father's sacrifices. Which is important in a show about how ultimately humanity's life-changing inventions can only happen with the backup of a stable community society for geniuses to be able to pursue their ideas.    Even his appreciation for ""big oaf"" and what other non-geniuses can bring to the table obviously comes from his dad in full context, since Senku must realize his ""normal-smart-but-non-genius"" sacrifices and such are what made it possible for him to get the education needed for his big brain.",1
472,"I just realized, Senku's basically Science Alexander the Great.",1
473,"Holy shit, you're so right! What a realization.",1
474,This is a really good point that I've never seen brought up in discussions. It's obvious despite Senku's irreverence towards Byakuya that he respects him a lot but I've never thought about it that way.,1
475,I wonder if Tsukasa had the opposite upbringing to senku. The adults in his life weren't much use to him and his sister,1
476,Even after whole world petrified he stills believes in Senku for the humanity! That's some trust!,1
477," Dr. Brand  wasn't wrong, love is the one thing that transcends time and space.",1
478,"Actually I'd say Dr. Stone is far better at making that point, because it doesn't rely on completely wild bullshit like love guiding you to navigate the tesseract in Interstellar. Rather, Byakuya's love for Senku comes across through very grounded actions, whose effects however manage to ripple through millennia and reach him nevertheless.",1
479,That's not what love was about in Interstellar. It wasn't love that ran the tesseract. It was love that motivated Cooper to figure out a way to send the crucial data to the crucial person in the past by knowing his daughter through and through.    Not to mention that Cooper was going ever so slightly crazy at that point and was making an wry callback to when lady scientist was trying to BS her way to her loverboy's planet.,1
480,"It didn't just motivate him though, it actually helped him find her exact window among a bajillion possibilities.     That's the problem I have with that representation. ""Love is a powerful emotion that motivates humans to push themselves to their very limits and achieve incredible things,"" I can get behind. ""Love is literally a metaphysical force that allows you to overcome impossible odds"" is a bit too much, at least for an otherwise relatively hard sci-fi setting like Interstellar. When Harry Potter did it in Philosopher's Stone for example it was literal magic, so whatever.",1
481,"When did they ever state that love is what brought Cooper to the right spot in the tesseract though? The tesseract was a 3d representation of Murph's room throughout time. So he had the location down already. And the temporal window that Cooper had access to was likewise really short, a couple of weeks at most. So you don't exactly need divine intervention to find the right spot at the right time to send your signal.",1
482,"Oftentimes, hard science fiction will end up putting into scientistic terms things which are normally the domain of religion and fantasy. I've never seen Interstellar, but it sounds to me like they decided to make the notion that ""God is Love"" a literal truth of their setting, just one whose meaning was not successfully transmitted by those who had the job of transmitting it. It had to be rediscovered.",1
483,"It's not exactly like that, but close. At some point at the middle of the movie, the astronauts have to make a choice, which is whether to visit Planet A or Planet B  they're looking for a new world for humanity to colonise , when they only have fuel for one. Planet A seems more promising and they have a report from an astronaut sent to scout it saying that it's livable. From Planet B they have no news, but one of the crewmembers says she has a gut feeling they should go there. When the others ask why, she says it's because the planet was being scouted by her boyfriend - and if they don't visit it, he'll be left there to die. They say that's not a rational argument to bet the future of humanity on, and she replies with a speech about how love is perhaps a fundamental force of the universe we still don't understand. They roll their eyes and go to Planet A.    It turns out she was right because the scout on Planet A is lying because he wanted to be rescued, and the place is a wasteland. Later on, the protagonist ends up dumped in a black hole, floating in the fifth dimension, and trying to communicate with his daughter years in the past so he can set the events of the whole movie in motion - long story - but basically it's like looking for a needle in a five-dimensional infinite non-Euclidean haystack. At which point he goes ""oh, maybe she was right!"" and, huh, follows love I guess?, and finds her immediately.    It's kind of dumb. Not the only dumb thing in the movie, by the way, by a long shot.",0

486," They were hanging heads down in Soyuz for 10 hours.  That's kinda uncomfortable. Though, not as bad as trying to stay sane while being alone in the darkness for 3000 years.",0
487,I wonder why they stayed upside down.  Humans don't do so well when hanging upside down.     I'd expect them to unbuckle themselves and sit on the ceiling. They might even be able to flip the capsule by all leaning on 1 side of the spacecraft so they can get some fresh air.,1
488,I am wondering how Byaku managed to get them out      If the capsule isnt straigthening itself they would have still drowned when he tried to pull them out,2
489,"I am wondering how Byaku even found them.      If it really was a 10h one way with a row boat, as we've learned in  Sounan desuka? , finding something so smell is incredibly unlikely.",2
490,"Emergency beacon probably. In real life, the capsule has one. He'd just need a radio to pick it up",2
491,exactly,1
492,The plot armor must be quite smelly yeah           But I think that 10h was with them preparing and landing their soyuz,2
493,"In this case you can say its plot Armour, but there are a lot of unlikely things that happened in history too.",2
494,I learned in history that unlikely shit happens. USA only exists because some idiots forgot ladders.    Then there was that one dude who sniped the ace fighter pilot in the world wars with a rifle.,2
495,Ladders?,2
496,Here is the event.    - ,2
497,"Not to nitpick  so exactly that , but even if the British had the ladders that's no guarantee that they would have succeeded.  As well as a peace treaty was already signed by the time the battle took place. So in reality, if the British did capture New Orleans it wouldn't significantly affect the outcome of the war. This is not to mention that Britain at this point did not seriously consider re-annexing the US nor could they even hope to invade and control the continent.",2
498,it wasnt 10 hours with a row boat it was 10 hours including the landing we can safely assume the pod likely had some sort of tracking device and the island byaku landed on wasnt too far hence perfectly viable     ;    assume landing took about 8-9 hours and that they knew the pods location its perfectly viable for byaku to get to the pod with a row boat given he claimed to be able to swim 10 km fully clothed,2
499,Its 10h away from where they were in space and I def saw at one point it was 10k away which is less of a distance than it seems  6.2 miles ,2
500,"They could probably swim well enough to make it out of the capsule and into the boat, if they had tried to swim to land from the capsule, no way",2
501,I would imagine you just let it take on water and swim out,2
502,"its not that they would instantly drown the second they opened the hatch, but they were in the middle of the ocean, if they left the capsule, it would sink and they would be stuck treading water in the middle of nowhere.",2
503,"I imagine they'd avoid unbuckling themselves to avoid having to much weight pressure on the exit hatch, since that's what they'd be sitting on then.",2
504,"The hatch is made to survive reentry, pretty sure it can handle someone falling on it.",2
505,Coupled with water pressure?,2
506,"The door's like half a meter under water at most, do you seriously believe the water pressure at that level is anywhere near enough to make any impact whatsoever on a freaking reentry capsule?        shirayukifuckinreally ",2
507,"Yeah, couldn't they, like, just sort of roll the capsule upwards, hamster wheel style? Granted, it's much more massive than them, but it's also sitting on water, with very low friction.",2
508,not really the shape of it makes it very difficult,2
509,"I didn't get this either. Like I'm not as smart as an astronaut, but even my dumbass knows if all of them lined up on one side of the cylinder it would roll",2

514,"Makes you really appreciate all the effort Kohaku has done to keep her sister alive, just as Senku said, if it wasn't for her, Ruri would've died long ago",1
515,Is vulnerability  to pneumonia genetic in some way? Cuz if that's the case then that's hell of a tie in.,0
516,"tl;dr: No. It's historically a leading cause of death in the world. The only things that make you ""more vulnerable"" are if you're a child, elderly, pregnant, cold, a smoker, have medical conditions like asthma or HIV, or are around people who have it.    Anyone can get pneumonia  aka, lung infection . There are many different causes, from bacteria to viruses to fungi -- most are spread by coughing. Catching ones of these doesn't instantly mean pneumonia. But it does mean every time you get sick, there's a risk you'll develop it. It can be mild, so that you don't notice. It can be severe. If it's severe, there's a high chance you'll die without medical intervention. Aka, it's a lottery.    Other characters likely got sick too off-screen, but they recovered. Eventually, they lost the lottery too.    The influenza virus  the flu  is the more well known cause -- seasonal flu shots with updated virus strands happen in the fall, because winter is cold. Most flu's never develop into pneumonia  ie. when the virus gets into your lungs . But if they do, it's the usually severe kind. This is why Senku was excited previous episode it was a bacterial infection. Bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics. If it was a virus, there isn't much he could have done.",0

Just because two characters are blonde with colorful eyes do not mean, they're directly related to each other. Especially in 3500 years, with none of the village members having Byakuya's traits. The entire generation could come from Shamil, Connie, Darya and Yakov with no Lilian and Byakuya influence. Neither manga nor anime showed such something like they having children, but taking care of others' children. Even when Lilian died there were four kids. Two were obviously the russian couple's children, and the other two with brown hair were Shamil's and Connie's  even one having the exact eye color tone of Shamil's . To make a straightforward approach like in your logical way of seeing it, Lilian and Ruri do not even have the same eye color as Lilian. They're green unlike Lilian's blue eyes.",2

586,"Sorry to resurrect an old comment, but in case you are still wondering, names are kind of a different beast. You can reasonably take any reading for a kanji and say it is read that way in your name. Hell, there are even readings for some kanji that are pretty much only seen in names. The mere fact that Japanese kanji don't have just a single reading means you can do a lot of shit. People don't really do this in real life that I've ever seen, but to borrow your Death Note example, Light's name is written with 光 IIRC, and read as ライト  raito . So pretty much any time he would write his name for someone he doesn't know he would have to tell them both how it is read and how it is written. I guess the conclusion that I am trying to show from this long spiel is that there are no set-in-stone rules for name readings.    That being said, you can probably find instances where it happens outside of names too. Common tendencies can help one out but Japanese pronunciation can be weird.",2

Adopted  edit Senku as his own and raised him      Gave everything to his son that was required for nuturing his scientific curiosity, even sold his own car to get Senku a bunch of scientific presents      Went through personal water training hell just so that he can pay pack Senku for his help and fulfill his wish to become an astronaut      Single handedly saved his fellow astronauts, including a 10+ hour trip in a rowboat      Designed a complete book worth of stories just so that future humanity wouldn’t have to restart from complete zero      All while designing it specifically to help out Senku thousands of years later, filling out his promise to bring him back souvenirs      Spent every moment of his remaining life helping out humanity all by himself, and his son who he knew will never meet again     God amongst men. ",1
629, MC Akio begs to differ. ,1
630,At the very least he's the best  anime dad  of the year        goblet1 ,1
631,"That could indeed be a proper discussion, still  one  other would give a decent fight.",1
632,I think in the grand scheme of things Byakuya did more and had a greater impact on the story than either of those two both but Yeah Thors and Byakuya are pretty tied for Dad of the year.,1
633,Fight? These lads would sit down and have the chat of a life time with each other,1
634,was half expecting airi's stepdad,1
635,We all know Askeladd is the best Askedadd,1
636,ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH!,2
637,"Does Asura from Asura's Wrath count?    Because if not, yeah, absolutely.",1
638,"     Wait what, I don't think this was brought up in this episode",2
639,"I think it was a throwaway line with absolutely no significance in the manga, so there is no spoiler to worry about, apologies though.",1
640,Oh alright then,1
641,Yeah I'm thinking this is a slight anime spoiler,2
642,wait when does it say that byakuya is the son of his best friend,2
643,"Well it was subtle but a spoiler none the less, ill be more careful in the future",1
644,You have not even heard it all. He is bestest.,1
645,"for me it's whitebeard, his story is more epic",1
646,Well the bar isn?t really high when it comes to shonen dad.     But hey I'll drink to that!,1
647,What spoiler?,2
648,"    holdme     That was pretty great! Those 6 really deserved their own anime, though...",1
649,"Well you're in luck, Boichi  the artist of the series  is doing a spin off for Byakuya alongside the original series starting next issue of jump.",1
650,     Fuck Yeah!    Me:   Remembers Their Story is Pretty Fucking Sad and Ends up in Tragedy      Fuck No!,0
651,You gotta remember though. None of us are getting out of here alive.,1

656,I'd read this.,1
657,the first chapter is already out! @Jaiminisbox,2
658,"I read through the official translation  and release, scans are leaked out early  so that means Sunday for me. I do recommend it, it's literally free if you follow week to week and only have to pay for access to the backlog  and even then it's extremely affordable ",1
659,What's the title of it? I'm going to keep an eye out for it.,1
660,I believe it's Dr. Stone Reboot,2
661,Do you think its gonna contain manga spoilers for anime watchers?,2
662,"First chapters has no spoilers for anime only watchers, not sure if it will keep going that way though. Seeing how it centers on the six's time on Earth it will probably not spoil anything and only include some references at most, since most of the story should happen a long time in the past and in a distant place from where the anime is currently at.",2
663,"Probably slight spoilers for things that happened in the past that the main story covers, but it shouldn't spoil anything from the present I'd imagine.",1
664,ya i pretty much always double read the manga chapters. First time whatever scan drops on friday whenever - ,2
665,Would it contain spoilers from beyond the anime?,2
666,Its a spin-off featuring Byakuya. Anything it shows has to be between the petrification and the his death basically just fleshing out the backstory of the village ,2
667,Probably that would show how they manage to continue the humanity by themselves!,1
668,You'll have to venture into doujiinshi territory for that,2
669,"As a degenerate, can't wait until the Lillian doujins spawn",2
670,Do we know if it spoils anything from the main series?,2
671,"It may, there is at least another key Byakuya flashback down the line  way past the point the anime could reach .",2
672,I know but that's not an anime!,2
673,"Well, if it is popular it sure will be in a few years.",2
674,It's confirmed to have 9 chapters I think. Perhaps an OVA,2
675, Make it happen!   shutupandtakemymoney ,1
676,I don't even know if I want to read it now that I know the ending...,1
677,including the racy scenes and partner swaps?,2
678,"Ask & you shall receive, huh?",2
679,Now this is the spin-off everyone wants     looks at Shield Hero's spin-off about the Spear Hero ,1
680,That's amazing no way,1
681,Woah I didn't think there's much more  of a story to tell...unless Senku's dad is a mentor figure and the main character is one of the kids.,1
682,Is the spin off of them landing on Mars?,2
683," Luckily a spinoff is going to be released soon , and the timing could not be better.",1
684,Already released and translated as of last night,1
685,"Maybe it's because I'm a guy, but the theme of a father trusting and loving his son so much made me tear up a ton the last two episodes. Already liked the relationship back when they showed that he sold his car just to buy science stuff for Senku, and I'm so glad that this cour's ending song is about Senku and him",1
686,Yeah. It’s their relationship and simply the immeasurable gap in time that has me tearing up,1
687,"     that doesn't happen a lot, often the father is just Hitler.",1
688,"Pneumonia is a fucking bitch, I don't want to believe the russian scientists died, i really don't...  But it's hard to believe otherwis e, the fact they died they died trying to save their friend just makes this harder. At least their legacy lived on trough their children.",0
689,"     Yeah but i mean, in what world did it make sense for BOTH of them to go? Not only where they both doctors but they had fucking children? send one of them or one of the others so the kids had at least one parent left.",0
690,Better survival chances with two people i guess.,1
691,"I know that, but it would make more sense to NOT send both parents of the children.",1
692,"Parents need a date night together once in a while.  Y'know, go see a movie, like the Little Mermaid.   Under the Sea ",2
693,I imagine it's the same logic as Chrome and Kohaku from the other episode. They don't want to agree with any plan that makes it okay for one of them to not come back.,1
694,"It kinda had to be them. You'd have to send two for the best chance of survival. You obviously couldn't send the sick girl and sending her husband would be pretty cruel, and if he died at sea and she died from pneumonia then their kids are now orphans, so you'd still have orphaned kids. So you're left with the two who left or byakuya and the singer. The singer would unfortunately be useless, as she says later she doesn't speak Japanese, the two that went were doctors, so even if they didn't read Japanese they had a decent shot of figuring out what medicine was what and bringing back what they needed. So, you're left with the two who left and byakuya, who was already likely coming up with the 100 tales, knowing that long term survival may depend on them. Leaving just the two who left.    Edit: fixed a word",2
695,"she dosent read japanese she speaks it fine    also medicine tend to be printed in multiple languages and the active ingredient is always printed in english. e.g penicillin, paracetemol, methylphenidate hydrochloride",1
696,"Yea, that's the word I thought I fixed. And even if it's in a language she speaks, she may not kow what she's looking for",1
697,Am I the only one confused why they seem to be in the middle of a deserted island tho? Didn't they land near and or on Japan. Wouldn't they have access to all the technology and infrastructure available in the country? It wasn't like the stone came and ripped all technology off of earth.,0
698,"They landed on a small island that a recluse had settled and had a farm on. Just like senku thousands of years later, they were starting with virtually nothing, spending most of their time just surviving, barely able to make any progress. They likely were trying to build boats capable of getting all of them to the mainland safely, but couldn't before the first girl got sick. The two doctors took a risk and tried to get to the mainland with what they had, but it doesn't look like the ever made it back.",2
699,"Yea, the plot armor is thick on this one.  In all those years, you'd think they would be able to build a sturdy ship and sail to civilization.",0
700,None of them are shipwrights. You really think they would have the knowledge required to pull off such a feat?,0
701,"They did, the village isn't on the island where they landed",2
702,Your comment made me realize that 3 of the 6 people in the space station were Russian. So the village is mostly Russian descended.,2
703,2 russians are dead lol,1
704,They had children before dying...,2
705,and to think he's always 'what if ' or 'let's wait' man.,2
706,"I think the best part about this show is just how human senku is. I mean, sure hes a super genius and all, but he's still human. He makes mistakes. And then there's byakuya. The man was such a devoted father that he literally sent the last hope of human survival on a trip to Japan just so he could try to help his son even a little. And honestly, this show is way more emotional than I thought it would be, and it just keeps getting better. And I don't believe they arent related. They look so similar. But atleast it's less creepy now with kohaku.",1
707,Imagine waking up after all this and figuring out that your dad trusted you that all this time ,1
708,Imagine Senku counting to the 100th year realizing his Dad may have passed away already,2
709,His dad wouldn’t last a year in an unmanned spaceship. I bet that thought was baked into the cake,2
710,Assuming he hadn’t hoped for his dad to be petrified as well.,2
711,And I thought that it was sort of impressive how much Senku trusted Taiju to still be concious through the pertification.,1
712,He knew,2
713,the extend scenes and lilians songs are a great addition,1
714,"And I find it incredibly impressive that they seem to have hired a native English speaker. Don't get me wrong, love me some engrish, but the fact that they went just that extra step to make it more realistic really shows the care they're putting into this show.",1
715,"Yeah, but it really takes me out of it when we switch to a completely different voice, I feel it might have just been better to have the singer get a coach and speak Japanese for Lillian so it isn't such a jarring switch",0
716,It takes me out as well. When she starts singing it doesn't feel like it's actually her.,0
717,"Same, not to mention the fact that the voice is heavily edited with post-processing effects. Makes these scenes that are probably supposed to be profound and emotional just come off extremely jarring.",0
718,I suck at recognizing voices but I don't know if they hired a native speaker or it is just  her VA  who actually knows English.,2
719,They put last episodes song to Youtube and credited the singer as Laura Pitt-Pulford.,2
720,"Yeah, and a quick google search shows shes a British stage actor",2
721,i got goosebumps everytime  she sings,1
722,Intreating Engrish actually has been used to describe hybrid English combined with Japanese words. I have read you must learn some of these to be fully fluent talking casual street in Japan. But in the Anime fandom having a Japanese Accent is called Engrish when no hybrid words are used.,2
723,Everything has a reason.,1
724,"I don't think the ISS burning up on reentry was in the manga, but my goodness was that a beautiful cut. No sound, just fantastic animated destruction, reminiscent of Gravity.",1
725,It reminded me of the comet from Your Name. Both being very beautiful shots.,1
726,Made me wonder how long the IRL ISS will last if the entirety of humanity stopped doing anything to it like this show.,1
727,"Gotchu fam.    This post has a detailed graph and explanation.     It's not exact, but TLDR, the graph tapers off at around   460 days and the line doesn't show anything below 100 kilometers, I'm assuming that's when the ISS starts burning up in orbit. So a little over a year and a half and not the 3 years we see the show depict.         That question is pretty interesting though, as it's planned to let the ISS go during this generation. So we might witness something along those lines in the coming years.",2
728,Everytime this show reminded me how Senku manages to count seconds just add more respect to this character! How he had a tear on his father's grave was ten billion percent best scene in this episode which is one of the best of this series.,1
729,Oh my god. You captured my thoughts for the last scene.    Even when I was reading the manga. A science guy is still a human after all. Feeling. Fleeting.  Emotions. Primal. They. Linger.,1
730,"     I guess the shipping is going to be less creepy  though they're so many generations apart it didn't matter to begin with , but do people really think that Senku is going to develop feelings for anyone? Hell, I don't think Kohaku is interested in him in that way.",2
731,     this where I would post all her thirsty panels if I wasn't so lazy. Why do you think she blushed? She's been after that big brain since he made the pulley to save her.,2
732,Thank fuck someone else recognises this - I'm pretty sure the people who think Senku will pursue a relationship are just projecting their own feelings onto him. He has never shown even a  jot  of interest for that sort of a relationship.,1
733,senku might not want it but kohaku sure does and kohaku's definitely the type of girl ho gets what she wants,2
734,"Same with Kohaku. Somehow it doesn't even cross their mind that she could way too preoccupied with her own family issues to think about relationships. Even if he cured her sister and they're great friends, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.    For all we know, he could end up with ""feed me"" girl somewhere down the line. This show knows people and how they operate, so nothing can be assumed here since it'll be realistic in some way.",1
735,"Also worth to note how while he is genius, he respects others strenghts and knows his own weaknesses",2
736,"     and he relies on others! I feel like a lot of the time that there's a super genius character, all they need is an assistant to say ""lol i dun get it"" as they do everything alone. Senku understands his limitations and gives others the opportunity to provide their own skills. even if he likes to make fun of everyone, you can tell that he genuinely respects them.",2
737,"The part I loved in that scene is how you kind of see the moment that this all becomes  real  for him.  He's all talk, been all ""yup, figured that, knew that"" this whole series.  But then you get that close up of his eyes at Byakuya's grave.      The best I can compare it to is, say, you have a deceased relative and you just smelled something that reminded you of a dish they always made.  It's like a well-aimed cannonball to your mental defenses.",1
738,Well Japan actually part of the Earth farthest away from start of petrification process. The son part was a extra bonus.,1
739,"That was a big appeal to the series for me, as well.  When it comes to genius characters there's a tendency to write them as insufferable.  Think the Tony Stark Dr. House model of ""I'm a crass, arrogant jackass, but you all just have to put up with it because I'm so amazing at my job!"" that is apparently very appealing to audiences but which I've always found kinda... well, insufferable.         The other big trend with them is to make the cynical and, if not full-on nihilistic, then at least pessimistic and withdrawn.        Senku plays at being the former.  He jokes about viewing others as a source of labor for his ambitions, but his actions run contrary to that.  He never makes another person take a risk when he could take the risk himself, even when logic would dictate that anyone else present would be a much lesser risk to humanity's survival  as Chrome pointed out a while back , and he seems to have a general love of humanity and the potential of the human race, which is basically the singular driving force behind his entire enterprise.  He freely admits that for society to function, there are a number of rolls that need to be filled by the strong, the smart, the hardworking, and the dexterous, and that none of these rolls is any more or less important than the others.          It's a cool take on the character archetype.  I'm a fan.",1
740,"It's definitely a refreshing take on a genius character, especially considering how the trend recently has been to make geniuses eccentric, socially inept, borderline autistic savants. Not that I don't love a lot of characters in that trope, it's just really cool to see someone as straight forward and ballsy as Senku for a change.",1
741,When I see byakuya I think of byakuya from bleach.  Completely different than dr stone byakuya,2
742,They also went to Japan since it was the furthest away from where they saw the light start in South America so they were hoping people there weren't hit by it,2
743,"He's just an extremely nihilistic and logical centered individual, but he's prone to the same feelings as we all, he's just more resistant to crying than most people.",1
744,"He may look cold at times, but ""nihilistic"" is completely different, it means you don't believe in anything and think nothing is really of value. Senku is an idealist, he believes unflinchingly in science, the pursuit of knowledge, the power of humanity. He's absolutely the opposite of a nihilist.",1
745,How is Senku a nihilist?,2
746,He's not. Pragmatic maybe.,2
747,     Lmao the best part of the show is that senku is human,1
748,"""Don't worry lioness, we can do tons of scientific experiments together, we're not blood related after all.""",2
749,Which means their children will be the first non-incest babies in several thousand years.,2
750,Unless Taiju and Yuzuriha beat them to it.,2
751,They will be superior children!,1
752,It's a 50 50 shot at dad's brains and mom's brawn or mom's brains with dad's brawn.,2
753,"She's got a decent brain, caring personality and strong sense of justice. It would be a win anyway.",2
754,"Well you know what they say, if at first you don't succeed, try and try again ",2
755,"""Damn were weak and stupid""",2
756,     Just scientific ones? Or...,2
757,Everything is scientific.,2
758,I like the way you think... You'll go far :p,1
759,They aren't blood related? That means he doesn't have to worry about boning his great 300-grand niece.,2
760,He didn't really have to worry if that wasn't the case either tbf.,2
761,The blush kohaku had while asking if they were relatives is a scene to behold though!,1
762,That was a top-tier blush right there        kawaii     All aboard the SS Senkohaku!        piracy ,1
763,"Yeah, at this point they're so far away that it wouldn't be any different than if they were had no common ancestor. Actually if you take 2 random people from the same region in the same country, their odds of having a common ancestor would be pretty high.",2
764," Oh what the heck, he'll bang her anyway .",1
765,Why waste time pursuing sex when you could pursue space instead?,2
766,You take two random people from opposite sides of the globe and there's a 100% chance they have a common ancestor.    You take a random person and a bacterium at the bottom of the ocean and there's also a 100% chance they have a common ancestor.    This is how evolution works. There's only one tree of life on Earth. We're all part of a single unbroken chain of reproduction and mutation.,2
767,"If the genes stayed static, sure, but we're not considering 3700 years of epigenetics and other environmental factors that could cause mutations. Heck, considering how people were in 1700 BC, there could even be subtle anatomical differences that we aren't aware of.",2
768,"Lets assume that Senku was Byakuya's kid, he'd have 1 2 his genes. The first child Byakuya had with Lillian will also have 1 2 of Byakuya's genes.     Given what we know about genetics,  Senku and his half-sibling will only share about 25% of the genes because the half that is inherited from a parent is random and there should only be about a half overlap.     Now, lets say the child of Connie and Shamil  CSK  has a child with Byakuya's & Lilian's kid  BLK . This 2nd generation child will have 1 4 of Byakuya's genes and only be 12.5% related to Senku. 1 6 is 16.67%, so we've already diluted Byakuya's genetics down below 1 6 in 2 generations. And it'll continue to become smaller and smaller with each generation, barring excessive amounts of sibling incest. Throw in the fact that with 100+ generations, there is bound to be some naturally occurring genetic mutation, none of the villagers would test positive as a relative to Senku given how many generations have passed.",2
769,"If they all intermarried equally, the genes for an average villager would remain 1 6th of Byakuya's, minus any mutations.  No fresh DNA is being introduced at all during that time EXCEPT through mutation.",2
770,"You're assuming that there's an 100% reproductive rate which goes against natural selection. One way to look at it is how inbreeding is a self-selecting process.    Lets say Byakuya had recessive genetics for heart disease. 4-generations down the road, these genetics meet up in an offspring line and 2 boys are birthed from these parents.    B1 and B2. B1 did not inherit any heart disease genes whereas B2 did. These two form branches from same Byakuya family. The branch of B1 will be healthy and flourish over the next few generations whereas the branch of B2 will be plagued with heart disease and early deaths. Early deaths and stigmas will mean that B2 heirs will struggle to reproduce in the same numbers and its heirs will be less desirable mates compared to B1 heirs, and given a few generations it would not be surprising that the B2 line dies out because they were unable to reproduce. Repeat this across the various branches over countless generations and you'll see that the Byakuya gene for heart disease has vanished from the gene pool.     Lets say Senku is a carrier for this detrimental heart disease gene but it's recessive and does not manifest in him despite being a carrier. That is something that sets him apart from all of the villagers despite them having a common ancestor because that genetic expression has since been bred out over the countless generations.     Will the unmutated genetic expressions be 1 6 of Byakuya's if we assume all the genetics mutate at an equal rate? Sure, but that 1 6th is likely going to be very different than what Byakuya passed on to his kids given how homogenized populations tend of become as negative traits are bred out. Thus, it's inaccurate to say that Senku is going to be 1 6th related to any random villager.",2
771,Ancient Cultures normal practice of killing defective babies and not having anyone with known genetic problems reproduce aid what you wrote.,0
772,r theydidthegenetics,2
773,"fresh dna dosent have to be introduced just passed on differently which happens in meiosis you could effectively make two haploid cells with only ur genes and ""breed"" with youself and ur child would be guaranteed not to be genetically identical.",2
774,Umm... it’s not like all 6 astronauts mate to form a single child.,2
775,"No, but their children would mate each other and eventually every of their offspring would had all of the austronauts' gene",2
776,"You need to study up on genetics before you start throwing your emotional hunches around. Byakuya was almost certainly editor-retconned to be Senku's adoptive father because of people like you that don't understand genetics. Senku, even if not adopted, would not be related to people separated by 3700 years of generations.",2
777,Of course he doesn't need to worry - he's literally never shown a single sign of being interested in romantic or sexual relations.,2
778,It's generally agreed that this is a last minute change demanded by the editors in order to avoid incestuous relations between Senku and Kohaku.,2
779,It's the same logic as uncensored hentai being illegal while the same image with a single thin line drawn on it is legal. The moral lines are drawn and they're not worth fighting most of the time,0
780,"LOL yep good point. Japanese Censorship is Western Powers in particular American imposed. America demanded censorship be written into their post war constitution. Before that no sex censorship in Japan, with the fake prude and public lude in private culture going way back sexual images might have been restricted to where sold and when.   It's interesting how irrational the human conform to tribe culture, in this case Western Civilization, instinct is when a significant part of modern Japanese support a restriction that was forced on them.",1
781,"Most Anime:    ""I know we are brother and sister %1000 blood related but let's bang anyway!""    Dr. Stone:    ""We're hundreds of generations removed and likely have less shared genetics then me and the other unpetrified Asian guy but I'm still adopted anyway just so this isn't awkward.""",2
782,Any chance being related to the magazine the manga are published on? Are there any incestuous manga in the Weekly Shounen Jump?,2
783,Kinda funny when the whole village is built on   3700 years of nonstop incest.,2

787,Hold the D. Tsukasa is coming!,1
788,Ishigami D. Senku,2
789,Underrated comment right here.,1
790,"Yeah, that had to have been an editor input or something. Cause even if they were blood related, they're still hundreds of generations removed. No chance of any genetic irregularities from that coupling.",2
791,Senku is probably more closely related to Gen than to Kohaku  even if Byakuya was his real father ,2
792,"I mean Senku and Gen are both Japanese while Kohaku is 50% Russian, 16.66% Japanese and 33.33% America  Connie could potentially be part or fully Chinese by the last name of Lee, Lillian might be part or fully German with the last name Weinberg , so Senku and Gen are for sure more genetically related.",2
793,"If Byakuya was his real father, Senku and Kohaku would likely be about as closely related as second cousins are.",2
794,"Second cousins are fairly close, familialy, if not genetically. Kohaku and Senku are 3700 years and hundreds of generations apart. It’s like the factoid that something like 10% of the population is descended from genghis khan. After that stretch of time they would be so distantly related as to be not related at all.",2
795,The village's genetic diversity will not significantly increase over time. The number of generations doesn't matter because the DNA is all from the same 6 people.,2
796,DNA mutates randomly you know. Or else there wouldn't be many species or organisms at all.,2
797,"It does, but on a timescale of 3700 years it's not going to be nearly enough.",2
798,"Lmao dude sorry but you don't know what you're talking about.    Significant genetic variation can arise even after only a few generations. Why do you think antibiotic resistant bacteria are already popping up less than 100 years after antibiotics were introduced?    Just look at Darwins finches. I can't recall exactly  on mobile atm  but there was a hurricane in the 70's that blew 2 individuals of a continental species to the Galapagos islands and researchers observed the genesis of an entirely new finch species within the timeframe of a couple decades, just from those individuals breeding with 2 individuals of the native species and then their offspring breeding amongst each other.",1
799,I do know what I'm talking about. The rate that mutations arise in a population is directly proportional to the size of the population and inversely proportional to the generation time. Humans have a long generation time and the population in question is very small.,2
800,well fresh dna dosent need to be intoduced you see meiosis guarantees genetic variation. there is a step in the production of haploid cells that guaratees that there is variation  crossing over  if an egg and a sperm cell made using only ur dna was made and the egg became fertilised the resulting child would not be 100% genetically the same. also mutations,2
801,"Actually, I’m VERY convinced that the identity of Senku’s real dad will be a major reveal in the story later on.",1
802,"I'm pretty sure his birth parents are dead. And they were friends of Byakuya, so he took in their son.",2
803,"There is a single manga panel later that I base this on mostly, but that is spoiler territory so I’ll avoid that. We still don’t know anything at all about Senku’s real parents.",2
804,I appreciate that they fully went no chromo         toradorasalute ,1
805,"Guys, did you hear? Senku and the tribe are not blood-related!    On a more serious note, now that war is coming against the Tsukasa tribe, Senku is going to be making weapons again, hopefully, with science, they will defeat him without losing a lot of people.    And fuck, it seems that pneumonia was also a threat over there, if only they had landed closer to civilization. After this season is over I sure will enjoy reading the  spinoff , I wonder if the other two that went searching for antibiotics were able to survive elsewhere? Hopefully, that's the case and after the war is over their tribe will meet this one.     Here is a clip from last week's song. ",1
806,"If they landed on the mainland, there are a lot of problems with the narrative.    They could have been able to unpetrify the world themselves, since they would have access to labs and chemical depots. Assuming the petrification didn't just weaken over the 3700 years of course.    They could have left books or stone tablets behind and better educated their children so the society would have been vastly different.    In fact, all of the adults seem to have died pretty early because of the lack of medicine - so then it would make sense that they didnt have enough time to properly educate the kids and continue a more modern society. That's especially relevant since if they could properly teach the kids how to read, they could harvest information from the world once the descendants got off the island.",1
807,     also the education would naturally degrade over hundreds of generations...,2
808,"That's somewhat true, but at least being able to read and write would be a pretty big deal. That's easy enough to pass down, and it means at least one person could learn a lot through found reference materials. There would at least be common cultural knowledge of the world before.     This way the children only know the islands, the tales, and to some extent spoken language. They pass down a lot more otherwise. The blank gravestone for Byakuya implies that none of the children even knew written language.",1
809,"I wrote in detail post how the stories had to be plan B. and your right either the adults died before the higher level civilization retain plan was able to be implemented or a coup caused a Dark Age with all modern knowledge and and written records destroyed.   I would expect many violent overthrows in 3,700 years so the story plan B was a wise one in that storytelling in real world has been shown to carry stories intact over very long periods of time.   No way they picked a best warrior became chief as the form of Government. I'm sure it probably was Town Hall everyone votes government at first.",1
810,they died before higher civ    byaku's blank gravestone is proof,2
811,"Maybe, maybe not, they would have no clue where to start with depetrification, the only reason senku was able to figure it out was because he depetrified and could study the circumstances that lead to it.",2
812,"I can't help but feel like ""just trying some acid"" is a relatively logical thing, and the acid they used is something incredibly prolific in chemistry",1
813,"Not really, I mean like senku showed at the beginning, petrification turns someone to stone all the way through, no reason to think acid would be what would fix that.",1
814,Laminated books pages would have been the best if they had access to create them. I'm not sure if anything else could last as long as that except for undisturbed stone works.,2
815,easy the dumbest one was the one left alive,1
816,"With the current technology & workforce, Senku has the tools to create primitive firearms so I can't see things going too well for Tsusaka.",0
817,"Hell, if he really wants to kill then all, he could make something nasty just with sulfur. But well, whatever he does, those guys are fucked for sure.",0
818,Oh Senku could immediately jump to chemical warfare but that doesn't seem like his style to me.    Not a manga reader but I may give it a go at the end of the season.,1
819,He builds moe because the power of moe wins over all.    Tsukasa undergoes gender change to become magical girl.,2

847,This EP hit me more than I thought to be honest...,1
848,"At the start I thought this show was like one of many Isekai, in that just a genius guy overpowering through medieval world by his scientific modern knowledge.    I didn't expect amazing time travel  sorta  emotional heritage story, which I always love to death. And it doesn't feel total fantasy but actually is believable Sci-Fi at the same time.    This might be my new 10 10 after very loooong time of disappointing seasons of watching airing shows blindly  though I tend to avoid hyped shows and only watch mediocre ones     Also this season's ED is becoming hitting me harder and harder.",0
849,If you think this is a 10 10 already wait until we get to the later parts and season 2,1
850,     Is that hypothetical or is season 2 confirmed?,2
851,Not confirmed but I mean the series is successful and there is enough source material for 35+ more episodes so I expect a s2 soon after the current one finishes.,1
852,"Good, you should be.",1
853,"At first with Taiju and Tsukasa, it all seemed like a typical Isekai. But man, once Senku reaches the village it became whole new thing.",1
854,The last tombstone without a name kinda hints that they failed to teach the children properly. All the specialist knowledge died off immediately due the pneumonia leaving the Singer and the Teacher to pass on knowledge to the next generation.  Kinda explains why the village is stuck at the stone age,2
855,     I thought they just wanted it to be in the shape of a rocket tbh.,1
856,"Considering the 100 tales were all passed down by spoken word as well, makes sense. Plus writing is non existant within Ishigami Village, thus why the Tournament Bracket had the art kid drawing them out each time.",2
857,Oh good point. I have already wrote the storytelling a plan B and that they probably hoped to have reading and writing survive along with a significantly higher technology level.,1
858,"no, they know how to write, but not kanjis",2
859,"He's talking about how everyone except Byakuya's grave is marked in  English , meaning that the kids failed to learn the writing system.",2
860,"I'm also curious- did the kids just somehow manage to survive and, later on, breed on their own?   Little kids?? I was hoping the adults would last until they were teens or something",1
861,"I really love how this episode just went from hopeful to bittersweet halfway through. We know it works out in the end and Ishigami village survives, but watching all but one of the founders die one after another and Byakuya's breakdown over it being from such a simple disease was heartbreaking. But it was a good thing Byakuya was the last survivor since he's the one with the most experience with children out of the six.",1
862,"Something small I loved about this episode and the previous was the use of silence.    You get so used to being surrounded by sound, and every second of your media having some sort of noise, that when they make the conscious choice for pure silence, it stands out.    That little bit with the ISS after the whole thing with Shamil and Connie was honestly kind of haunting.",1
863, More like Dr. Symphogear ,2
864,"Meteoroid-falling, burning, and disappear, then...",2
865,"I had the exact same thought when I saw that. Falling, burning and disappear...",2
866,Those types of asteroids aren't exclusive to Symphogear.,2
867,"How they're individually colored, the pose, and the number are all similar enough that it was the first thing I thought of as well. I even paused to compare the number and arrangement. Obviously not a reference, just a coincidence, but it's funny how the two scenes came so close in time to each other.",1
868, It's a terrible day for rain. ,0
869,"Damn, everyone  died pretty young . I wonder how those kids even lasted. Unless Byakuya just manage to live that THAT long to raise them all.",0
870,"I think that's implied. Or at least, he lived long enough for the 100 tales to root and guarantee their survival",2
871,Byakuya: ok kids incest is a good thing!,2
872," ""the last flash back about Byakuya showed that he lived up to his 70s"" ",2
873,"Well when they showed Byakuya's gravestone, there were kids running around. So that's what I'm confused about. Unless they were the kids of the first children that were born... but theres no hints to that",2
874,"  FUCK YOU DISEASE,   FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU.    This episode was so beautiful i have no words for it. I genuenely wanted to cry on hiw beautiful the narrative on life and love was.    What hit me the hardest was Shamill narrative's, he was a man in life who had nothing to live for other than seeking glory trough work,  but then he found happiness     I really, really wanted Senku's dead to marry Lillian and have children, they were made for each other...  but  i guess no ... Guess DILFS don't get love, but they were a duo to the end. I hope they clear up if they had children or not.    It's a shame the ISS members were unable to get into the mainland, they would have been easily be able to save mankind...",1
875,"It's implied they did, as they are the ones that told the 100 stories. The other two couples disappeared died of pneumonia.",2
876,"They didn't showed a marrieage scene or they having children, which is why it's also implied the opposite, i hope this is cleared with time.",1
877,I thought the two extra kids with super blonde hair were there's.,2
878,And Ruri & Kohaku are clearly her descendants,1
879,Shamil was also quite blonde though.,2
880,Then how do you explain Ruri and Kohaku being near identical to Lilian?,2
881,"it's implied by the aspect of some of the Ishigami people, Kohaku and her sister are surely Lillian descendents and a lot of other people have blond hairs that is not a japonaise trait...",2
882,"Yeah, but he says it.     He says clearly ""I had the chance to have a wife and kids"". Or at least someone translated it like this in italian so I assume he did.",2
883,willing to bet kohaku is descended from byaku and lillian,1
884,Well they have the same hair colour. And I'd assume Lillian was the first priestess.,1
885,"It was gut wrenching. The thing is these 6 survivors are all genius' in their own right. You have to be of a special breed to be on the ISS. They're all genius' in one way or another. The only one you could argue isn't is Lilan, but even then being musically talented is its own form of genius.    Shamil is intelligent to the 1% and the woman he loves dies of Pneumonia and there was nothing he could do because they were on a deserted island back at step 1. That's got to be soul destoying. You're smart enough, and devoted enough to get to space. You literally conquered the planet itself and then crash right back to reality to lose someone to a disease your ancestors conquered 400 years before.",0
886,"Ya it was really sad. It reminds me how much we take our godlike technology for granted.    They didn't even get to conquer darkness. I remember during a recent hurricane of power being out for a couple weeks. Driving on the partially flooded roads in the aftermath at night was eerie, like I was gonna get swallowed by the darkness as I was never used to it.",0
887,     Lillian geniuses is from arts and crafts rather than science.,1
888,I quite literally said that.,1
889,     uhhh isn't it obvious ruri and kohaku are lillian's descendants? they look almost exactly like her. and given that lillian and byakuya were pretty obviosly a couple I think that's confirmed enough,2
890,Such a touching and emotional episode man. Byakuya is now Best Dad throughout all anime.,1
891,"wait, Senku and the dad Byakuya aren't blood related?    the ships are alive again",1
892,good news for the village a new set of genes are added  to the pool.,1
893,"Also, talking about ships,  that one         ilovethiskindofshit ",1
894,Umm I think that bit where Byakuya is carrying Lillian was when she died,2
895,Yeah but you got to question how the genetic pool was not exhausted after 3 or 4 generations. Its just one of those things you have to accept along with Tsukasa punching an adult lion to death.,2
896,ok lets start    6 people can definitely repopulate the earth.    international space station = large gene pool  actually larger genepool the native populations of the world. aboriginals. native americans etc actually had a smaller genepool so surprise  senku would be more related to gen then to kohaku even if byaku was his blood father.    and also a small gene pool  and by extension inbreeding  wouldn't affect humans nearly as badly as other animals.    biggest issue is environmental changes screwing over the population as no indivuals have a trait to survive the environmental change well humans solved this issue   we are not built to handle cold at all but we made clothes  our ability to make stuff and build shelter fixes this issue.    now issues with inbreeding. surprisingly the show accidently  or on purpose  covered their bases really well. As long as the parents are not predisposed to genetic illnesses.birth defects are actually really unlikely. also the chances of genetic disorders appearing via inbreeding is way exaggerated assume u had a clone that was genetically identical to you but female  only the sex chromosome changed  say your have an avg predisposure to genetic disorders and you fucked said clone and had a child. your chances of having a totally normal baby is 999 1000 99.9% NANI YEP totally fine. this is a 20   increase in chance but its still 20   a really small chance. now breeding between siblengs increases the chance of a child suffering genetic disorders by 10   so 1999 2000 babies will be healthy.    wow right    then consider that astronauts are all genetically screened for any genetic illness that appears more then once in 100000 births. that base is pretty damn well covered.,2
897,"Yea, that's not realistic.  Most people would hold back because lions are, well, not quite endangered but ""vulnerable.""",0
898,"With a 3700 year gap in the generations, they wouldn't have had to worry if they were blood related anyways.",2
899,I know one ship that didn’t come back alive in that episode,1
900,Yay for no incest,2
901,Bit sad to see the rip ships and I'm REALLY curious if it were only the 2 couples that paired up.        shirayukieavesdrop ,0
902,"It's kinda obvious Byakuya and Lillian had kids, since Kohaku and Ruri share Lillian's eyes.",2
903,"RIP Byakuya's genes, I don't see him in any of the villagers.",2
904,I think a little bit of Byakuya is in everyone that first trusted Senku.,2
905,"If I remember correctly, back when Senku got into the village and asked the girls their type, there was a girl who looked like Nico  black twintails and red eyes . Byakuya has red eyes and probably had black hair when he was younger.    So she can be his descendant.",2
906,"One of Ruris aides has white hair kinda like Byakuya, maybe he's a descendent?",2
907,I think it is safe to say all three couples had children.,1
908,I don't think they said it but... it'd be a real waste if they didn't at least have kids!,0
909,I think it is implied that Byakuya and Lillian smashed.,1
910,"You can see traits from all the astronauts in the villagers, so they must have all had kids.",1
911,Magma literally looks like buff blond clean shaven byakuya,1
912,"I am now emotionally attached, thank you very much.",1
913,That's one way to make my heart ache.,1
914,That was a pretty wholesome story. Byakuya managed to put enough care to push things forward so that eventually Senku would have the bits and pieces he would need in order to make advancements. He really was a good dad.    Tsukasa is coming alright. Now to find out how Senku will push back against Tsukasa.,1
915,he could just go fuck you chemical warfare he has everything he needs to make hella horrifying gases and bombs     ;    but he probs will just make firearms,2
916,"I cried, couldnt help it. Glorious  episode.",1
917,"Bruh, I had a tear in my eye throughout most of this episode. Idk what I found so emotional about this episode.",1
918,"Senku and Byakuya's connection beyond time is done beautifully, and they'll still have moments like this in the show. Especially some that will only be covered in an eventual second season, that seeing adapted will just fucking slay me  :'|",1
919,First time seeing him cry and then the ending. This is torture.,1
920,"Byakuya is such a bro father. His love for Senku transceended time itself, such a beautiful narrative.    I wish my dad was 10% like him.",1
921,btw byakuya was seriously rowing for so long and yet no one took his place on their way back.,1
922,"They were tired from zero-gravity jet lag, I guess?",1
923,man buff af and that stamina then he did claim he can swim 10 km fully clothed,1
924,The other astronauts were tired.,1
925,"I was really upset watching each member of the crew die, they were all awesome.    Seeing Senku actually cry a bit was really nice. Despite his collected demeanor, he's still human.",1
926, WarArc,2
927,Dr. Stone is shaping up to be a classic,1
928,I really have some new found appreciation for all the scientific development we have gone through after watching today's episode,1
929,"Well now we finally see why they couldn't teach future generations anything more than a bunch of stories. That damn pneumonia killed the adults before the kids could grow up to understand them    I knew it was coming but I still couldn't stop from crying. This story may be one of inspiration in the resilience of humanity, but it all started with a huge tragedy.    Also I still can't believe Senku and his dad aren't blood related. They look so alike...",1
930,Seeing your team dieing one by one together with their knowledge is just sad,0
931,editor forced that so senku can bone kohaku without it being seen as incest by people who don't understand genetics    i want doujins,2
932,Man... Byakuya was so cool. Wish we got to see a little more of him.,1
933,Just be patient =  every episode with him is gold,2
934,"So it seems like the next episodes will finally be the clash between the two empires? Super curious to see that one.      The OP kinda spoils a bit already, as we can see a few of them with Katanas, but I wonder how far they could've gotten,  after  the age of swords. I wonder if he was able to at least build one of those super old rifles where you have to reload each shot. That would already be a game changer",1
935,"This season barely covers half of the manga, I'm so hoping for more seasons",1
936,I'll probably go for the manga when this season finishes lol,1
937,"ya, me too.",1
938,i mean senku could easily just go fuck you chemical warfare it is he has everything to make hella scary shit. even sulfur on its own is deadly,2
939,"Doubt they will straight up make rifles, more likely to make cannons, and with tsukasa empire consist of revived young people, they would know what a freaking cannon is and a warning shot to show it is working would be sufficient to make them know attacking is a bad idea.",2
940,They already got poison gas from the lake. He should be able to make poison weapons too.,1
941,he can make alot of dumb scary chemicals with what he has access to. lets just say if senku has no mercy the attackers wont be having fun.    as a chemistry student i can think of 10 scary as shit things senku can make it what he has. involving set literally anything on fire    stink up shit    melt ur face off    burn ur lungs t death,2
942,What a fucking sad episode. And then non blood relation made my Senku x Kohaku ship still alive.,0
943,"It woulda shipped regardless. Using modern day as example, if I had a common ancestor with someone from 1000 BCE, we would have like .0001% gene similarity. 3000 years is a long time for humans.",1
944,"If each generation counted as 25 years which obviously isn't the case because they die younger and so will have to reproduce faster, then we would have  at least 148 generations separating Senku and Kohaku for these 3700 years.",2
945,The idol singing sounds like a princess breaking her chains in a Disney movie to me.,2
946,"While most people are talking about ships, I think you're forgetting that Senku's only love is science    Science is bae lol",1
947,Wait so those 6 people’s descendants were basically inbreeding for thousands of years? How come they arent looking like gnomes ?,2
948,"Three original females, three males. Its only a hundred and fifty to two hundred generations. We came out of the last twenty thousand year long ice age fairly well. And yes the hobbits were one of those groups, but long genetic separation and return to add long arc sustainable changes would be as necessary a tool as would incest.  Indigenous Australian indicators imply three males breeding with one female produced less sustainable genetic traits than five males with one female  otherwise they would all be three feet tall . They also had genetic introduction from multiple return groups, even a group with multiple females.",2
949,"It's also worth noting that they were all different nationalities, meaning a fair amount of genetic diversity right from the get go. Plus they were astronauts, while not guaranteed the likelihood of them having genetic problems that would eventually pop up would be lower than for the average person.",2
950,here is the convoluted over scienced version of the expanation    6 people can definitely repopulate the earth.    international space station = large gene pool  actually larger genepool the native populations of the world. aboriginals. native americans etc actually had a smaller genepool so surprise  senku would be more related to gen then to kohaku even if byaku was his blood father.    and also a small gene pool  and by extension inbreeding  wouldn't affect humans nearly as badly as other animals.    biggest issue is environmental changes screwing over the population as no indivuals have a trait to survive the environmental change well humans solved this issue   we are not built to handle cold at all but we made clothes  our ability to make stuff and build shelter fixes this issue.    now issues with inbreeding. surprisingly the show accidently  or on purpose  covered their bases really well.

951,woah,1
952,Extreme Incest use by horse and dog breeders probably gives the best answer. Even more than one generation of Father Daughter. This is how the German Shepard and many other Pure Breed Lines are made. They killed defective offspring and only let the healthiest offspring breed. As these practices are frowned on modern day you manly find them earlier in 1900's and late 1800's.,2
953,Ya there's just no way this face is the result of inbreeding.  ,0
954,Alright you convinced me,1
955,"you know why humans look the same vs other animals? because in the past all humanity died except 50.000, and we all lived in the same zone so we had to interbreed a lot",2
956,     ok lets start    6 people can definitely repopulate the earth.    international space station = large gene pool  actually larger genepool the native populations of the world. aboriginals. native americans etc actually had a smaller genepool so surprise  senku would be more related to gen then to kohaku even if byaku was his blood father.    and also a small gene pool  and by extension inbreeding  wouldn't affect humans nearly as badly as other animals.    biggest issue is environmental changes screwing over the population as no indivuals have a trait to survive the environmental change well humans solved this issue   we are not built to handle cold at all but we made clothes  our ability to make stuff and build shelter fixes this issue.    now issues with inbreeding. surprisingly the show accidently  or on purpose  covered their bases really well.

957,thank the animators. you would not want to see dr. stone as a life action series,1
958,"so... after 3700 years, population managed to advance by 34 people?  earlier episode said the village was about 40  thats.. awkward. and im going based on the 4 kids+2 adults. assuming the guy dies and those 2 that left for anti-biotics also died. Interesting turn out. I guess it makes it easier for the writer to make every character matter, but man the population really should be much larger. I was thinking the village was a few hundred years old not a few thousand.",2
959,starvation and sickness really helps keeping a population small,1
960,"if we started at that growth rate in the current world. we'd be at under 1 million people right now easily. thats a disgustingly low population growth. especially for already having ""one hundred tales"" to help them. current growth rate is 1.08%, theirs is at 0.052% ",2
961,just check the grow rate from 1800 to 1850 so low. in 1700 it took us 100 years to double the population,2
962,"Perhaps not everyone went to Japan from that island, i can't imagine everyone from a group agreeing to go and cross the sea.",1
963,I am assuming actually a great number of villages but spread all over the place with fairly great distances between them. I am not a reader but that the most logical answer.    Human tribe instinct will break a group into parts that hate each other on a regular basis so in reality humans rapidly spread out and give each other room if their room to give.   If your group seams to be dividing between two leaders over what seams to be petty and stupid reasons that the Human Tribe instinct at work. Outside help and group counseling might be able to overcome this along with knowledge that your instincts make mountains over moe hills might keep your group and your relationship together as a similar instinct tries to break up couples every four years on average.   This is also the cause of Racism which only evolved when people could no longer tell what tribe people were from. Before that you hated nearby tribes but not farther away than that normally. Thus no racism in Roman Empire has been documented and very little found for most of history as people could tell what tribe you were from.,0
964,"Good point actually, if Byakuya died not in Japan, how is his tomb there now",1
965,they island hopped so i expect that more islands  especially the original island  have populations,1
966,people left its not like you are forced to live in the same village you can pick a girl and leave,2
967,"Well that ended in a tragic way...       Glad  the kids             Instead of resolving Backstory, he is just  adding to the pile of questions      Now I want to know how exactly they ended up living together. He sold his freaking car for his adoptive son too!            Been playing some Rimworld lately and I can smell the preperation and outcome of the raid already",1
968,     More hats.,1
969,"I made the mistake of watching this week's ep during my lunch break at work. I had to avoid my colleagues going back to my desk in order to avoid awkward conversations about why tears were streaming down my face because of Japanese animation, FML.     But this was such an emotionally powerful episode. Senku coming to terms with the legacy left behind to him from his late father, seeing how Byakuya's last days played out, everything was so incredibly touching and heartfelt. For a show revolving around science it sure has a lot of heart.    HYPE for what looks like will be the start of a new arc though; war with Tsukasa's tribe! Did Gen sell out Senku and the others?",1
970," Onii-CHAN     the poor girl thought they had a Wincest going on.    Well, classic old school hentai where always family but NOT RELATED BY BLOOD     ;    What they should have done to, I mean Marriage and love between the 6 is cute, buuut they should have each porked each other to get more DNA combos. Creating a lot of half siblings and so on",1
971,Correct a different pairing every kid should have been the rule. Also killing any defective babies and castration and no breading of any defects not spotted at birth.,1

977,This episode was fucking insane,1
978,"Best part this episode: Senkuu isn't blood related to his dad! Meaning my ship of him and Kohaku isn't incest! Yay!    It made it better when Kohaku was blushing and asked if they were related, almost like she was hoping they weren't! The ship is real y'all!    I do realize after 3,700 years it wouldn't have mattered, but I am still glad the story played out this way instead! Wonder why his Dad was raising him? Hope we get the actual story about Senkuu's real parents.    I am loving the show so much right now. Also, I really think both these OP and ED are better than the first ones!  I love them so much.",1
979,"Holy moly the incest is even worse than i thought.    I'm surprised the villagers even look human and the worst they got is bad eyesight.    Well, who knows maybe there are other villages out there from people that broke free or the married couple founded another one.",0
980,do some killing of defective babies and not letting defects mate and you can avoid most of that.,0
981,The real science gift was the friends he made along the way,1
982,It was literally this lol,1
983,"Wow, what an episode. I teared up at least 3 times. Especially that last scene with Senku at the grave. Although I actually expected a bigger breakdown. Honestly it's amazing how well Senku is doing mentally considering he was stuck in the dark, immobile, counting for over 3000 years.",1
984,Senku's dad is just too awesome. He believed in him so much that he created a whole society with a culture just all for him.,1
985,lowkey created a senku religion 2,1
986,"Gotta say, I hate Tsukasa so much more after this episode. After all Senku's dad and the other astronauts gave, and suffered through, he's going to just throw it all away bc fuck adults? God seeing Senku kick his ass with science is gonna feel good.    Also, how dare you hate adults when Senku's dad exists",0
987,"So why couldn't that first team open the hatch and swim out instead of drowning? Aren't there emergency flotation devices in the landing pods?    They spent 10 hours strapped in upside down too. Shouldn't that lead to loss of consciousness due to all the blood pooling in the head?    If they were originally planning to land in South America, how the hell did they ""miss the target"" enough to land in Asia?    What's even the point of Senku being adopted instead of being Byakuya's biological son? I mean every single villager is already related to each other across like 100+ generations of incest.    All the founder waifus biting the dust within a few short years :     If Senku was petrified inside the school building, how did he wind up in a batcave? If the building fell to pieces around him, how did he wind up in one piece even?    And they landed on some small island, and the two who went to the mainland never returned. The village should've been founded on that island then, no? Why is it on the mainland now? If the villagers moved to the mainland in those 3700 years, they would've had to bring the founders' cemetery with them, and I doubt they had the technology to do so.",0
988,"They were trying to avoid South America, which is why they landed near Japan which is really far.",2
989,Yep japan a rather bad place to try to land but it being the exact opposite spot from where the petrification occurred made it the best spot to try. The land landing old Soviet system tries to land in a truly huge flat area. And that why the Soviets went land while American's went Sea. America does have huge flat areas but they have farms and small towns. The fact a tiny chance son would come back did not make the choice it just added to the choice.,2
990,Edit to Add. With much more knowledge on how to land things America does a good amount of land landings now in really big but not as huge as the old Soviet area.,2
991,"Not going to spoil, but most of these questions are eventually answered in the Manga.",2
992,"Yeah the location discrepancy with the Founders' Cemetery needs to be answered. If they were on an island of Japan it must have been remote if they weren't able to safely make the voyage to the mainland. But somehow the Founder's Cemetery is right outside the village, even though Senku and the others who were revived could just walk right over to the village without having to cross any bodies of water? There was also originally a village with farms and a rowboat on their island. Are you telling me no one there had any kind of modern boat to get back to the mainland? This is an island in modern Japan, not a secluded tribe in the Amazon.",0
993,"Founders were most likely the kids of the science people. It was said they took a trip to Japan by boat. And seeing as they were on Japan 3700 years later and that the game telephone was a thing with their past, most likely ""founders"" implies a few gens back.",2
994,That's it boys not blood related all the discussion of previous episode got there answer in this one!,1
995,One of the best episode in this series!,1
996,"It was   •́  ‿ ,•̀",2
997,"I'm surprised that so many fit, educated, and mostly young people are dying so quickly. It looks like all except for Byakuya died before the kids were even ten years old.",0

1001,your pretty damn close,1
1002,"Compared to the manga, the anime hits emotional beats really well. I thought that the manga would work better for this type of story and so I let my self read ahead, but the anime is really pulling through",1
1003,I'm reminded of the TNG episode where they are advising settler how the women would start having to take multiple husband's. And that was like with 100 people.    I guess the censors wouldn't allow depicting non-traditional family structures even when the apocalypse demands it.     Also why did Lilian die so young too? That's some bad fucking luck.,0
1004,Avoided the killing of defective young and not allowing older people with known genetic problems having children. Ancient cultures killing defective babies is the rule.   Without STD's human females had sex one or more time a day with four plus partners. Source Ted TV and 40 years of reading before that I can confirm the norm is for the tribal orgy or some sort of women sleep with whom ever the want to all the time is the human normal behavior. Why Euripean Explorers World Wide vastly different cultures and languages were often able to have everyone in the expeditions who wanted to have sex with a native girl on first arrival.     Love the flotillas of women with flowers greeting Captain Cooks boats wanting to have sex with the new men.     So genetic diversity is a priority in human behavior.     The extreme sex clamp downs are from STD's developing which can normally only develop at high population levels that with humans came with agriculture a very recent development in human history.     Human female base behavior 180 degrees different from what we assume modern day.,2
1005,So you saying girls all sluts???,2
1006,whats TNG?,2
1007,It's likely Star Trek The New Generation.,2

Physics, Chemistry and whatever are fine and dandy, but Genetics will fuck you in the ass if you ignore it.",0
1016,ok lets start    6 people can definitely repopulate the earth.    international space station = large gene pool  actually larger genepool the native populations of the world. aboriginals. native americans etc actually had a smaller genepool so surprise  senku would be more related to gen then to kohaku even if byaku was his blood father.    and also a small gene pool  and by extension inbreeding  wouldn't affect humans nearly as badly as other animals.    biggest issue is environmental changes screwing over the population as no indivuals have a trait to survive the environmental change well humans solved this issue   we are not built to handle cold at all but we made clothes  our ability to make stuff and build shelter fixes this issue.    now issues with inbreeding. surprisingly the show accidently  or on purpose  covered their bases really well. As long as the parents are not predisposed to genetic illnesses.birth defects are actually really unlikely. also the chances of genetic disorders appearing via inbreeding is way exaggerated assume u had a clone that was genetically identical to you but female  only the sex chromosome changed  say your have an avg predisposure to genetic disorders and you fucked said clone and had a child. your chances of having a totally normal baby is 999 1000 99.9% NANI YEP totally fine. this is a 20   increase in chance but its still 20   a really small chance. now breeding between siblengs increases the chance of a child suffering genetic disorders by 10   so 1999 2000 babies will be healthy.    wow right    then consider that astronauts are all genetically screened for any genetic illness that appears more then once in 100000 births. that base is pretty damn well covered.     ;    tldr genetics is a ok in this scenario,1
1017,"Do they address the small population size later in the show? I would think that after thousands of years, the population is either 0 or in the thousands.",2
1018,"Wait, but how could their graves be on the mainland if they were buried on the island? I seriously doubt their descendants bothered exhuming them.",2
1019,they are simbolic tombs,2
1020,probably this,2
1021,"Perfect example of a manga and anime experience being completely different, in a positive way. Reading this chapter I had no emotional reaction, watching the episode, I’m in tears. Loved this. Having lost my dad at 15 I always get emotional when it’s something about a parents love.",1
1022,Guys dont forget they are gonna prepare literally for a war next episode,2
1023,if senku wanted it would justbe a one sided slaughter via chemical weaponry not a war,2
1024,Not blood related even though his dad looks exactly like a older version of him right down to the eye color and the hair highlights lmao,1

1026,Nah man this was an editor note. Dr. Stone is definitely not written that way,2
1027,Same shampoo at barber,2
1028,weren't they all a team of smart astronauts and the best technological advancements they could make in 5000 years were huts and sticks?,2
1029,All of the smart people died on the island and their kids didint have a formal education on engineering.,2
1030,this is what happens when there are no engineers,2
1031,SWEET HOME ALABAMAAA,2
1032,"So this was a wonderful story and Senku's dad is amazing...    but why did they not try harder to go to a part of the world where civilization remained?  They were mostly scientists on the ISS.  Put them in a modern city with nobody there, and they could do a fuckload more than just maintain an island society.",1
1033,"That was orobably the plan, but everyone except Byakuya died within a few years",2
1034,"I'm still kinda confused on how this village works. In order for them to continue living and creating future generations, they had to have invited more people into their village, which seems very unlikely as, as far as is currently known, they are the only people to have survived the petrification. Meaning 3k years have passed with a very small genetic sample. I realize that this is an anime, but for a show that prides itself in being ""smart"", it really should follow basic genetic structure, because at this point, all the villagers should be at ""Hills have eyes"" mutant level.",2
1035,"Well, the Americas were only founded with a few dozen people of roughly similar genetic diversity, so four highly diverse parents is better than nothing.",2
1036,"And? Just because a few dozen people founded the first colonies doesn't mean more didn't show up, that's just dumb. Also just because there are a varied bunch of races from the space crew doesn't mean they have a better chance of escaping the negative effects of imbreading.",2
1037,"     No, I mean that  every  one of the millions of people that were living in the Americas in 1492 were descendants of like 70 people, all of whom had already been part of the same community for generations before they got here. So big trees can grow from small seeds.          It does though. I mean, it's not  perfect,  by any means, but take two examples, you have a small Japanese town, all life on Earth is wiped out except for four people in that Japanese town, and they have to repopulate. Well, chances are, even if those four are each from a completely different family, they probably have 1-2 grandparents, or at least great-great-great grandparents in common, and at bare minimum, traced back a dozen generations, they would have some common ancestors. The collection of potential genetic traits would be much more similar, and therefore the odds of hitting the same bad-luck combinations would be higher. If, on the other hand, you had four people from around the world, from genetic lines that hadn't met up in thousands of years, there would be a lot more variety in those genetics, each child would be rolling more dice, and be less likely to come up with matching bad genes. It wouldn't  prevent  inbreeding characteristics, but it would reduce the odds of it.",2
1038,y didnt you give the mroe scientific response    6 people can definitely repopulate the earth.    international space station = large gene pool  actually larger genepool the native populations of the world. aboriginals. native americans etc actually had a smaller genepool so surprise  senku would be more related to gen then to kohaku even if byaku was his blood father.    and also a small gene pool  and by extension inbreeding  wouldn't affect humans nearly as badly as other animals.    biggest issue is environmental changes screwing over the population as no indivuals have a trait to survive the environmental change well humans solved this issue   we are not built to handle cold at all but we made clothes  our ability to make stuff and build shelter fixes this issue.    now issues with inbreeding. surprisingly the show accidently  or on purpose  covered their bases really well.

1040,I hope they make a 12 episode season to conclude the stone wars,1
1041,Tsukasa is coming thinking this is a fighting game where as Senku is just gonna age of empires his shit.,1

1048,"Man, it's been a while since an anime have made me cry",1
1049,It’s weird how humanity didn’t manage to advance out of the Stone Age in the last 3700 years.,2
1050,The scientists didn't live to teach their children and people forget what they don't need. In addition to that not everyone finds science interesting. Our stone age lasted roughly 3.4 million years  according to Wikipedia . So 3700 years of stone age is believable.,2
1051,I have to assume either to early adult die off with only Storytelling mastered or the certain civil wars and coups causing a Dark Age occurred. Storytelling have a religious theme a good back up if Civil War or coup especially a religious driven uprising destroyed the culture and records I'm sure they tried to have. and Civil Wars and Coups a certainty many times over in thousands of years.     At the time of Ramses the III all of the European Civilizations died except Egypt and as far as we can tell reading and writing in most areas. Several Types of Natural Disasters hit and invasions of what the Egyptians called the Sea Peoples crippled Egypt for the rest of history even though it survived.   Egypt's survival and assumed pockets elsewhere managed over hundreds of years to restart civilization but it was a near thing.     Technology went far backwards in many ways during the Dark Ages. China had several problems that caused technology loss and backslides.       Intreating thing I have put together. I'm not a jew and a very liberal Christian so tend disbelieve divine causes if I can think of man caused ones.    The fall of the Cannite civilizations allowed a Jewish invasion and take over  arguments about they were just next door vs some or all from Egypt still going  Jerico's walls weakened by earthquake and then the Jews finding the Resonance point of Jerico's walls good explanation of them falling. Modern Architects try to avoid their buildings having a Resonance frequency that could occur in their environment. Tsunami caused extreme low tide a good explanation for parting the Red Sea at an inlet as well.   Why no record of Jews in Egypt? If it was a fairly small number of Surfs  the type of Slavery recorded  why would Egypt record that failure with Sea People being a major problem at the same time.,2
1052,"We only figured out agriculture  which is the basis of civilization  around 10,000 years ago and our species of hominid  aka, modern humanity  has existed for around 100k years.

1053,Where does it say they got to Japan while he was still alive?,2
1054,"No, she says ""these are the graves of our people, this is Byakuya's"" or something like that.    I mean, it is simple logic. They weren't in mainland Japan and they now are there. Wether you like it or not, it does not change that fact.",1
1055,she says this is the grave of our founders not this is the grave of the first 4     ;    chances are its the graves of the first people to make it to japan not byakus,2
1056,"Look, I'm telling you you are wrong. We get to see another Byakuya flashback later on and he  didn't  live to see the Japan.",0
1057,The actual gravestone for him was on a cliff overlooking the sea on an island. The one she showed him was on a mound inland from the sea on the mainland. They are not the same location.,2
1058,"Yeah the concept of farming and civilization hadn’t been invented by mankind 10,000 years ago. Yet Ishigami village is 3,7000 years old and established by survivors with prior knowledge. In that timeline, there should be thousands of humans alive with multiple villages, maybe even towns. Not 40 people living in straw huts.",2
1059,"Do you have any proof there are no other villages? Or that there weren't waaaay more people before they all died off for some reason  plague war, etc .      Also, ""established by survivors with prior knowledge"" except that    A  they all died off early on    B  Most of their knowledge was useless.      Also, their starting population was so stupidly low that it is more impressive thy are still around. Being prosperous would be even more crazy.",0
1060,"They would have had a LOT of birth defects and genetic diseases, so the viable population could have remained extremely small. Also, if they lacked basic agriculture,  and  had a society that discouraged a nomadic lifestyle, then their available food supply would not support a large civilization.

1061,without paper we cant advance shit,0
1062,And the language didn't evolve either...,2
1063,"That... that doesn't make any sense.     They should have prepare food, build a boat and go to the mainland. Why would they want just to stuck on the island when there's whole untouched civilization still intact not that far away?They would be able to preserve at least medieval technologies easily, and record rest of the knowledge for their kids.    good episode, if not for the shattering of suspense of disbelief",0
1064,There's an ocean inbetween all that juicy modern civ. They don't teach you to build cruise ships in astronaut school anymore.,2
1065,"So if they're that far away from civilization, why did Ishigami Village happen to be located within walking distance of where Senku woke up?",2
1066,Because the 1st story of the 100 stories talks about leaving the island for Japan.,2
1067,"But there's an ocean in between all that juicy modern civ. Did they wait until so much time had passed that all remnants of modern society had been reclaimed by nature, and THEN build those cruise ships and found Ishigami village within walking distance of where Senku woke up?",2
1068,I'd have to spoil you. There are no hard numbers on what happened when is all I'll say.,2
1069,The reason why it took them so long to migrate to Japan is a very very late spoiler.,2
1070,Theres also supposed to be a spinoff manga for Byakuya soon,2
1071,they didnt build cruise ships they slowly island hopped their way to japan,2
1072,No one is answering how Byakuya's grave and the Founder's Cemetery is right outside the village when they were originally buried on the remote island.,2
1073,"simbolic tombs, no corpses",2
1074,Unless it's a translation error Ruri says that spot is where they were buried.,2
1075,It's a translation error,2
1076,Obviously sometime between then and the 3k years that followed they  did  move away. But taht's more than enough time to develop the required naval technologies to make the trip doable.,2
1077,"So according to your timeline, the Ishigami residents 1  waited until after all of the scavengeable remnants of modern society had vanished 2  developed the naval technology needed to traverse from the island where the founders landed to mainland Japan 3  founded Ishigami village within walking distance of where Senku would wake up years later and then 4  did not technologically advance any further  regressed, in fact  or grow in population beyond a sleepy enclave of 40 people or so?",2
1078,"You assume they purposefully waited that long. There are hundreds of reaons why they could eventually emigrate from their original island. Famines, war, plagues. The list is quite long.    Then we don't know how many of them arrived to mainland Japan nor what happened after  there are  a lot  of signs that recently a lot of the villagers died  so their numbers aren't taht crazy. especially for a pre-agricultural society.    About them funding their vilalge close to where Senku was. Yeah, they were in the same 100km radius. It is ""convenient"" but that's also called ""plot"", if you don't like it then maybe this thing called ""fiction"" isn't for you.    Also, the technology required to reach the mainland is not  that  advanced. It's just that without resources to spare or the imperatives  after all the astronauts died there was no reason to leave the island  long-distance naval travel was not exactly a high priority for anyone.",2
1079,1. luck,1
1080,"Yakov and Darya tried to go for antibiotics and never returned, as stated in that scene it's too risky, if they failed it would be the end of humanity.",2
1081,"If going by the anime, they also used a dingy fishing boat instead of build something more substantial.",2
1082,Building something more substantial would be a massive undertaking that 6 people wouldn't have been able to do alone that garenteed their safety. You can't stock a small sail boat both enough food to last a month or more on the water.,2
1083,"Because they aren't shipwrights? Making a boat capable of travelling that distance reliably is kinda hard. Never mind that they would be risking the lives of the entire group for a possible gain and a high risk  I mean, for all they knew whatever froze everyone was still present in the cities, never mind that they may die while travelling there .     ;    Historically most primitive societies that tried to move long distance through water  without  the pre-required technologies mostly died, only a few got lucky and made it through by chance.     ;    I mean, could you  assuming you are a regualr person or a highly specialized professional of an unrelated craft  make a boat?",2

1085,"Why do people keep answering ""they are astronauts""? Being an astronaut has no bearing on them being capable of building a boat good enough to navigate undreds fo kilometres to the mainland  or Japan proepr, whatever is closer . It's like saying ""well, X is an electrical engineer, so they should know how to cultivate the fields"".    And how would you build it? I'm really interested now.",1
1086,"     Which makes perfect sense. You would expect people with higher education to know about these things - I certainly expect my peers to know about it.         Depends on what's available in that island. With certainty we can say lots of trees - that's pretty good. First order of business is identifying their buoyancy and permeability, as well as do a series of tests on their sap. Second thing is identifying the near coast, which species live there and from which we can extract materials. Preserving clothes could also be important in the case no material is found for sails. Strings, ropes and such are also of immense importance when it comes to boats, save every single one you can find. Last but not least, plastic - you can find plastic waste pretty much anywhere in the planet, even the most remote islands. It can be used as buoys, containers and pretty much anything you could think of.",2
1087,"        No, it is the exact opposite. The more educated in one field yoou are the more narrow your expertise becomes. For example, a modern chemist knows a lot fo things, but they all depend on working inside a highly interconnected society that provides hundreds of small  and not so small  services that make them able to do their jobes, from the people in charge of growing their food to the ones that make the tools they use. Human society is stupidly specialized and most people don't know almost anything  as far as total human knowledge goes .         Ok, you basically said ""I would look for materials"" so let's assume you found all of them  enought rope, something for the sails, good enough wood, etc  how would you go about actually  building  and  using  the boat? Do you have some kind of design in mind? Do you know the currents in the area? How much manpower hours can you dedicate to building the boat vs securing food?",2
1088,"       It's not simply a question of finding the  types  of materials, we also need to know  which  materials. If the only tree I could use for a boat is bamboo, then a reed boat is the best we can do. Design would depend on the various characteristics of the material acquired and the amount too. If you have infinite materials, trial and error becomes a great solution. With limited sources, not so much.    They had access to a large metal capsule, that would be perfect for making some crude tools. I would also expect them to have some modern tools in it.    Closed, empty multi hull designs are particularly attractive by their simplicity and robustness. Round boats are difficult to make with hard wood, so we should rule them out. Beyond that, we can think about hybrid designs like a large raft below a smaller boat. Designs are certainly not the limiting factor here.    Do we know where exactly did they land? Depending on whether it was more South or North, we should use different strategies. Pacific currents are essentially a clockwise spiral above the Equator and counter clockwise circle below.         That depends on what can be settled between everyone. If nobody has specific knowledge on essential tasks, a simple rotation system can be put in place so that each person focuses on a few tasks every day. If there are animals in the island, traps can do a good chunk of the work.",2
1089,"I could manage building a raft with pontoons. Canoe with the same pontoons and I just went to summer camp for several years. Your making it too hard assuming this a island not that far from japan that they attempted to reach in a row boat. They had humans living there as well with some modern things to build stuff out of as well. Their initial food supply was canned goods.   If they had not tried to reach Japan with the row boat you might have a better point. Not saying for sure they live always chance of storm coming in but it's a good chance.     Assume a fall of civilization in the almost certain civil wars and coups the group would have had, a very large number over this much time. Thus the stories make a great plan B. Research has shown storytelling can pass things down thousands of years with little error when complete memorization it the tradition followed.  When written records replace storytelling then stories becoming only entertainment telling of tales causes great variations is what Western Civilization is used to and thus assumed of all cultures.",2
1090,because they're side characters Steve. They don't have screen time to do all that.,1
1091,"There are honestly so many things wrong with the backstory that it's better to just completely switch off all critical thinking when considering its' plausibility and evaluating it solely as a character story. Like, I'm talking Usagi Drop manga levels of ""I'm gonna pretend that didn't happen.""",0
1092,totally possible to explain everything as realistic,1
1093,"Because the first pod went awry,  and the rest needed to land on the island to save the guys in the first pod. When there's only 6 people left, it's the wise decision.    After that, i suppose they could had spent all their efforts return to the mainland, build a big boat and all should be achievable, but pneumonia and shit happened pretty quick, as the characters didn't really age that much. So I interpreted it as they didn't have enough time before only Teacher and Singer was left, and they did all they could. We also don't know how long they survived after.         It's not really realistic, but this show has never really been completely believable anyway.",2
1094,"yea it was all bullshit bad story writing. Their first goal should have been to cross the ocean to a mainland no matter what. They obviously should have had a map or a plan B to figure out ""what do we do after we save the guys in the escape pod"".    It's also bullshit people keep defending ""Well they can't build a ship because they aren't shipwrights"". They could have simply built a larger version of the small fishing boat. Or could have made a raft.    Hell there is even a story of a scientist who made a small fishing boat and used it to cross the ocean.    Ugh it annoys me how everyone defends shitty storytelling.",0
1095,"They didn't even teach their children to read.  They were living in grass huts within 2 years while there were still functional cars, diesel generators, and solar panels a few miles away.",2
1096,Across a fucking ocean,2
1097,"Hey science people! Can someone tell me why the ISS got destroyed so soon after they left it? If it was in orbit, I guess there must be some maintenance they do up there that keeps it going regardless?",2
1098,"There's trace atmosphere at that altitude is, so it gradually slows down as it collides with it. We have to use fuel to speed the station up so that it maintains orbit. I don't know if that's an automatic system or not, but even if it is, eventually it runs out of fuel, gradually slows down and eventually burns in re-entry.",2
1099,"Reboosting is handled from the ground. With no one on the ground to operate it, it'd fall out of orbit probably within months to a year",2
1100,"Dope, thanks for the explanation!",1
1101,But personally I really think it would last for longer than 3 years before completely losing orbit. Even without the boosts I don't think it would decay at that speed.,1
1102,"You don't even need to think, the average ISS decay rate is around 2 km  1.24 miles  per month according to various sources, which represents something close to 5% decay per year. Should be noted that it varies a lot, depending on factors such as atmospheric composition, solar activity etc.",2
1103,"also the more the ISS slows down, it will descend further into in atmosphere and that will slow it down further",2
1104,"I don't think it would even last a year, especially without the ground crew in mission control to change the solar panel orientation  if they face the wrong way, it adds more drag which means it'd fall back sooner . A lot of things at that orbit altitude don't last more than a couple years, but the giant panels decrease it's lifetime even more",2
1105,it would last about 5 years  i can post math if u want,1
1106,The space craft carrying the crews up is used as a booster rocket once attached to the station so they are constantly increasing altitude with each crew change.,2
1107,no maintenance for 1 year means a lot,2
1108,Senku's voice breaking when he's talking to Byakuya... damn.    Couldn't they have lip-synced Lilian for when she was signing at least? It's a shame they half-ass the animation when so much effort is poured into all other elements of the show.,0
1109,"This might be controversial but I was expecting Senku `s dad to be better- he kinda just told some tales, had babies and died. Then resting the whole of humanity on Senku `s shoulders. Like... it hardly shows any attempts of trying to find the source or create something amazing. Maybe thats the point to show he was average or maybe theres more in the manga but that `s not exactly parenting 101",0
1110,"There's more in the manga, hell, he recently got his own spin-off.",1
1111,You hear that guys? NOT blood-related.    You may proceed to ship make doujin of whomever from the village with Senku without any guilt.,1
1112,Well they are much less related then the other people in the village are to each other.,1
1113,"Even IF Senku was blood related to his dad, it wouldn't mater. At 3,700 years of time distance all related traces have gone away. Senku would not be related to Kohaku. Even in our life, it's very probable that you and a random person from the place of your birth share a common ancestor, and it wouldn't be incest I you hoocked up. Senku would probably be more closely related to Gen than to any one in the tribe.    But that's the scientific aspect of it, not being related by blood keeps the moral aspect in tack and keeps people from yelling incest at the screen   even though scientifically it's not  ",2
1114,This is a REALLY good anime.,1
1115,"Damn this was sad, especially Shamil's speech. It also sucks that they died relatively young. :'     One thing that seems strange to me is that they have not made clear the Byakuya x Lillian ship, I mean, Kohaku and Ruri obviously have to descend from her but it is weird that they have only shown those 4 children.",0
1116,They did. There was 1 lilian looking girl when the montage about the ancestors started,1
1117,"Oh yeah, I saw her. But the fact that she didn't appear in the flashbacks felt weird to me, even in Lillian's death.",1
1118,"So... Senku is not blood-related to Byakuya  despite the fact that they look pretty much the same, with the exception of the hairstyle .    I'm not a betting man, but I bet that the author did this to escape the thing about him being technically blood related to the potential romantic interests  even though they would be so far removed, that he would most likely the least closely related to them human on the planet, pillarmen excluded .    So... If she's not blood related, she's ok to be dated.",1
1119,the author intented them to be blood related but an editor at Shonen Jump made him change it,2

1129,I assume that the stories was actually the backup Plan. I assume the main Plan was we will establish a modern culture and teach our kids lots of knowledge and encourage further knowledge advancement. They probably picked town hall everyone votes government with instructions on representative Government following. They probably tried to form a library and have that passed down.     There is no way they started a male only best fighter picked as chief system that occurred before the old chief died of old age.     But smartly they realized that historically the chance of a coup or religious coup occurring and destroying the civilization rebuild culture and the written records they tried to preserve was a possibility. So the Stories were the backup plan made part of a religious like practice more likely to survive a Dark Age.   Of course the Grownups could have died to young and only the Story part well started before the occurrence.     And I will fan wank having a turned to stone son somehow coming back to life was at least at first only a dream backup plan to the backup plan. As there was no way to know if the Stone state could ever be reversed.     At least they came up with a good reason for Japan.,1
1130,the chief system forces you to marry the GIRL so that way the tradition is kept alive,2
1131,"So I'm dumb.... They landed on an ""Island"" since they're talking about ""go to the mainland"". But then the village is just part of mainland Japan. So why did they set sail for ""mainland"" to find antibiotics?",2
1132,Ishigami village is a small island on the coast of Japan. The astronaut’s island is an island several hundred kms away. They are two different locations.,2
1133,Sooo... Those kids figured out how to cross the water eventually I guess?,2
1134,"Over several thousand years through probably many MANY deaths, yes.",1

1138," Dad gave Senku the gift of Friendship...          comfortfood       TWITTER SONAR! HAHAHAHHA!      It started in Brazil?      Oh shit, he KO'd dad and went down himself... thats rough.  Diva, Braids, and Mr Personality went down.      And they missed and are trapped in the water... shit.      Byaku came to save them himself!  What a hero!      SO there was 1 statue on the island, damn...      I guess they gotta live on the island now...      3 YEARS LATER!?  KIDS!? MARRIAGE!?      Damn and we get an emotional song by the Diva... she had a rough life it seems.      Dad still beleive sin Senku.  WAIT NOT BLOOD RELATED!?  DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT!?      Damn so dad's whole plan was to make allies for Senku when he wakes up.      Yep he said it they wernt related.  So whats the story behind that i wonder.      Seems all the villagers are havin a party so i guess its all workng out.      Dad left a message for Senku?      Braids is sick?  Fuck... braids died...  Pneumonia...      Damn... mr personality died too... fuck...      So the Hundred Tales were made by Dad to help the decendants survive.      NO NOT DIVA TOO!?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!      Oh shit, hey have a massive grave with alkl the descenants...      Damn... Dad died too...      Dad sure had a lot of faith in Senku...  man he was one hell of a father.      So the gift of science was friendship.  Man thats great.      And Tarzan is on the way, oh shit.  Now that Senku knows the village is his family he def cant let them fall.",1
1139,"For those wondering about the two that left and never came back   its not confirmed yet but there are other settlements in the manga. Not to mention, its highly likely senku wasnt the only blessed by natural depetrification. What differs is that he is a genius who holds all the science info.  ",2
1140,"So... if the parents died on that islands, and senku was in japan, how did his body travel to that island? or am i missing some thing",2
1141,"the village is in the main island, the tombs were moved",2
1142,"Or not, It's highly possible  actually most likely  that the ""graves"" are actually just monuments or symbolic. Can you really imagine a bunch of kids building a raft to travel 100's of kilometers across the ocean and digging up old graves and transporting decomposing bodies with them?",2
1143," By far my favorite 2 episodes of the series so far, had me crying during those flashbacks.",1

1155,They did,1
1156,"It only just occurred to me that, being standing inside the building at the time,  ""Senku should have fallen over, been crushed underneath two stories of collapsed school building, and even if eventually washed away from that, it would have been in dozens of pieces. They really should have established that either A. Petrified people are indestructible, or B. Senku was outside at the time, but instead they made it clear that petrified people are relatively fragile."" ",2

1160,What a good episode,1
1161,"in short, THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE made me a grown ass man cry dawggg",0
1162,"How do they pass them off as ""not related by blood""? There THAT many people with cabbage stalk white to greenish grey hair AND red eyes in this world?     Actually, what was the story with his dad anyway? I'm sure they had him as a generic that took out loans and sold stuff to buy his science gear but then they retconned it to space-brother and then altered that to ""legally only even though we look identical""? Did Senku have the most fucked up childhood they're going to insert at some point?",2
1163,"I'm kinda disappointed by how impossible the origins of the village are. I don't usually nitpick stuff like that, especially in anime, but with the amount of reverence Doctor Stone has shown for science I was hoping for something at least remotely plausible.  Doesn't spoil the show though.",0
1164,Care to explain why it’s impossible?,2
1165,What’s so impossible about it?,2
1166,"That with the insane amount of inbreeding going on they didn't become sterile.   That despite being the children of Astronauts they still turned primitive  none of those stories taught them how to smelt metal? .  That their small village is all there is both structurally and population wise.  That the language didn't drift seemingly at all, I get it's a small population but still,  3,700 years is a heck of a long time.    I'm just a big language and history nerd so it probably bothers me more than most. Still love the show.",0
1167,I just wish they thought of a solution to the severe lack of genetic diversity if you start with only 6 people. Besides that at some point he should be able to make something like paper? Or anything that doesn't rely on teaching stories to children over thousands of years. Not to mention that after like 10 years you would think they would be able to make a boat good enough to reach civilization. Sure there aren't any humans but looting supermarkets would be enough food for like 100 years.,2
1168,Same idea had by myself. Storytelling had to be the backup plan B.  First if all adults died before full literacy in next generation achieved. Second if for certain coups and civil wars over that amount of time plunged things into a Dark age the Stories might survive the burning of the libraries and stuff like that.,1
1169,last guy alive was the dumbest one,1

1171,bruh its her same voice,2
1172,"Well that's any ability I have to suspend disbelief exhausted. How did one capsule manage to aim at a continent and miss, yet the other manage to land on a small island? Why did Byakuya despite apparently being massively devoted to saving his son not make a serious attempt at making it to the main land, which is apparently a distance that can be rowed inside a couple of days? How did Byakuya and the other astronauts not manage to leave their descendants even basic technology or science?",2
1173,"1  Look into the landing difficulties of a Soyuz capsule. You either are extremely lucky and hit perfectly or you miss by several hundreds or even thousands of kilometers.    2  The main land is VERY far away, there is a very high risk of death with a primitive boat over that distance, they simply couldn’t risk it. The soyuz capsule, which took Byakuya 10 hours of rowing to reach is still like 5% of the total distance to Japan.    3  Because 5 6 people died in a matter of years and Byakuya is not a scientific genious like Senku, not to mention that he had almost no materials on a secluded island. The only scientific knowledge he had was completely passed down in the Hundred tales.",2
1174,"1  That's totally not how landing spacecraft or probability work. It isn't some binary situation where it is either good or terrible.    2  If the land is very far away, why did they send that pair to row to land? They would have to complete the round trip inside at most a week in order to be able to bring back antibiotics in time. Ergo, they must be within a few days of land, or they set off on that trip knowing it to be pointless and suicidal.    3  He is a science teacher astronaut, and he has access to tonnes of materials from the capsule. The remnants didn't even know how to do metal working, despite having ready access to a literal tonne of metal from the capsule. They didn't have electricity, despite having batteries, wires and generators. That is beyond ridiculous.",2
1175,I'm lost with the locations. So Byakuya team wanted to land on South America but they missed it and ended up on an island at the middle of the sea. Then how the cemetry and the whole village ended up at the coast of Japan?,2
1176,They were avoiding South America.,2
1177,"South America is where the petrification came from. Assuming petrification works like radiation they aimed for Japan and missed. Byakuyas team landed on nearby deserted island to go save them. Now they are stuck on that lone island. The message in the stories is ""head to Japan"" which offspring eventually did since Ishigami village exists.",2
1178,"Okay.... I'm sorry, I found that unsatisfying. Maybe it's because the entire time, I'm thinking ""6 people is not enough. Inbreeding issues are going to happen"". Plus it's still kinda vague how they got from that random island to Japan. No, it didn't kill my investment, but honestly, I wonder if I would've been more satisfied if where they came from remained more of a mystery and not important to the story. Because even now, I'm not sure knowing all of that actually contributed to the narrative. It does have a theme that's brought up that I can see being used, but I don't know if we needed to have a big dramatic backstory to get there, and having so much placed on ""Senku, boy of destiny"" undermines a bit of the story to me.",0
1179,"I felt the same way, if they had removed the whole part about getting trapped on an island it would have made more sense to the story continuity. maybe just a scene were you see an old version of his dad who had failed to unpetrify people but instead settled down outside of japan dragging senku to the caves and then creating the village.  Apparently they are making a spin off manga about senku's dad so that might be why it seemed out of place.",0
1180,"I was really hoping for a better story with Byakuya, like researching what happened situation; going to South America, journeying back to Japan, and making the village at the end of their lives.

1186,Wait so all the descendants are the son and daughter from the russian couple and the two kids from Connie-Shamil.    Did Byakuya and the singer could not have kids then? Because after they died there were only 4 kids  the ones mentioned before .,2
1187,"The only explanation that I can think of is that they didn't show us all the kids. To be fair I would expect each couple to have like 10 kids, they literally have nothing else to do than to survive and fuck. If they really only produced 4 children, that would mean that from 6 people the unstoned human population went from 6 to 4 in one generation, losing 33% of the human population. No wonder the village isn't huge after 3 thousand years",2
1188,I would also like to complain about how Byakuya didnt tell the kids  aside from the 100 tales  to find books and knowledge in Japan...    It would make sense if they were way too young and the state of their parents didnt allowed them to become literate  since apparently all the adults aside from the russian couple were completely wiped out by pneumonia . Also soap made from animal fat is simple to make and it would been a great addittion to the 100 tales.,0
1189,"     I'd imagine with humans not around a lot of books would end up unreadable pretty quickly due to no longer being in a controlled environment. Windows get smashed letting in the elements, condensation smears ink, animals salvaging the paper for nests or toys, etc.",2
1190,Yes but remember Byakuya saw the petrification and went down as fast as he could.    Going by the age of the children there might have been 12 or 13 years since the petrification and im pretty sure libraries  especially the closed ones or cabinets  could have a ton of readable content,1
1191,Possible location of Astronaut Island according to the official translator Hachijo-Kojima     ,2
1192,"I still don't get how they even managed to get to Japan in the first place, they were on some random island in the middle of nowhere, it would make sense if Byakuya was the one who lead the first generation there but he died and the kids were barely 10 years old. I'm surprised they even survived to be honest.",0
1193,Well they were born with the world in that state.   I would think that aside from playing and sleeping they would all been learning to survive while their parents were alive.    They might have traveled after they got older and more experienced.,2

Don't' trust Wikipedia occasionally the lie version posted or some modern sources are attempting to lie on this subject throwing under the bus all the people who worked in past few centuries to raise the marriage age from 12 once life expectancy allowed it.   Read about Black Plague with live expectancy in mid 20's and mortality rates of children at 75 percent or so you don't keep humans in existence except by breeding as early as possible and as often as possible.

1210,"I guess this is asked a lot, but what was to stop Byakuya and the rest just going and getting essentials like medicinal supplies? They landed literally a few days after the petrification, it wasn't like everything had decayed yet. And on that note why didn't they just breed rapidly, take over a former city and slowly expand with at least a foothold of modern technology  despite obviously lacking expertise .",2
1211,They wre in the middle of the ocean with only a row boat for transportation. None of them knew much about navigation either.    Do the math.,2
1212,"     That didn't stop previous civilizations. Particularly, they're in an island with lots of trees, making a large boat shouldn't be too difficult in 3 years.         They're astronauts, that's absolutely false.",2
1213,"     Yes, so? for most of human history boats didn't leave sight of the land. Those that went on deep sea travels usually didn't make it. It is a high risk-low reward operation. Also, make a boat with what tools? And waht ""boat""? More like a crude raft  which is shit for such a long travel .     ;         They have survival training, but I don't remember them being trained navigators or carpenters who know how to build, maintain and operate boats.",2
1214,Not the middle of the ocean they did try to make the trip in row boat results clearly boat lost but unknown on the people. So they knew they were close enough to make a row boat trip doable. They did have a exact idea of where they were and were Japan was.     It not that they could not make the trip they just did not want to risk it. Rafts and canoes with pontoons not too hard to figure out if you spend a few years at it. But why try to move when you can survive there and only when population higher they can risk the trip.,2
1215,"D-did you miss the part in the episode where the doctor couple left for the mainland and never returned, presumably dying at sea?",2
1216,Did you miss the part about their decedents making it to the mainland? If their children could do it with little or no education why couldn't the parents figure it out?,2
1217,"1. Because they had a society that grew around fishing so they developed much more advanced sailing knowledge than their astronaut ancestors    2. Luck is a factor    3. At the time the descendants made the voyage, there were enough of them that it was worth the risk of a few leaving and potentially dying. With 6 people who have children to worry about being the only humans left alive, why would you throw everyone at the ocean? There’s a good chance that they’d die and humanity would die out right there. That’s why they didn’t attempt it until they were at risk of dying from disease, and even then it was only 2 of them that went when there were 3 others that were still healthy on the island. They played the safest hand.",1
1218,"     Because without modern medicine, human pregnancy is dangerous as fuck. That's essentially asking the women to die.",0
1219,Have to assume they did breed rapidly you don't survive without producing a large number of kids. And yes a large number of women die but that' is the way you do it. And you start as soon as possible once numbers are high enough to gain in that math of more early mom deaths vs extra babies born. All mammals I'm aware of have higher risk of death on first pregnancy because waiting till safety is maximum not the way to get greatest number of babies. Mother Nature cares nothing for the individual.,1
1220,How many episodes will there end up being in the season?,2
1221,24 or 25 iirc.,2
1222,"If there are, it’ll probably be 24. But thank you.",1
1223,"I'm in a critical need for a hug, this episode drained me emotionally..",0
1224,Emotional sobbing  Best Dad ever ,1
1225,Didn’t think this was gonna make me emotional but I’m like cryin rn,0
1226,Where do I go to rate the episode on a scale of 10???,1
1227,what a good solid series. this episode made me cry but everything the blond girl started singing i cringed so hard,1
1228,This episodes makes me want to read the manga even more,1
1229,literally just spent the episode crying at how much of a beautiful relationship the author weaved between senku and old man. : ,1
1230,Wenku!!!,2
1231,Damn it! I have an exam in like 5 minutes and am about to cry from this episode!,1
1232,This episode was a real tear jerker,1
1233,Damn... Byakuya and Senku are such beasts,1
1234,Does anyone know who did the English singing?,2
1235,Dammit it was the Pillar Men all along! They turned everyone to stone!,2
1236,Got em with the old 'but its not like we're related ' lol.,1
1237,So Senku is basically the Messiah to the villagers,2
1238,Am I dumb or what was the science gift senku was talking about,2
1239,"Wait... did this shit started in Brazil? kkk Of course, that was the only option kk' HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE  o ",2
1240,"Kind of nit picky but wouldn't a population established by only 6 people be horrifically inbred after a couple generations? Also come to think about it, why does the village even speak japanese? Even if that was the original language of the survivors, the fact that the language has undergone zero change over thousands of years makes no sense.",0
1241,"Im glad Byakuya and Lillian got together as well as I shipped them hard but throughout the episode I didnt think they did tbh. Am I the only that thought they left that a little vague? They felt more like close friends and not once did it come across that they were together, I actually had to look at this thread and see people say they got together to even think they did. Are we sure they did? Did they have any children either?",1
1242,"Near the end of the flashback, right before we see Byakuya’s grave, there’s children running and playing. One of the kids looks like Lillian, so i assume they had kid s . It also isn’t known how many kids there were exactly. Yakov and Darya had 2 kids for sure, Connie and Shamil had 2 kids appear on screen and then at the end there was one who looked like Lillian appear on screen.",2
1243,Kohaku blushing as if her entired civilization wasn’t already based around a lot of incest.,2
1244,"you gotta feel sorry for senku here...its obvious when he declared he'll revive all humans, he was thinking of his father as well, but now he knows that he is long gone and will never meet him again",0
1245,"Considering how the village started and with how much we humans screw like rabbits and breed like roaches, shouldn't the village be many times bigger than it is? Especially if you take the thousands of years into account with no contraceptives?",2
1246,"Very minor spoiler, but no agriculture, limited resources and famine doesn’t really allow a village separated from their original island to reach a size larger than a few dozen people.",2
1247,Did only a small group of the original descendants leave for Japan? Does that mean that there's a bigger village in South America on the original island?,2
1248,"The original island was on the seas near Japan as well, but yes, the people in Ishigami village are travelers. As for the original island, who knows?...",2
1249,"japan is a bitch place to start a civilization, super heat, death cold, lots of bugs, 0 domesticated animals, 0 cows, 0 horses, 0 sheeps  sheeps cant live without humans , only dogs are available",2
1250,I’m suprised Lilian died as well.    Also 4 kids were literally left to repopulate. Wow.,1
1251,Whattttt senku isn't blood related whattt. They look the same lmaoo,1
1252,His Dad Pulled Through,2
1253,what if the whole show is just how byakuya delusionally thinks his stepson who's really into science will somehow save the world and that's not what happened at all,2
1254,Does that mean  I'm the Imouto? ,2
1255,I was hoping it would be more like foraging supermarkets in a city of stone people,2
1256,"They’re not blood related? Was sure that they were. Either way, his love for his son is great.    Also, wasn’t expecting to cry  last episode was pretty sad  this episode. I feel personally attacked.",1
1257,"Honestly one of the few shows that's getting better as it goes on. First few episodes were great, then a long lull. Tournament lasted a full episode too long but these last two episodes were fantastic",1
1258,Probably my favorite episode of the season. Don’t know how I got so attached to those characters after just a couple episodes. Great finale to this arc,1
1259,  Bb,2
1260,Sad,0
1261,Anyone gonna mention that Magma is still surprisingly in the village?,2
1262,No reasonn to kick him out,0
1263,He probably will betray the village and join Tsukasa's side.,2
1264,Why? All he did was threaten to kill the chief's ex-wife.,2
1265,Made a grown man cry,1
1266,Episode was a perfect 5 7,1
1267,Even thought its a thousand years later Senkuu dad is still helping his son. That moment of Senkuu at his fathers grave was quite nice. Can't wait to see Senkuu deal with Tsukasa and his army.,1
1268,"So, I gotta ask: why didn't Senku's dad just go down the same path Senku did, and try to find a cure for the petrification? They had 6 of the worlds top scientists  who had all passed astronaut physical training tests, which are very rigorous  and all of the leftover tech of the current era! It seems crazy that they didn't just pursue a lab of their own...    Also, it's not like they were super rushed to get to the surface, so why didn't they just plan a landing site somewhere closer to a large tract of land?",2
1269,"Fun ?  Fact: I looked into it because of this Manga, but the minimum number of people needed for a sustainable colony with 0 incest, and still allowing some people to match based on preference is about 50.    Needless to say, 6 is far too few. Thankfully ? , incest is not guaranteed to cause massive genetic disorders, although it severely increases the odds.  As I understand it, most genetic glitches are recessive. They only become dominant if you pair with someone who has the same glitch, which is far more likely in a family member than outside  so while the village was almost certainly founded by Incest it's entirely possible that they simply kept  rolling the dice  to reach viable population levels. Thanks ?  to the suddenly limited science most of the unviable children wouldn't have survived anyways, and so those genetic mutations may have weeded themselves out by the time we arrive at Senku's generation.",2
1270,"Haven’t seen anyone mention it yet, but isn’t it crazy how it’s implied that their descendants made it to Japan from South America? Like sure it’s over 3000 years but how doe?",2
1271,LEGALIZE SISTERS,1
1272,I love this show so much and it might be the first show in a long time to make me pick the manga after the season is over.    I have so many questions especially about how little advancement took place in almost 4 thousand years. Some of their descendants must have made it to the mainland and found useful tools and technology.    Also for the Hundred Tales and how the first one is about living exclusively in Japan might have hurt them for generations because there are little resources in Japan.    Anyway this show answered so many of my questions and brought up some i didn't think about. I love it.,1
1273,That was such a tearjerker episode. Senku's dad really is amazing.,1
1274,great episode! it's been awesome learning about how the space crew lived. lots of emotional moments,1
1275,"It was a very well made adaptation. Quite different from the original material, I felt like I was seeing the story for the first time.",1
1276,IM NOT CRYING YOU’RE CRYING,1
1277,It makes it even more apparent that Seiku is the Main Character and I’m not mad about that!,1
1278,"Feels like there's so many plot wholes in this arch. So they determined that the disaster started in South America so they decided to land in Japan. 0.o An island of all places. I get they're aiming for the furthest spot from the disasters starting point but China is just as far from South America.  They're all smart people, they probably know that if they land in the middle of the ocean they're dead. You'd want to avoid that at all cost, being the last humans alive an all. So why not land in China or main land Asia where there is plenty of technology still working and not a risk of ending up in the middle of the ocean?    Another problem is even assuming they all had 2 kids we only get 6 kids. By their 3rd generation every on is screwing their half sister? I mean I guess it explains their eyes lol but still unless they added a chimp somewhere along the line the population couldn't survive 3500 years.    They're all super smart doctor, teacher, astronauts. And not one of them thinks they can build a boat together strong enough to sail 100km of ocean. Which on the other side of that ocean is their best bet for survival with medicine and laboratory equipment. Sure they dont teach you to how to build a boat as an astronaut but the physics of it arnt ridiculously hard. Trial an error till it floats. Leave on a good day in a good season.    This could've been written better, disappointed. On the other hand if you completely ignore a lot of plot holes it's a good story.",0
1279,"Ok now that the anime only folks are up to it, I can talk about the biggest problem I have with the series. For a show that takes such pains to make the science accurate, up to having an adviser for it, this story beat with the small group of scientists repopulating a somewhat large society who don't view each other as family is crazy.     At the end its two adults and four kids  two pairs of siblings  so if they start having descendants inbreeding is going to occur pretty quick, assuming people raised from birth so close to one another would even think about having sex.    A bit of a petty point I know, but just with this show it feels like such a plot issue.",0
1280,Didn't it show Byakuya dying there too fairly early  4 graves  basically leaving a group of kids that looked like 8-10 at most  they were running around playing .    Also didn't they try and land close to the beams source  South America .     How the fuck did their colony end up near Senku in Japan?,2
1281,"byakuya lived A LOT longer than the rest of his crew. Also, they wound up landing closer to Japan.",2
1282,"Thats what I thought, obviously otherwise it wouldn't make sense.    Just thought the scenes with 4 graves and kids were misleading and some of the crunchy subs are off I guess.",2
1283,"So 3600 years of incest.  And the fact the population is low they probably toss their defects off a cliff, sparta style.",2
1284,Incest = Wincest,2
1285,I think this is the best episode so far.,1
1286,Holy shit senku's dad is ripped,1
1287,"Ngl, the scene where Senku started to tear up, I choke up a little. Also I like how to pneumonia and ramen came full circle after so many generations!",0
1288,"Ah, there it is, the ""we're not blood related"" argument! Kohaku can now commence getting it on with her ancestor.     Well, 6 people building a village with their offspring seemed far fetched, but it seems even MORE far fetched seeing how out of the 6, 4 died without leaving many offsprings. That village is inbred af.",2
1289,If they all died on the island how did anyone ever make it to the mainland? Did the kids from future generations somehow leave and make it to the main land?,2
1290,"Yes, that was the point of the first story.",1
1291,Bruh is the village the results of 3700 years of incest is wincest?How even,2
1292,"As dads go Byakuya is 1 in 10,000,000,000,000.",1
1293,"Legit, I cried.",0
1294,Byakuya is so awesome. One of the best episode of this series.,1
1295,"I’m sorry, but I didn’t get which option they took.     They guesstimated the Ground Zero to be in South America. One option was to go there to find evidence. The other option was to go the furthest away  like the Japan area  to stay safe and or find survivors. Which one did they do?",0
1296,Japan and missed horribly. They had to settle for a lone island nearby. They had nothing to gather from but the little food that hermit had.,0
1297,"I'm ready for the Senku, Taiju and Yuzuriha reunion!",1
1298,"The Adam Eve set up was pretty jarring, but not impossible, and we can write off statistical improbabilities since this is a story, but it was four thousand years and they had to have a moderate amount of technological inheritance, because they don't send idiots into space  yet . How come there is only forty people? Either this is not the only settlement, or I don't know. Forty people is pretty negligable amount in the large scale of things, and any global enough disaster can wipe them all out without a problem. Illness, climate shit, predators, either there should be more of them, or they should be dead. Four thousand years is not a timeline where nothing stupidly dangerous can't happens. Volcano eruptions, meteors, shit, nuclear stations and bombs can explode accidentially.",1
1299,Think how long the stone age lasted,2
1300,"That's make no sense.How population with only 4 people can survive more than 2-3 generations? After one or two generations everyone will have genetics diseases and they will propably die.    And why they doesn't come back to the urban area? They would have everything there to recreate civilisation.  Labs, antibiotics etc. ",2
1301,Have you even watched the episode? 1.5x speed doesn't count.,2
1302,"I love this show but man, every single thing that happens in it is like 10 billion percent unlikely. Even the part where Senku's dad rescued the astronauts in the pod by rowing out to them had me like ""nope, he would've had to search a huge patch of ocean, they would've died for fucking sure.""     But whatever. This show is a great time regardless and I like it a lot. It doesn't get caught up on nitpicks like that. Nothing depresses me more than seeing the deaths of generations long past, though.",0
1303,I don't see why Byakuya couldn't have a portable GPS with him. They knew their location.,2
1304,"the real science was the friends we made along the way    also, you gotta love anime for the    ""Man, I sure do love my...      takes out ladder      climbs up to the top      pulls out megaphone      NOT BLOOD RELATED     father who died 3000 years ago""",2
1305,also magma and his goons should of been exhiled long ago or at least disqualified,2
1306,"I mean, they didn't do anything illegal.",2
1307,That moment when I was reading Ingoshima before watching this episode : ,2
1308,I had never cried due to an anime before this episode. Cried twice.,0
1309,"This episode was so beautifully done before I realized it I was crying and literally couldn't stop. What a great father, what a great man.",1
1310,Beautiful episode.    So there's no incest if they're not blood related!,1
1311,Tears were shed.,1
1312,"Astronauts are all highly intelligent, why did they get stuck at fire hut level for the rest of their lives? 3700 years and we only have 40-50 people in a village? How did 6 people have enough genetic variation to survive? Did they go inbred for a long time? Couldn't they have repopulated the planet and developed technology even greater than year 2019 in that amount of time? Samoans had the same level of technology and utilities and populated the entire pacific at the very least. Why didn't he teach his children science instead of a fairytale, at the very least why not both? How did he know the story wouldn't change after thousands of years without written word? How did the island drift to Japan, were those were fake gravestones? I dont think islands or continental drift works like that on a relatively short timescale, if anything it should have sunk.",1
1313,Don't worry kohaku. Even if you and senku are related incest is wincest ,2
1314,I'M NOT CRYING. SHUTR UP,1
1315,That was an awesome song that Lillian sang for the wedding. Will there ever be a full version of it? I've only been able to find one video that goes up to before she runs to the cliffside.,2
1316,"Man this anime had me with some pretty good science up to this point, but then just had to get real dubious on how six people repopulated the earth to create a village of over 40 people  plus all the outsiders that they must be guarding from since they have guards to fight them .     I guess it’s a good thing that the petrification process rejuvenated those it affects, otherwise the village with their small gene pool and I’m assuming different immune system would be in for a hell of a ride once their totally not related friend, Senku, revived the rest of the world. Or when any of the de-petrified interact with them, for that matter. Think pneumonia that lasted most of a young adult woman’s life is bad? Better hope Senku or Tsukasa don’t revive an anti-vax kid whose got measles.     Also why didn’t they ever try to go to a city, where they could have access to real scientific equipment and could study the petrification phenomenon like Senku, but from the other angle of time? They even said there had been a farm nearby early in the flashback, right? Why didn’t they go there to live? There must have also been a place for the farm staff to work, plus farm equipment to further work the land. Why didn’t they try to make it to an area that was closer to medical equipment to help fight future illnesses?     I’m excited to keep watching to see how this all unfolds further, but I have so many questions.",1
1317,This is late but how has it been 3700 years and the village still hasn't advanced beyond the point of the stone age? The original 6 were mostly highly intelligent scientists and astronauts but they didn't teach anything to their children? Not even how to read and write?,2
1318,"This explanation was so dumb, that six astronauts could not manage to get off an island, teach their kids actual science, or get a hold of any modern resources rather than reverting back to cavemen.",0
1319,The astronauts died early leaving a singer and a teacher,2
1320,"They were all astronauts, regardless of being scientists or not. And could not leave an island, after leaving space. How many yeas was it before the first child or wedding that they had not  built some sort of raft?",2
1321,Have you tried crossing an ocean in a wooden raft? It’s basically a suicide mission over any distance larger than 16-18h,2
1322,"They had years, on an island that apparently did have inhabitants. We also saw the pod in the island, so they could have salvaged resources off of it. But apparently did nothing in years, until someone got sick, when they got desperate.",2
1323,"That inhabitant was just a lone hermit. Also they are astronauts, not carpenters. They have some basic survival knowledge but crafting a ship that is 100% safe for all of them, and can cross a several hundred mile sea is just out of the question. They could not risk dying at the sea, which is exactly what happened to the Russian couple when they tried to do so.",2
1324,"You say that like the show does not have Senku, who can literally do everything. Even the guy who was supposed to be mostly the strongest has what would be unrealistic knowledge, yet a bunch of adult astronauts reverted back to the stone age. It has actually been the inconsistency by which some people are geniuses while others are idiots that has annoyed me.     If this was even a foreseeable event, why did the astronauts decide to land somewhere so remote? Sure there was the explanation that they thought it would be safe, but what was their plan once they got there? There was nothing they could have taken from the space station?    The society must have somehow got off the island eventually, but they still seem pretty stuck with no knowledge. We are meant to believe that the weird stories that were meant to teach things, managed to stay intact for over 3,000 years, without warping, but not their actual culture knowing what anything science is? Apparently his father believed that Senku could come back, but nothing we have seen about their culture has shown an awareness of the stone people. Just feels like very specific knowledge.",2
1325,"     Senku cannot do literally everything though.          Because Shamil's crew missed Japan during their descent, and they were forced to land on the island to save them in time, like it was clrearly stated in the episode. It was not about how safe the island is, they were originally planning for mainland Japan.",2
1326,"He not only knows but is a master chemistry, physics, geology, medicine and applications from cooking to turning pelts into clothing. If there is anything science, which can literally be almost anything, he knows how to do it. Why would he even know how to create glasses? I at least thing his knowledge should have been split across one person who knew general sciences of chemistry and physics, and another person with biology and medical knowledge. Whether he is unnable to have crazy physical strength, does not stop him from being unninterestingly overpowered.",2
1327,"I mean...I'm not a scientific genius but I'm mostly familiar with the production and details on most of the stuff he made or gathered so far. Glass is very basic for example, it's mostly just molten silica. Also a perfect example to show that Senku doesn't just magically knows everything: He knew how to produce glass, but he didn't have the faintest idea how to actually make it to cups and vials. If you spend the majority of years learning science, there is nothing about Senku that seems extraordinary, except for his calculations.",2
1328,"Byakuya and crew were on an island that had some people but no medicine.  They were close enough to row to ""a mainland"".  Also, the village is the same village where Byakuya started, but some how that is on the mainland of Japan near Hakone...?  Doesn't add up unless this village is not the first island.  Three thousand years?  You could have a decent population spread out pretty far.",2
1329,"No, they landed in some god forsaken Pacific island  they missed Japan, where they actually tried to land  and were trapped there because the best they had was a row boat. Eventually they were forced to try and row all the way to the mainland  and clearly failed . Eventually their descendants moved to Japan proper due to unexplained reaons  it can be assumed Byakuya's 100 stories had something to do with it .",2
1330,Oh wow finally someone who actually payed attention to the episode,1
1331,Except we see the grave of Byakuya.  That has to be the location where he died and if he never left the island then that's the location where he lived.   And it's also the location within walking distance of Senku's school...,2
1332,"But in the very first episodes it's clearly established that the series takes place in mainland Japan, while in this episode the astronauts were stranded on a relatively small island. It seems that when the descendants of the astronauts rediscovered the art of sailing and made the journey to Japan they brought the graves or perhaps just the gravestones with them.",2
1333,Its seems the author didn't think it through did he what a glaring oversight. If the astronauts were able to build a rocket ship to space why could they do the same with boata. Makes no sense really.,2
1334,"Right, because graes are made of neutronium and anchored by quantum locking. It's not like they can't, I don't know, pick up the grave as they move.    Aslo, a hundred kilometers if not more  where Ishigami village is  is ""walking distance"", sure. But I don't think it's what we would normally call as such.    Did you miss the part where they landed in an unhabited island? Maybe you shouldn't speedwatch.",0
1335,...,2
1336,Did they land on an island near South America or Japan? They could have built a raft or something to the mainland and scavange for medicine and supplies existing tech like the walking dead does and have had better chances at survival than in an island.,2
1337,They landed somewhere in the Pacific  they were aiming for Japan .,2
1338,Did anybody even watch the episode? This is like the 10th time I’ve seen someone suggest they go to the mainland for supplies. In the middle of the episode THEY LITERALLY TRIED THAT. The doctor couple left on a boat and never returned!,1
1339,I'm honestly surprised that byakuya got together with the singer. My theory before watching the episode was that he would go to earth alone for a few years and something would happen to him. The team would then go looking for him or get lost along the way. In his memory they'd name the village after him and would restart society. Byakuya would have written the rules for senku to find and maybe the singer would turn them into songs to pass down. The direction they ended up taking felt a little rushed and convoluted honestly. Everyone just died in like what the span of 5 years and however long byakuya and the singer were together before she died too? It was an okay episode but I feel it jumped through too many hoops to set up the plot for what happens in senku time.,1
1340,"They died of diseases, not crazy to think they could die in a short period...",2
1341,Why didn’t they try to go back to the main land?,2
1342,They literally did in the episode... they never returned...,2
1343,Why didnt they move to a place with more resources like cars and medicine? Instead they started a village from nothing? Why not go somewhere with alot of resources that solidified humans didnt need anymore?,2
1344,Because the continental land is hundreds of kilometers away.,2
1345,"Given how smart all of those astronauts were and how much time they had, I thought they would have at least tried to build a ship to get to a more developed area. Then, they could have rebuilt society themselves and probably eventually figured out how to unpetrify people. Really cool episode, but I'm disappointed that the author didn't even address that. Building a boat is definitely something they should have been capable of.",0
1346,"Because two of them left for the mainland and never returned, so they probably decided it was a really bad idea to try? Also they’re astronauts, not ship builders",2
1347,"Two of them left for the mainland after a few years of living there, so they had plenty of time beforehand. There were human populations on many islands in the pacific ocean many thousands of years ago. It's believed that they used very primitive boats, essentially connected logs, to do so. Modern humans would not need to be shipbuilders to cross stretches of ocean. And even if they didn't know how to build a ship, they could have at least tried...",2
1348,"Oh yeah, because knowing you’re one of the last 6 conscious humans left in the world really makes you think “hey, I should throw myself into an ocean voyage in the little boat I managed to make. There’s a small chance I might make it!”",2
1349,"Their entire reason to go down to earth was to save the rest of humanity. They were clearly unable to do that without leaving the island. If there was such a small chance of them making it, they shouldn't have sent 1 3 of their adult population like they did later.     Also, they should be able to make a durable boat given the time they had and how intelligent they are. Making a boat is not rocket science... Humans were able to reach islands in Oceania over 3400 years ago, which involves a few sections way more than 200 km between islands. And these people had almost none of the knowledge we have today.",2
1350,"They sent 1 3 of their population because they were afraid ALL of them might die from disease. At that point, they were desperate and had no other choice.    And on your other point, those cases are from societies where there were craftsmen who had specific knowledge of building boats. You say it’s not rocket science? Build your own boat then and sail across an ocean. I doubt you’d trust your ability to do it, I definitely wouldn’t trust mine",2
1351,It's clear we have very different perceptions of the capabilities of astronauts,2
1352,"Yo Iam so confused, why did 2 of the last survivors leave the island to go find antibiotics? were they even on an island? if so, how did Senku reach the village? and how can the children remember 100 stories? Its an anime so I guess its like that XD",1
1353,"seku isn't on the island, he's in japan that's how he was able to navigate to the buddha statue.  At some point they must have gotten out and traveled to japan, I here they are making a spin off manga about this or something.",2
1354,"Ok but senku's dad was buried on the island with everyone else, senku must be on the island because je he saw his dads grave, unless they moved all the bodies xD, That's why I'm confused af.",1
1355,"Senku even said that his father died over 3000 years ago so there wouldn't even be dust left. It's not hard to imagine that the ""graves"" they visited are more symbolic than actual graves.",2
1356,"Yeah i suppose that could work, but the grave stone looks exactly the same. Any thanks for clearing that up,",1
1357,"Can anyone explain how such a small gene pool could have survived without horrible defects  mutations for over 3 millennia?     ;    Edit: Okay, so I wrote it down on a sticky note, and if the initial 6 people plan correctly, they can create 9 different bloodlines, each of which are half related to 4, and unrelated to the other 4.    If we represent the original 6 as numbers, where   Odd = one gender   Even = the other one,      it doesn't really matter      People 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, & 6 can make the following bloodlines:      12        14        16    32        34        36    52        54        56    So a person from parents 1 + 2 can safely reproduce with a person from 3+4, 3+6, 5+4, and 5+6 and so on.     ;    Although realistically, I'm pretty sure the author just wanted us to suspend our disbelief for the sake of the story",2
1358,Maybe that's why you can park a bus between the female characters' eyes.,2
1359,"So basically what I'm getting is: If they had landed the Soyuz near any inhabited land mass, humanity would not have regressed. Also 5 NASA scientists  and one singer  combined can't build a boat.",2
1360,Have you tried crossing a several hundred kilometer long ocean on a makeshift rowboat?,2
1361,"His kid made antibiotics, I think he can do this at least with 5 genius intellects and 1 singer.",2
1362,"I find it hard to believe that six astronauts couldn't figure out the depetrification formula or find the materials to do so, and that since it was the start of the petrification era, they couldn't build a bigger boat to go to nearest city and thrive off the technology that remains.    I mean they're astronauts, they should have advanced knowledge of chemistry and physics that's similar to Senku's level of those subjects, and there is lots of trees on that island that could be used to build a big boat, its not rocket science, but no just have them leave it all to byakura's son instead.    Edit: Nvm these problems are mostly explained in the comment replies below",2
1363,"How would the astronauts even come up with the idea that the depetrification can be undone with chemicals? They had absolutelyno leads, nor resources, while Senku on the other hand experienced it first hand and woke up right next to his answer. Even then it took him a year to perfect the formula and he is supposed to be an uber genius.",2
1364,"Yeah true, they had no leads, and Senku was insanely lucky to find that cave, but I doubt they didn't have resources and similar caves on that island. I just figured, they would eventually figure out that nitric acid could be used, but you're right, since thats not all they would need to depetrify people so I was wrong on that account.",1
1365,"The ""cave of miracles"" is named just for that reason. You can get nitric acid out of poop however it requires a chemical reaction. The cave Senkuu found was a 1 in a million. The only resource they had were a plantation patch the hermit had  which would not feed 6 people  and a survival kit. They did make a little boat the Russian couple used but never came back  which shows how dangerously far from mainland they were . Their original plan was to look for survivors in the farthest location from the source of petrification. After establishing that they really are the last 6 survivors making a danggerous journey and risking total extinction was out of the question. They might have experimented, we don't know the details, however no result was found. At least that's what the anime implies.",1
1366,"Bat caves are not that uncommon so I doubt it was 1 in a million considering how much bats poop, and they clearly had more resources than that otherwise they wouldn't have survived.    That beautifully crafted boat was very quickly made to save the first descenders from the ISS, so imagine how quick Byakura could make a big one, and he didn't even have the survival kit until after he rescued them, so lord knows how he made it so quickly.    I know they were far from mainland, but how did their ancestors eventually make it to same island Senku was? My point is that they all should have ventured to mainland much, much earlier than they did or had tried, instead of just dying from pneumonia and making babies.",2
1367,"For some reason your new reply refuses to show up, so I cannot directly respond to it. I could read it from your profile however. Simple bat caves do not generate nitric acid by themselves, there are other factors at play. The boat belonged to the hermit  explained in the manga but not included in the adaptation . The boat the Russian couple used had a mast, not the same boat. Because of low numbers and workforce to build a large sailing vessel they planned to postpone their trip. Their descendants brought the remains to mainland after their death. Spoilers are involved in that explanation so I won't go into that.",2
1368,"Oh ok yea and reddit is messed today same problem, I guess the anime skipped some things from the manga that would've explained some things and I wasn't able to connect the dots or I had forgot, but makes sense and thanks for explaining and not spoiling me",2
1369,I don't think this makes any sense.    At the end it showed there was just four kids and Byakuya left alive.    How the hell did the village get started off that?    UNless the Russians came back or found more people somehow.,0
1370,There were more kids. Each scene only shows a few. But it's assumed every couple had at least 2 kids.,2
1371,That still only leaves 6 people.,2
1372,"Well, yeah. I was just explaining the numbers.     ;    Also, it is  assumed  each one had two, there may have been more.",2
1373,"I'll probably get down-voted for this, but honestly it was a bad episode.  The whole island story made very little sense and I felt actually detracted from the overall story. I'd almost recommend that people skip the first half the episode rather then watching it.",0
1374,Weren't all their graves in South America? How did Byakuya and the other's graves move from South America to Japan,2
1375,Intreating how many missed the source of the petrification beam was South America making Japan the farthest point away.     This gave a in story reason for them to pick Japan which as a very Mountainous place a horrible place to try to land a capsule on land on as it's also not that wide as far as landing is concerned as well.,2
1376,They landed near Japan to be far away from South America. Senku's dad got out voted.,2
1377,"  Really don't like the english singing, like bleh.      Byakuya is the GOAT here.      Kinda funny how most characters look like their ancestors from 3700 years ago.",0
1378,"So the ISS crew landed in South America, and over 3700 years their kids managed to get to Japan? There must be a ton of humans scattered around the globe then, right? Are villages around the world called Ishigami village?",2
1379,"they landed close to japan because south america was the ground zero of the petrifying ""explosion"", and they wanted to be as far away from it as possible",2
1380,"What exactly was Senku crying about? He was thinking about the depressing 3000 years of counting or something?    Also, are we really supposed to believe that 100 stories were passed down orally for 3000+ years and they are still completely accurate? AND Senku just happened to find this village of his father's direct descendants less than a year after breaking out?    I love this show man but the plot in these 2 episodes has been a bit much for me.",0
1381,"     Hmm that, or maybe the fact that after hearing the story he's finally come to conclusion that he will NEVER see his father again, everyone he loved is potentially gone and now he has a tremendous weight on his shoulder to bring back the human race from the brink of extinction.         Except they're not all completely accurate, when Chrom was talking about Momotaro Senku said that while it's definitaly the momotaro he knows of it's been changed.",1
1382,"the fact senku was able to count the seconds for three thousand years, or that imediatly after gaining consciousness tsukasa was able to just body a lion wasn't already enough?",2
1383,"You're right, I had just hoped they would stop pulling stuff like that.",1
1384,     If you're hoping for stuff like that then you should probably stop watching shonen.,1
1385,"These past two episodes make no sense whatsoever. 6 people, god damned astronauts to boot, spawned over a hundred generations and all they have to show for it is a tiny village and absolutely no technology. They didn't even bother going into the fully functional cities to scavenge.     If they had just left it at ""some dudes depetrified"" the story would make so much more sense. This whole backstory is just plain fucking dumb, instead of doing anything whatsoever they decided to wait thousands of years for a kid that might not be coming back.",0
1386,"I see you missed the part where the astronauts have landed on an island in the middle of the sea. Very little amount of resources, almost no minerals and no leftover tech equipment to salvage. The Russian couple DID try to go to the continental area for medicine but presumably died because it’s hundreds of kilometres away.    Ishigami village on the other hand is on the Japanese island...it is NOT the original island village.",2
1387,"I thought the same about different islands but the cementary with the tombstones of the founders doesn't support that, I guess that could be like a myth or something",2
1388,"Hey, you know the part where you said they made it to Nippon, that means it's possible to make the trip. Just the fact that the village isn't on the island is a bit of a spoiler that it's possible.    SO even if all the original people died, they still had the manpower to make it to mainland, they had the information to make it to Japan and presumably some tech to aid. They passed by civilization on the way, unless they on purpose avoided everything.    There's absolutely no way in hell they'd be in this state after that long a time with that great a starting condition.",0
1389,"     Yes,  many  generations later.     ;    Once they re-discovered how to make capable enough craft and had the numbers to afford loses during the travel.     ;              That's because you are assuming they went back to Japan in a generation or two  while there was still any tech to recover  and not in, say, 1000 years later.",2
1390,     And yet also conveniently how to transport large numbers of gravestones with them?,2
1391,"You can assume a few coups, several civil wars and a few belief movements that threaten technology as well over thousands of years. History has many examples of Civilization collapses.   Storytelling a good back up plan. Many cultures research has shown have kept stories for thousands of years. Storytelling culture requires the person learning them learn them totally and change nothing. Don't confuse with what happened in Civilizations which developed writing which replaced Storytelling. In Civilizations telling tales then became entertainment with entertainers often changing them. Mythology has many different versions because of different sources from different places and written for entertainment stuff like the Iliad and Odyssey.",2
1392,"A few slabs of stone  we only saw Byakuya's, but we can assume they took all of the Last Six's gravestones  are not really that hard to move. The rest of the gravestones are probably from the villagers after they settled there.",2
1393,Everything will be answered later.,2
1394,But Senku did come back. Way better to make some kids than to die in the middle of the ocean.,1
1395,This shit with Senku's father honestly makes his character worse imo. Was better when he was just a kid who liked science with a supportive father who sold his car to buy him shit. Also making him adopted just so he's not related to half the village is dumb as hell.,0
1396,How does it make his character worse? It doesn’t change anything about him.,1
1397,He didnt want to go to space until his dad said he wanted to. Him being a kid curious about science on his own was better.,1
1398,This episode made very little logical sense in lieu of story telling and I thought Senku's dad was pretty stupid.,0
1399,man the singing was cringe. the words i mean. no disrespect meant to the voice actress who did a stellar job,0
1400,"I just wish story progression was a bit faster ... at this rate it's like bookworm, slow as hell    kinda gets me off",0
1401,Always on fridays,2
1402,"Depends on your timezones, here in Australia it's always early sat morning.",2
1403,"Ah my bad, its 3pm release in the uk",1
1404,It has always aired on Fridays.,2
