1,I can't wait to see petrification  island arc,2
2,I like that it wasn't Senku coming up with an invention for once. It's good to see Chrome's innovative side coming out every now and then.,1
3,"Just as Senku said even if Tsukasa had killed him, there's always an idiot who'll try anything.",0
4,Chrome is the idiot we deserve.,0
5,"That's the biggest thing about Senku's goal. He's not satisfied with just eventually getting the world back to proper form: He wants to get there as quickly as possible, and then go beyond. Tsukasa's goals only work in the short term and would result in failure over time.",0
6,"Tsukasa also thinks that he's going to prevent war and conflict, but he's the one who tried to kill Senku.   He's the one trying to burn down a village.   He's the one taking hostages.    That's not to say Ishigami village is a utopia.   After all, it has people like Magma.   But  Tsukasa has a major God complex and he seems to believe that he can solve all problems by getting rid of science, and that's doomed to failure.    Plus, it's not like basic tools like spears, or fire, or clothing, aren't science.",0
7,"Yeah that's the same as the church trying to stop Galileo Galilei, even if you stop him the science eventually will get there",0
8,"The idea that the Catholic Church tried to hinder the advancement of Science is a myth though. Galileo was placed under house arrest because of a personal dispute with the pope. That, and he was widely hated by many of his contemporaries not for his scientific views but because he was, simply put, an asshole.     If anything, the Catholic Church was responsible for preserving much of the knowledge of the ancient world when the Western Roman Empire fell. That, and they were a major patron of the sciences and the arts. Many of its clergymen were even scientists and even until today that fact holds true.",1
9,"Maybe you are right and he was an asshole but after the dispute the church also obligated him to say that the moon is perfect, that the earth was not moving but the sun, even if he knew that it wasnt like that, and other things I dont remember because I studied it 6 years ago",2
10,"I think that was simply another way for the pope and Galileo’s other enemies to get back at him. Whenever I think of the Galileo affair I tend to remember Sheldon Cooper from the Big Bang Theory. Imagine if Leonard and co., instead of tolerating Sheldon’s behavior, decided to get him fired and succeeds in doing so.",0
11,"Then they'd be assholes for doing it.    Someone being annoying doesn't justify such drastic measures.    If they're an asshole, just don't spend time with them.",0
12,"Have you even watched the show? That would be impossible for Leonard since he’s roommates with Sheldon. Also, Sheldon during the earlier seasons was very arrogant to the point that it went beyond annoying. If Leonard and co. actually got rid of him, I wouldn’t have mind one bit.",0
13,I imagine Chrome would have been a child prodigy if he'd have been born 3700 years ago,2
14,He    is    a child prodigy.    He fucking almost harnessed electricity. That's equivalent to Tesla and Edison. Exactly how much of a child prodigy do you need to be in order to achieve that.,2
15,Agreed. He actually    is   .,1
16,And in a world with arguably way less technology.,0
17,"I mean I'm sure some people did magic tricks with static electricity, they just had no clue. I mean when I rub my pillows in the dark I can get sparks. I doubt none of that EVER happened before their era.",0
18,Dude wtf are your pillows made of?,0
19,I can get sparks from my cotton pillows too... should i fill in a customer complain?,0
20,"Pillows, blankets, sheets... it's very common to get static from them. I hate waking up with messed up hair because of static charge.",0
21,"My cat has static too, especially during the winter. I actually saw his entire fur was glowing blue at the middle of night.",2
22,What pokemon are you raising??,2
23,"To be fair, he didn't really harness electricity. He figured out that if you need to turn something continuously, you can use a constant water flow to do it. His contraption was entirely mechanical, and while extremely impressive, he'd never have figured out electricity if not for Senku.",1
24,They're talking about the static electricity he used when chrome was first trying to show off to senku,2
25,"     ??? What’s this in reference to? If it’s the static electricity ball he made, people were making batteries in the Bronze Age to hold and discharge electricity.",2
26,"Yeah, but they're in the  stone  age for all intents & purposes.",1
27,"     Except they aren't, when they've been solidly making  iron  for a while now.",2
28,He almost did that BEFORE the iron making.,2
29,"""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."" - Issac Newton.    Chrome just had the misfortune of being born in a time where the giants had been lost. Until Senku came along to lift him back up.",0
30,"He harnessed water-powered mechanical machinery. Still impressive, but not as impressive.    It's also worth noting that there are people all over who come to conclusions that accomplished scientists already came up with first. If someone on their own figured out how to make a light bulb, that wouldn't make headlines, because we already know how to make light bulbs. But if they had existed  prior  to light bulbs becoming commonplace, they'd be labeled a genius and a visionary.",1
31,What person has never seen a light bulb?,2
32,"None. I think you're missing my point on purpose. The point is that there are concepts and developments people might never have explained to them, but if they discover them on their own, they aren't treated as geniuses because redundant discoveries aren't seen as breakthroughs. Which means we have probably ignored a lot of ""genius"" over the years.",0
33,I understood the point was just making a joke about the use of a person not seeing a lightbulb as an example. I think you were missing that on purpose though.,2
34,Henry Cavendish. He was a genius but was so antisocial that he never let anyone know about his researches when he was alive. Posthumously people finally got to see his manuscripts and realized he figured out Ohm's Law and Charles's Law of electricity way before the actual discoveries by Ohm or Charles.,1
35,Ok but his hypothetical was talking about modern time. The odds of a person never seeing a lightbulb and somehow discovering it on their own today are next to zero.,1
36,"Well the hypothetical part isn’t about whether there is a person in modern times who have never seen a lightbulb. It’s about, if that person ever existed, he is a genius if he can invent a lightbulb.",1
37,"My god, whoosh.    I understood the point dude, thanks lol",1
38,"To be fair, he did have Kaseki help him build it, but he did come up with the concept.",1
39,No he's not. He's over 3000 years old. You can't be a child prodigy if you're 3000.,0
40,"We are talking about Chrome, not Senku.",2
41,I mean he is being guided by someone who knows it all already.,2
42,"He's definitely a prodigy. He just needed someone to help him hone those gifts that the other villagers would've just brushed off as ""just another rock collecting kid"" If he had been born 3700 years ago, he likely would be that genius kid who discovered a cure for cancer and built AI's without an issue.",2
43,I'd almost argue that if he had been born around the same time as senku he'd probably be the smarter one.,1
44,"Chrome literally re-invented the waterwheel and the first step towards an electronic engine. If senku disappears, he will bring back science to its glory.",1
45,"After hydroelectricity, all he'd have to come up with is the electric motor and batteries to build the foundation of modern society.  And maybe the general concept of the assembly line",2
46,"     Oh yes, just these two small things. Easy peasy.",1
47,"Batteries are in Senku's roadmap for the communicator, so it's halfway there!",2
48,They now have a way of making extremely long wires and they already seem to have magnets at their disposal. Those are the key components of an electric motor! Not to mention they can make cast iron too.,2
49,"I wonder how will he do that, I doubt they can get any Lithium",0
50,"He can get zinc, I'm sure. With that, an alkaline batter is more than what they need for a wireless phone.",1
51,"...    Are you serious?    Lithium ion batteries are some of the most modern batteries we have, we've had batteries for a lot longer.    A battery literally just needs electrodes and electrolyte.",0
52,Woa-oh! It's living on a prayer!,2
53,"most electrical engineers dont know who to make a decent battery, its impressivebullshit how senku knows so much about many different things",2
54,"Well yeah, they're actually fairly simple. For the electric motor, he wants some wire and a magnet, both of which he has by now. Make a coil in the wire. Putting electricity through it gives it an electromagnetic field. If you put this next to a magnet and turn the electromagnet on and off repeatedly it will spin. If you build it so the circuit is broken in one half of the circle it spins around and connected for the other half this happens on its own. Tada, electric motor.    For the battery, make a bunch of small copper and zinc plates. Soak some cardboard or other absorbent medium in a 4:1 salt watervinegar mix note on salt water: start out with purified water and then just add salt until you can't dissolve any more in it. Layer copper, zinc, and cardboard repeatedly you should end this stack on a zinc plate and wrap it in something perhaps some of that plastic he's planning on making. Make connector points on both ends. You now have a battery.",1
55," Ok, but how would a cave boy with no understanding of electricity ever come up with the idea to make and utilize those? Just because it's easy to make them doesnt mean it's easy to invent them.",1
56,"By using that walking encyclopedia of science that happens to be spending all his time on fast-tracking a technological revolution in your village, I suppose. Inventing this stuff is easy when you have a giant to stand on the shoulders of.",1
57,"Aliens, clearly.",1
58,Reading this I can safely say my IQ is probably less than 50,1
59,"he already has magnets, but you could also create one without magnets. inner and outer layer of coils",1
60,What you just said isn't simple for someone who has to find it out on his own and he doesn't has that knowledge.,2
61,If only he was being constantly accompanied by a leek-haired guy who happens to be a walking encyclopedia on modern technology. Sadly that would be way too convenient so it is definitely not the situation he's in.,2
62,"or they could just make a water power cell, use all that power to pump water into a tall vessel and have a thing that will let it spew water out to a water wheel",2
63,Except it would take more power to try and power the water wheel than they would generate like that.  The reason the water wheel works is because they're taking advantage of the current from the river.,1
64,right I think the thing I was thinking about is a solar storage cell or something,2
65,"Yes, but the idea is just to store energy, it doesn't matter if you have some loss, as long as it allows you to keep that energy to be used on demand.",1
66,Do you not know what a perpetual motion machine is???  That's what you're proposing.      If you spend energy to move the water up then you're not making any extra energy to store.  You're losing energy to friction and then spending more energy to move the water back up.    Hence all you would get is a temporary machine that would be able to spin maybe once or twice...,1
67,"No, that is not at all what I'm proposing, how in the fuck did you twist my words in your head so badly as to misinterpret what I said in such a way?    It's just like a battery, you store energy to be used later.    There is no infinite energy, it's just that with a device such as a waterwheel, you can have periods of wastage and periods of underflow.     Taking excess energy and storing it for when you may need to later supplement your supply is a very useful ability to have.",1
68,"Electric motors are fairly simple to make, I think they already have all the ingredients for that. I think batteries are fairly simple as well.",1
69,"If they have an electric generator, the can make an electric engine. Principles and materials are the same. They also can create cables, so they can make it next episode.",1
70,"The first battery was built in Mesopotamia around Jesus's time although scholars aren't sure what they used it for.    With some of the blocks laid out for you, it only becomes a matter of getting the right materials together to make it work.",0
71,"wait, you do realize why your first sentence doesn't work out right? Mesopotamia fell a while before the supposed time of Jesus. The Baghdad Battery is a thing yes, but that timespan doesn't quite fit.",0
72,I'm mean we've actually had batteries for thousands of years. they just weren't used for anything.,2
73,"Not even close! Modern society is more about computing and global access. The internet is the new baseline foundation to modern society, and is on the brink of being a basic human right. Society has spent so many resources developing small electronics, creating standard platformsprogramming languages, and communication methods via the Internet to make these devices usable.     I think the foundation of modern society is much more about math and science related to computing. He doesn't even know what a computer yet!! Nowhere close to modern society...",1
74,I mean they already got that with hard labor.,0
75,"You're forgetting the most important part of modern society, the cubicle.",1
76,I can't believe Chrome accidentally created a waterwheel that ultimately functions as a power plant lmao,1
77,I completely agree it was very refreshing to see someone other than Senku make something. But I was also nice to see the softer non-war side him as well with his offering. Shows you that he really believes science is for everyone.,1
78,Senku create things that already existed in his time.   So they weren't truly inventions not that they were any less impressive.  Chrome created something that he has never seen before.  That's why even Senku is impressed by it.,1
79,That's the beauty of this series. The other characters have their moments of ingenuity.,1
80,Ye but i like how the road map is going from plastic to micro elements of circuit board right away in a single step... that sum crazy mojodojo sciency magic eh,2
81,Its funny how we are watching that is akin to World War 3 now in this anime as they are most likely the only humans alive.,1
82,SSJ Craftsman,2
83,"We all thought Tsukasa was the strongest character in the series, but we keep ignoring that Kaseki is probably capable of destroying planets in a single blast.",0
84,Clearly the key to beating Tsukasa and Hyoga is to just have Kaseki go wild on them,0
85,"""Tsukasa wants to destroy your works and stop you from making more.""  Wait a few seconds and Tsukasa dies from being Kamehamehaed.",0
86,"Kaseki gets powerful upon the prospect of creating something though, not defending something. Clearly, they need to suggest that Tsukasa's skull would make for some excellent crafting material.",1
87,     Most underrated comment I've seen in a while  ಠ ͜ಠ,2
88,Then he shall create death,0
89,this is some monster hunter level shit,0
90,"""Let me tell you about this thing you can make with human bones""",2
91,Just tell him that Tsukasa wants to break his iron saw.,2
92,"The question is, can we come up with a project exciting enough to set him off to that degree?",1
93,Kaioken!!!!,2
94,So I'm not the only one who saw Kaio there.,2
95,Kaiowhat,2
96,Kaio-crap!,2
97,that shockwave is nicely animated,1
98,awekening to conqueror haki,2
99,"Time to re-petrify, revive me in 3700 years.",1
100,"How has no one made that into a gif yet?     SMH, gotta do everything yourself",0
101,"You didn't miss the quote at the end, Perfectly cut. The only one thing I could think extra would be ""That's suspicious"" right afterwards.",1
102,Nah with how red he is it's Kaio.    Edit: Or at least mystic.,0
103,Homura with her acrobatic abilities might have had a background with circuses and carnivals. You could faintly hear the sound of a festival or event as she tasted the candy.    That cotton candy sure must have brought back a lot of memories.....,1
104,Damn i interpreted it as she was missing civilization by remembering japanese summer festivals those ones with yukatas and such.,0
105,"I think that was definitely what they were insinuating.    She might have been a gymnastcircus performer, but those were iconic natsumatsuri sounds.",1
106,"Gymnast was my guess last episode. After the cotton candy-induced food reaction though, carnival performer acrobat is likely spot-on.",2
107,"That was my take.    Senku is using science the way it  should  be used. Give freely and count on the good outweighing the bad. If the good happens to recruit people for you, and your means and ends are just, then good on ya.    He's establishing a  reputation  among Team Tsukasa. Here's a man who  could  be monstrous in his actions, but who is working to restore all the creature comforts you used to know.",1
108,Funny how some comments keep pushing for poisons and weapons. These guys are most likely Tsukasas goons,0
109,Why wouldn't you kill those who try to attack your place of residence. Castle doctrine.,1
110,Are you a psychopath or why do you think it's OK to kill people?,0
111,This is World War 3 man. If someone wants to take over your place you kill them.,0
112,Laws are merely a social construct. When threaten you are allowed to retaliate.,0
113,There are plenty of other options to neutralize a perceived threat. By immediately escalating the situation with the use of lethal force you only needlessly put your own life on the line.,0
114,"Humans' brains are designed to avoid killing other humans, it's an evolutionary acquired trait to preserve the survival of the species. That's why killing others has become a taboo, it simply causes extreme emotional distress to most people, unless you are trained to do so. Researches about Civil War and WW1 soldiers revealed that most of them tried to avoid killing at any costs even if their lives were on the stake. That's why they have developed of modern training curriculum for soldiers including the psychological aspects.  Senku is, besides being a genius, just a normal high schooler never trained in war or combat. He can't actually go killing right away, so this is actually a pretty realistic depiction.",0
115,He is basically a drug lord now.  Giving out candy is like crack for these people.     When will get make beer.,1
116,thatw as my thought exactly,2
117,Nice catch!  That subtle background sound,1
118,I was thinking more along the lines of gymnastics.,2
119,I think it just made her remember the lively japanese festivals where you can buy cotton candy and enjoy. So it could still be anything.,1
120,I also thought i was just general festivals but carnival also makes sense.,1
121,My exact though after the first few jumps in the last episode,2
122,Sounded like a traditional Japanese festival. Like the ones you see in every slice of life ever during the summer break episodes. I assumed she was just reminiscing about those festivals.,1
123,Can we talk about how she licked the cotton candy though? Who even licks cotton candy?,2
124,She could have fed it to an animal like Senku suggested.,1
125,"Ikr, she licks it like it was an icecream",1
126,I've been thinking the same thing since she first showed up.,2
127,We Shokugeki No Stone now bois !,0
128,But I already watched this week's episode!,2
129,Okay but I'd legit pay to see a crossover of Shokugeki No Soma and Dr. Stone. Totsuki'd all be petrified too.,0
130,Oh...    Oh I know exactly what your alluding too. ; I'm not talking about that character.,2
131,Imagine Erina trying out Senku's Ramen...,2
132,"""Disgusting!!!""",2
133,The reactions are better than Soma’s,1
134,"Chrome said some words of wisdom today:     Oh, Damn! Oh, Damn! Oh, Damn! Oh, Damn! Oh, Damn!",0
135,  YA      BE,2
136," The conversation's IQ just dropped by, like, a hundred. ",1
137, やべ,2
138,I fucking love it when he says that YA BEEEEEEEIII.,1
139,that was a good explanation of how radio waves work,1
140,I genuinely didn't understand how sound was converted to radio waves until now.,2
141,"And that are 3 oh, damn's ladies and gentlemen",2
142,oh damn!,0
143,You get it,2
144,We all know Chrome is the superior firebender.,1
145,Nah man you create the chidori in the palm of your hand,1
146,Legit thought he was doing the hand signs,1
147,All anime scientists gain Plot Armour when showing off their experiments. We also don't know the Voltage see the famous science fair when Tesla was sat reading next to a coil that was constantly zapping around him.,1
148,I hope you understood the reference,1
149,"You know how some shows are so good that the episodes feel like they're over in an instant? This feels like the other way around: so much happened that I could've sworn this was longer than 25 minutes.    I really like Gen's role as the only other 3,500-year-old in the village. He's the only one who really realizes how ridiculous the things are that Senku is proposing.",1
150,Gen's reactions to the fucking insane shit Senku and the gang get up to is one of my reasons to live.,0
151,The villagers: What's our first step to making a cell phone?    Senku: Cotton candy!    Gen: Why is our only hope a nutcase?,1
152,sounds like a conversation among my D&D group,1
153,"""Oh, okay, so we're making a device that makes your voice go somewhere far away? That's really cool.""    ""No, see, you don't understand. Everything this man just said is  insane .""",0
154,"Yeah, Gen is basically us as the viewer. He says what a lot of us are thinking when Senku mentions something like a cell phone and so its like we get a reaction to our thoughts.",1
155,"Gen adds a lot to this show, I'm really glad he sided with the science side.",1
156,Good shows have 15min episodes. Great shows have 35min episodes.,1
157,"I really enjoy that Senku has a friend he can talk to about old world things with.  Gen's probably going to become one of my favorite characters soon, which is a hard call given how many damn good characters there are in this show.",1
158,Gen has had surprisingly great chemistry with Senku.,1
159,"God damn, you know a series is good when an entire episode is literally just them making cotton candy but making it look epic.    Also that ending, I was starting to think that Chrome was just a puppy dog following behind Senku, but this episode actually showed that he has the right mind for science, he's one of those people Senku mentioned that exist in every century who are just naturally gifted.",1
160,"He and Kaseki are an amazing pair, yeah they both needed Senku to open up their minds to new ideas and possibilities but they are both clearly the type of people that only need the smallest spark of an idea to revolutionize their world.",1
161,These However the latter acknowledges that he wouldn't come this far without them and does not take their potential for granted. It's really nice how they function as a true team rather than the protagonist doing everything like in many other shounens.     gintamathispleasesme,1
162,I don't even think Senku is smarter than them. He just has information they lack in addition to being a genius in his own right.,1
163,"Senku's super power is essentially being human Wikipedia so far and willpower, though we do see him do some pretty tough math at points.",1
164,in his head with no calculator      ;    i studied those subjects and cant do it even if u gave me a whole notebook to work it out,0
165,I'm sure he's hiding a calculator in that hairdo.,2
166,Don't forget that the first thing that he did in the series was keep count of time by manually counting seconds in his head FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.,1
167,Have you come to the point of checking on the calculator if 2x2 is really 4?,2
168,Every god damn time I write a test. You HAVE to make sure that maths didn't somehow change overnight,1
169,He's both a hard drive and a processor!,0
170,"I don't think managing to stay conscious and sane for 3700 years, with only his mind, while also calculating the year and season falls under information",2
171,I think Se ku probably is smarter than them. He's essentially to science what Tsukasa is to physicality. Superhuman and unrivaled in his field. The same way Kohaku is an incredibly gifted warrior but absolutely no match for Tsukasa.,0
172,"To be fair, I think it's pretty heavily implied that Tsukasa isn't that much dumber than Senku, and would be almost as good with technology had his life went a different direction.",1
173,"Yeah, I think anyone who has read a book like ""how to Invent Everything - Ryan North"" could probably pull off something.    Not plugging the book at all this show just reminds me of it a lot. It's basically a guide to rebuilding if you somehow time travelled into the stone age and got stuck. I'd say the book is kind of interesting but also quickly gets kind of boring.",0
174,"i dont think chroms memory is even close to senkus, most people in his situation wouldnt remember so many details even if they knew how things worked and were made",2
175,"It also takes a toll that Chrome has been rejected by the village for his interests and experiments. Who knows what he would have done should he have had support and resources of other people, even if just other curious people to bounce ideas off of.",1
176,Senku has the advantage of knowing about technology. all it took was Chromi seeing a gear for him to think of making a water wheel. he is a genious in his own right    Senku just happens to know enough to not accidentally kill himself with unknown chemicals,1
177,Imagine if the two of them had the benefit of a modern education. Senku might've ended up looking like a chump.,1
178,"Ehhhh, doubtful. Senku presumably has the full blueprint of modern human technology and science in his head. That's not something you can realistically have a grasp of at his age without being prodigious, if not superhumanly intelligent. The chemistry alone is impressive, but he's starting to engineer electronics, which is a different field entirely. It's one thing to know how to make this stuff, but to know how to make every individual component and material from the basic elements that exist in nature, with no modern manufacturing processes or facilities to help? That's next level.     Chrome definitely has high potential, though, and the drive to achieve advances in science. He would have had a bright future in a modern era.",1
179,"yeah, the best i could to is get metal forging going and a steam engine. maybe some crop rotation to improve agriculture.     but when you really think about it, like we saw with the katanas. having metal weapons and tools is so much better than stone that it might as well be magic.    there are actually some theories that legendary swords like Excalibur and such were actually just some of the first steel swords ever made before steel smithing became a common practice. a  steel sword compared to iron or bronze might as well be a gift from the gods.",1
180,"I don't think I could even get that far. Honestly, even the very first huts and lean-tos Senku creates are above my crafting ability. Primitive Technology videos have shown me that even stone age construction required a lot of knowhow and effort, and plenty of trial and error even when you know exactly what you're making.",1
181,"He probably would've.  If you think about it all Senku really has is a lot of knowledge from mass amounts of trial and error with better technology than they have.  Along with an education where he researched science as much as he could.    Wish I could find info that was half as explanatory as Dr.STONE is without being either incredibly long, boring or confusing.",0
182,"""all Senku really has""    What an incredibly dumb comment to tear down Senku. You seriously think someone could memorize immense amounts of scientific knowledge without immense intelligence? He needs to understand it all in order to memorize it. Which means he is by far the most intelligent person in world history, given the width of knowledge he has. Every step for making penicilline, every step for every other invention. I don't get how you think this is possible without the intelligence to equal the memory.",0
183,"Did you not read my entire comment or something?  Cause it seems like you think I was saying all Senku has is a bunch of memorized facts.    If you read my comment seriously I said he has the knowledge of all the trial and error he's done.  As well as an education where he was able to research science as much as he could.      Never once did I say anything to ""tear down"" Senku.  I clearly stated that had all that knowledge from the experiences he's down and the mass amount of research he's used.  The point was that comparing all of that to someone like Chrome who has the bare minimum he has heard from Senku.  Along with his experimentation into his ""sorcery"" he had done.  Is not an accurate comparison    As for your comment, understanding things doesn't require immense intelligence.  It requires the knowledge of how those things work.  Being ""smart"" is quite objective.  You don't need to be considered ""smart"" to understand things.      Knowing how something works means understanding it and if you can understand something you can replicate it.",1
184,Senku has absolutely perfect memory. Even if those two are more creative than him - he would still be smarter technically.,1
185,I would say that they're rough diamonds that Senku thoroughly polished until they could shine to their brightest potential. He set them on the path of science & gave them the understanding they needed to let their imaginations run wild.,1
186,"It's great and all, but am I the only one bothered by the cloud-like cotton candy ? I mean come on TMS, we could have at least something like that",1
187,Senku about to make the iPhone 3711,2
188,"and here I thought chrome was gonna find an old nokia, those would probably last about 4000 years",2
189,lmaoo facts them bricks are everything proof,2
190,I'd just like to let you know that I am very proud of myself for being able to understand your comment. It took me a while but I got there.,1
191,I bet his main aim was a nokia all along.    He did say that he was building the greatest human weapon in the last episode.,1
192,"You know what I bet still works? An old NES. Just blow the cartridge and, so long as you can produce the right kind of power source, you're good to go.",1
193,they will have to mine that 330 out of the mountain though,2
194,"Make a Nokia instead. If it doesn't knock people out when thrown, it might make them switch sides once they realize it's a phone and not a brick.",2
195,"Senku will just build a fortress around the village, made up of entirely Nokia phones. Good luck invading the village.",1
196,You mean the Stone Phone.,2
197,Poor Kokuyo. He was so certain that Kohaku would go against using the shield and she just instantly agrees and breaks his heart,1
198,"In Kohaku's defense, she's been given steel weapons that slice right through wood. She's more than bright enough to know that her wooden shield is simply obsolete. Also, it was for the current leader of the village and man she's crushing on.",0
199,"     Her sister crushed hard on him too, his harem-protagonist skill is leveling up!",0
200,Complete with the lack if interest-in-that-way in women.,0
201,Except Science-chan,2
202,"Don’t forget best girl, Sulfy-chan",1
203,Can't forget the blood relative! Not even that distant considering they are from a gene pool of like 6. Though if we start worrying about genetics 3000 years of inbreeding would probably be more concerning lol,1
204,"They are not even blood relatives, Senku is adopted and just uses the same hair dye as his father apparently. However even if the author would have kept him biological related they still wouldn't be related more than we two strangers on reddit are.",2
205,Poor Chrome.,0
206,"     Against katanas yes, but what about flint spears?",1
207,"If they can make swords, they can make crude steel shields.    I mean, the cheapest shield would basically be akin to a pot lid, and still be miles above a lacquered wooden shield in terms of strength and resilience to damage. And I'm assuming Kaneki is too proud to stop at anything short of a buckler, at the very least. Or perhaps a steel round shield?",0
208,     I'm fairly certain at this point there has been little to no hints even to Kohaku having particular feelings for Senku or anyone else. Unless my memory is failing. I do ship them hard tho,0
209,"""I think I like you"" when they first meet, to which Senku replies ""Ughh...""  and then later on, there's a very large declaration in the manga that hasn't been adapted yet. It's pretty clear.    I think it's more interesting to discuss why Senku hasn't at least responded to her feelings.    Reasons a and b: Science is Senku's Waifu and Dr. Stone is a Shounen title.    Reasons that I'd like to see touched on:    - Senku would prefer his ladies adhere to a little more modern hygiene. There are hints that he's introduced soap to the village, but nothing explicit.    - Kohaku's hair is horrific, compared to other female characters in the story. Again, likely a hygiene issue.    - Senku's gender preference simply hasn't been addressed one way or the other. It does get a nod in recent chapters of the Manga, but nothing concrete. It'd be neat to see a quietly, openly homosexual lead in a popular shonen title. I'm not sure Dr. Stone is going to be that title, but Senku would be a good candidate, IMO. He did drop his marriage to Ruri like a hot coal, but that may well be because he knew his good friend, Chrome, liked her.    Kohaku is a great character in that she represents the 'everyman' from the stone-age side of things the same way Taijuu is the modern-era 'everyman', learning that even though there are concepts and technologies she doesn't understand, that doesn't make them in any way magical.    We see a little of this in this ep, where she helps make the gear out of her own shield. It get more pronounced in later chapters of the manga.",1
210,"Wooden shields have been historically used to great effect against steel weaponry.    You can try it yourself, just get a soft wood plank from a DIY store and whack at it with a good knife and see what happens. And then keep in mind that the wood for a shield would be even more durable then that.",1
211,     Pffffft sorry but kohaku has not even a millimeter of romantic feelings for senku and probably never will,1
212,Gave me some serious Mordred from fate vibes for a second lol.,1
213,Nice translation there!     laughter,1
214,"anyone know the word they used in Japanese? Was it acually the Jap equivilant of ""meme"" or did the translators just take a bit of liberty with it?",1
215,The translation seemed very liberal indeed     slowgrin,2
216,What did they actually say?,2
217,They basically said exactly what's in the subtitles.,2
218,"What I don't get is that the west also has its ""straight man routine"". Did CR think their zoomer audience only knows memes?",1
219,I wouldn’t have gotten the straight man reference tbf     I thought it was a next great baker  iron chef joke,1
220,With all the food reactions I thought we were delving into parody jabbing Food Wars.,0
221,Actually that would make more sense since foodwars is another WSJ show,2
222,"I mean, I wouldn't have gotten why he seemed to upset about it.",0
223,idk what straight man is,1
224,It is one who does not appreciate Astolfo.,0
225,"The only sane person in an insane scenario basically. Their reaction to the idiocy & insanity happening around them mimics the thoughts of the audience & makes the best reactions. To use an example from this show itself: Gen. Gen, having lived in the modern age before being tossed into the world of sticks & stones, knows how fucking ridiculous the thought of creating cell phones with their incredibly limited resources is, & his reaction to the insanity becomes a joke in & of itself. Like remarking that the conversations IQ dropped when Senku said they needed a cotton candy machine.",0
226,Meditate a bit on the words and think about the context. What do you think a straight man is when talking about a comedy act?    You know what it is but you probably don't know what it's called.,1
227,It's not really a Western style of comedy in the first place... Western comedy from what I know is mostly just one person talking,1
228,There's much more than that. You're just talking about Stand-Up Comedy...,2
229,"Even if it's out there, surely it's rather niche? So it doesn't make sense to use a term that only few people would know",1
230,Changing the meaning of the whole joke isn't the way to go either...,1
231,"No, it's not niche in the slightest, it's a staple of comedy, you're just dumb for not knowing it.",0
232,Ok man we’re just in different circles of people. Few people watch comedy at all let alone a specific type. If anyone is watching comedy it’s either standup or a talk show,1
233,"What?    Most comedy that people watch is in movies, and it's an incredibly popular genre.    The straightman isn't some specific routine. It's literally just someone in a comedy who acts completely calm and normal when faced with insane events or characters. It's super common.",1
234,"Sure but hardly anyone I know would associate that comedy format with the specific term ""straight man"". Pretty sure when most people hear ""straight man"" they will think of a heterosexual guy, hence why they didn't translate it like that. I mean I myself am very familiar with nori-tsukkomi and straight up heard the actors say it. Best thing they can do imo is just straight up translate it as ""nori-tsukkomi"" and then have a translator note or something",1
235,"     When devoid of context, yes, but in the context of specifically talking about a comedy routine like in the show it is very obvious.         Idk why, I've literally never thought it was a rare term to know. Much more common that tsundere.",1
236,I'm not a straight man  ,0
237,"Memes makes more sense in that context, if they had said ""straight man"" most people would have probably had to stop and think about it for a moment to understand what he said, whereas with meme you instantly get the meaning of the exchange.",0
238,"Really? I thought ""meme"" made little sense in that context.           ""Straight-man"" is a common form of acted comedy; I don't know what part of their act was a meme.",1
239,"I guess meme isn't the best way to describe their act, it's not like they were imitating jotaro and dio walking towards each other, but in terms of some weird comedy terminology that has no business being known in the stone age it makes sense.",0
240,"And why does that make the term meme any more sense than straight man? The modern defined form of meme is unlikely to exist in a world without mass communication, while a standard form of comedy would exist as long as someone wants to be a comedian.          The last argument holds little water simply because the foundation of the village was formed by a man of modern times.",1
241,"That's.... Why it makes more sense. Because it make no sense for meme to still be a used term, but Senku's dad kept it alive in the 100 tales. That's the joke",1
242,"But it isn't the actual joke. The joke is that even our foundations of comedy has survived in a small village for thousands of years.          I'm arguing that the translators went too far with their ""localization.""            The point of localization is to translate an alien concept into the equivalent of the recipient culture's.          Straight man exists in both Asian and Western comedy, so no localization was needed.          ""Meme"" is not an equivalent to ""straight man.""",1
243,"At least it ain't ""Jelly Donut"" levels of hilariously bad translation.",0
244,"Eh, honestly, their use of that style was close enough to a meme for me, and while straight man may exist in western comedy, it's definitely a less used term. I think meme works fine and you're honestly just being overly picky about it. Is it a direct translation, no, but the joke comes through fine as meme.",1
245,"Yeah, probably am.",1
246,An example: Sinpachi from Gintama,2
247,Kazuma from Konosuba as well.,1
248,"Fixed what exactly? It was Ginro who said the word ""nori-tsukkomi"" first though?",2
249,I stand corrected. Sorry.,0
250,"Ah, thank you for this, I was trying to figure out what that was supposed to mean and my electronic dictionary was doing me no favors.    One of my Japanese friends informed me yesterday that another exchange friend of hers was educating her on 'meme culture,' and I'm fairly certain she is one of only a handful of Japenese citizens who have any comprehension of the term.",1
251,"They said ""nori-tsukkomi"" in Japanese. Here you go.",2
252,"Ah that makes more sense. I thought that ""meme"" didnt really work in the context.",2
253,"""Skit"" or ""Comedy Sketch"" would make more sense since those would both be equally strange words.",1
254,"No one really got it right so far.          It's specifically a comedic routine of agreeing with whatever silly premise you were presented with, then going ""no, wtf is wrong with you?"" after a delay.",0
255,"So they were memeing. I don't see the problem with this, given there's not a word for the meme labeled 'noritsukkomi' in english other than 'being the straight man' which honestly didn't carry home the idea behind the fact that it could be passed down.",1
256,"Japanese abbreviation is actually JPN! ""Jap"" is a derogatory term in the United States that came after the events of the Japanese Internments.",1
257,SJW alert,1
258,Thank you PC Principal,1
259,The animation of the gears moving looks really cool in my opinion,1
260,10 billion bonus points for not being bad CG.,1
261,Very refreshing to see. Dr. Stone keeps impressing me more with every episode.,1
262,I actually had to go back and look at the animation. It's definitely CG.,1
263,"If you can immediately tell it's CG, it's bad CG. So this is pretty good CG!",1
264,But not  bad  CG. You had to go back to check; it didn't jump out at you.,1
265,"Yeah it was used appropriately, and it was only on screen for a few seconds at a time",1
266,"Seeing how Dr. Stone has been using CG is pretty exciting, honestly. If it makes work easier for the animators and it looks nice it's a win-win for everyone",1
267,"I'm still not sure what happened to this shot though. I think the flat textures were supposed to be modeled onto a gear, but instead are just left there moving sideways and updown like treadmills.",1
268,Those are two cone shaped gears.,2
269,Oooooooh I see it now. Lmao what a weird perspective trick that did on me.,1
270,The gears themselves weren't bad but everyone spinning the gears was horrible cg.,0
271,That feeling when you're surrounded by both crazy geniuses and a bunch of idiots at the same time,0
272,"Yay! New template, guys!",1
273,"I like how when they were explaining how hard it would be to get everything done Kohaku was just saying normal shonen stuff, like the bond between brothers and the power of will.",1
274,Senku's dad really had a lot of questionable choices of what went into the 100 tales,0
275,half of them were just a summary of one piece,2
276,"Not even the enemy can resist the power of science.    In the end science will win, what makes life good is the simple things that are trivial to us nowdays, but would be truly a gift of gods in a stone world, such as cotton candy, coke or katana swords.  What `s the point of  having all the sex and debauchery you want in a stone world when i can't play Pokémon on my NS and become the very best?",1
277,Seriously though one of the most unrealistic parts of this show is that literally everyone Tsukasa sends after Senku do not instantly defect as soon as they see gunpowder and metallurgy and shit.     Hell the fact that the guy knows how to make soda alone could probably get fuck tons of people on his side when the other option is boiled water and shitty wine.,0
278,"Maybe it's because if you do, theres a good chance that Kars Bucciarati and his gang of Fist of the North Star goons will beat you to death.",2
279,They will defect as soon as Senku invents protein shakes and synthol.,0
280,"I don't think Senku would bother with synthol, he's only after things that have a real purpose.",0
281,"Synthehol, Worf only drinks blood wine.  Bring me more blood wine.",2
282,Or telling them that they have antibiotics. I would not want to live without the safety net of proper medicine.,0
283,"Tsukasa Empire has a Dysentery outbreak, meanwhile in Science Land you get to eat candy and drink Cola    The choice is clear to me.",1
284,They might have been Americans. Our medical system is basically a net that captures indentured servants.,2
285,"""The Kingdom of Science has antibiotics?  But have they invented medical debt yet???""",0
286,"In a way, senku started with debt as soon as he gave people ramen and then guilt tripped them into working for him as payment.",0
287,"I agreed, even without cola and phones, just having antibiotic will be my reason for deflecting.     Tsukasa Empire would have high mortality rate once winter has arrived, given that i doubt they be able to start a fire and it be freezing which animal fur might help but it aint gonna eliminate death from the weaker ones.",2
288,"Except almost all of them haven't seen everything, and those that have are either too dumb to understand or seem to be too invested in Tsukasas POV.  If the entirety of Tsukasa's empire saw it and were shown that Senku could stop Tsukasa killing them for defecting then yea, they'd all defect.  Personally, I'd pick the science side in a heartbeat but it seems Tsukasa is also not allowing the people in the camp to know about Senku too much, possibly to stop that exact issue.",0
289,If they had seen the noodle cart I bet youd be right.,2
290,"What if the plan was to make as many luxurious inventions as possible and break into Tsukasa's camp to show them off to everyone there, before leaving Tsukasa and the few people still stupid enough to not defect to be torn apart by everyone else who wants to?",0
291,     Yeah it's totally not how much knowledge senku has    Or how the village isn't filled with diseases that should have developed in 3700s for everyone      Or how strong Tsukahasa hyouga and Taiju are      It's definitely that the bad guys are bad guys,1
292,"Especially against people who have experienced the old world, it reminds them what they would lose out if they keep following tsukasa's ideology.",0
293,does  tsukasa camp mention about deauchery ?,2
294,"When we first meet Gen, he mentions harem and all the girls you can get but food is simple. I doubt it's that bad by the look of it we got last episode. Though honestly, if something simmilar were to happen in real world I would bet on debauchery 100%, like getting some revival fluid and hauling the stone girl of your pick to your cell, simple reign of the strong all the way, unless a superhuman with decent modern day basic human decency moralsin some ways at least was in charge.",1
295,"     Tsukasa is surprisingly OK with rape, apparently?    It's funny that his ""pure, untainted utopia for the young"" doesn't even pass the most cursory of morality checks.",1
296,Wait huh? Did you read my comment correctly? I just wanted to express that having a Jojo like Tsukasa with decent moral compass bar the culling ideology as the leader is the only thing that prevents rape and depravity in his camp. that and the shonen jump,0
297,First week when NNN ends,2
298,MRW my girlfriend reminds me it's december 1st,2
299,Not only was that relatable he literally says haul ass. 1010.,0
300,Damn this episode was full of meme templates.,0
301,You even know the word meme?,2
302,Did Chrome turn into Senku's dad?,2
303,"Senku motherfucking done it, he managed to accelerate 1,982,000 years of human history in a single fucking year and managed to make a fucking power plant in a fucking stone world. This episode shows that  human knowlodge is the most important achiviement of human history, it doesnt matter how much humanity has advanced, if the apocalypse happens, with knowlodge we would be able to get back to civilization, but with knowlodge lost, all of that would be forever lost.",0
304,"     Chrome built that waterwheel without knowing what it is.  Crazy people like chrome will always rebuild human technology eventually, as long as humans exist.  Humans right now are advancing into new technology every day.",2
305,He saw a gear though,2
306,and its a goddamn anime. without the prior knowledge coming from senku it'd be hard for him to think of that anyways I think. and its a goddamn anime!,0
307,"I don't really think so. He saw how it works and heard that going slow is enough. He then wanted to do it easier and remembered that river is flowing without help. Everything else is doable with some logic and putting down different gears to place to get it where you want.    Sure, not everyone would think about putting it on river, but if he gets an idea about that, then everything else is fairly easy.",1
308,"""what if I put in 15 teeth instead of 5 teeth? How big can this gear get? What happens if i combine different sizes?""    I won't be surprised if they start building bicycles soon. Fast and efficient mode of transportation.",1
309,"I am actually surprised that senku had not gotten a waterwheel up and running earlier. I just though that they were not that close to moving water, but as it was seemingly down the path, why wait so long?",1
310,Because he had manpower and was focusing on the main issue rather than trying to automate things.,2
311,"Absolute blasphemy, automation is sexy",1
312,Can't disagree but making automation requires a foundation to base it off if.,1
313,"He actually had, that's what they used to make the carbonated water for the antibiotic and the cola, albeit on a much smaller scale. It's possible it hadn't occurred to him yet that a water wheel of that size was possible now, Senku doesn't always think of everything, I mean he never thought to ask the name of the village.",2
314,Another way Senku proves to be a scientist not an Engineer I believe.,2
315,"yeah, thought that as well tbh, but theyre skipping a lot of things that we'd think of as fundamental. just skipping straight to phones like wha?",1
316,"Indeed, but so did anyone putting two wheels together and noticing they moved at different speeds. Chrome worked out that A the river would turn a wheel which is quite the leap considering he hasn't been shown a paddle or anything like that and that B he could turn linear motion into circular motion and C and this is the big one that that could be applied to many purposes. Sure, he got shown one potential use, but one which has already been solved by having Kinro up there turning the wheel. To even make the thing, he must have conceived of  other uses for it. He only got introduced to the concept of flour a few weeks ago, but he's already gone from the earliest flour 6000 BCE to the earliest water wheels 400 BCE in that time, all by being shown two wheels moving together. 5400 years of people didn't make this connection, but he did.     Chrome's a bloody genius.",1
317,"Right, so he got a jump start, but people would get there eventually reguardless.",2
318,And Kaseki is no fucking joke he may be far fetched as fuck but ideas can't be created without a talented craftsman. He's no ordinary craftsman either moreso some fantasy super hero in the field.,1
319,"Yup, it seems he has the super power to make anything instead of bring heavily specialized.",1
320,"The whole show at this point is ""what if god-tier humans were put back into the stone age."" I'm not complaining though; it wouldn't be very fun if you put an average high schooler in the same spot lol",1
321,I wouldn't watch a whole episode of nothing but an average highschooler fumbling about what to do next so yeah.,1
322,"Essentially that's the idea.    Senku was focused on obtaining the materials needed for the phone, produced one thing and Chrome just went wild and used it for something completely different. Which is 100% of technological improvment work in real life.    The whole point of the patent system is protecting the right to cash on an invention in order to encourage the inventor to make the design and scientifical principle behind it public, so that people can learn from it, develop new things and yadayada rather than mantaining it secret to avoid being copied.As they say, nothing is original in this world and we humans are simply really good at developing new ideas from things we saw previously not even the guy who invented the wheel probably thought about it, he simply applied something he had seen.    I KNOW that there is no single guy who invented the wheel, it's a manner of speech.    Some people have the weird impression is the solution to every problem mankind, while it is not. Science it's just a method to understand the principles of nature through observation, tests and trials and reapplying those discoveries in another context, leading to something new that will just keep sparking new discoveries and so on.     Science is, at hearth, the simple result of humans trying to understand the things going on around them and using them to their own advantage. Science isn't an opposite force to Nature as some fiction like to use, science is just the human usage of Nature for themselves.",1
323,       What is?,2
324,"Science, but I can't fucking write.",2
325,He saw a gear which senku made so no,0
326,"It wasn't all Senku, give some credit to Chrome and Kaseki.",1

329,reminds me of One for All quirk,2
330,"      Not  forever - that's part of this show's message. Even if Senku had never came along, you will always have weirdos who will collect weird rocks and try to figure out what you can use them for. Chrome is the representation of the fact that Science is Inevitable. Senku is just the shortcut.",0
331,"Tbh, the water wheel power plant has always been my go to Zombie Apocalypse plan. I live in an area with a lot of water so...but yeah, senku's is probably 10 billion times better than what id end up actually making save some excellent salvage and not starting from complete scratch.",1
332,Hence why writing is so important. It allows one to pass down knowledge for others to advance it.,1
333,"     Which is why I find it odd that SIX FUCKING ASTRONAUTS couldn’t assemble some sort of technology when they already had some working stuff to use we clearly see that electric grids and the internet were working when they used live streams to see how everyone was petrified. As feels as the Senku’s father story was, it has so far been the most immersion breaking thing of this show. Between them apparently just ignoring all the clearly still working technology and the fact that six people would a not be genetically diverse enough to survive more than a few generations and b even if they were should have expanded to more than  40-50 people after 3700 years.     I realize I’m nitpicking a show where people could be petrified for 3700 years and some kid could count seconds for that long but still. Considering all the other great realistic looks at technology in a “Stone Age,” I find it odd that the author overlooked that stuff. When we first saw the village, I assumed they were the descendants of some people who had woken up naturally like Senku. Maybe one or two generations. Not the offspring of exactly three couples from the full 3700 years ago.",1
334,That's why they had them land on a Island clearly with very little tech probably quite poor fishermen farmers. And then killed them all off so fast.     I anime only but I'm assuming a ton more villages will show up at some point or I will loss immersion as well. Big hint to other villages or nomadic tribes. This village is set up to defend it's self if there were no other villages they have no defense.,0
335,"They did make a point of that but clearly they ended up somewhere fairly close to where Senku was. While petrified, Senku’s body clearly moved, but I doubt the erosion and natural processes would move him that far, especially considering he couldn’t move between landmasses as I’d imagine petrified people would sink. Then, once awake, he makes that journey before he is “killed” but iirc it’s only a day or two at most. And from there he wasn’t far from the village.     All of this leads me to believe the village is on the same landmass as Senku’s school and the landmark Senku and co find during that first arc. I could excuse it as the clan moving after the astronaut’s deaths but then Senku visits the graveyard and his father’s grave is implied to be there.     I liked the twist of having the astronauts not being on Earth during the green blast but I feel like it opens a big can of worms. Like the author wanted a few cool plot threads but didn’t fully think through all the ramifications. Still an enjoyable show though, just a minor oversight imo. Unless maybe they explain some of this later on",1
336,That shot with the power plant was amazing maaaaan,1
337,And I thank all those who archive and all the projects centered around protecting knowledge if an apocalypse happened.,1
338,"I love how civilization fall media often miss that. Especially in Governmental Functioning which almost all of it was figured out before Railroads.     Got a big laugh when someone watching Full Metal Alchemist say how are they tracking that guy down so fast before computers.     Dragnet was a 60's TV show we worked out how to do a Dragnet way way before Computers. A very organized search system. Often took rooms full of people but what you could call extremely tight coding allowed way more to be done than people think they could then.     Rail Roads in 1800's were running hundred of very mechanically complex and maintenance intensive Engines with thousands of different types of train cars, keeping that, track in repair and fuel managed well enough that the 10:05 Passenger Train arrived at 10:05 almost always. And of course if it left at 10:20 you better be on it as it was leaving on the dot.     A lot of the hard stuff as far as running things was figured out way way before you might think it was. For some reason Container Shipping not invented till 1950's and I think you probably could use the same system with way smaller boxes with Wagons and Sailing ships designed for the boxes as they did have mechanical lifting devices like the Derrick.     Look up how Derrick was invented by executioner of that name to hang folks better and that's his last name. Loved learning that from anime ""Horizon in Middle of Nowhere.  Give that one 5 or 6 episodes before it takes off like a rocket in action",1
339,"To be honest, I think the most astonishing part of humans and knowledge is that our brain power essentially hasn't changed at all in the last several thousands of years. This show really proves that knowledge of how the world works is all you need to create a modern world. Like if you took a caveman from 13,000 years ago and raised him today, you wouldn't even be able to tell the difference",1
340,I love that Chrome is coming up with his own inventions now even though he didn't realize it'd already been discovered thousands of years before. It's nice to see him not just sitting back and doing only what Senku wants but taking the liberty to help in his own way too.     Side note: I want to taste cotton candy that gives me the same reaction of all of them lmao,1
341,     Jus sit in a cave living of fruit & grilled fish for 50 odd years then having some cotton-candy like that should give a similar reaction.,1
342,Dang you right. Time to go find a cave.,2
343,Like December 1 if you make it all the way through November.,1
344,"Also I would like to think, that the fruit they have aren't as sweet as the fruits we have today. Since the engineered fruits probably went extinct and they only got wild fruits.    And the fruits in our stone age where supposedly also not sweet, a reason why their teeth didn't rot without proper care like we need today.",0
345,     Roman era is already quite late; dentistry dates back to Ancient Egypt for that matter. But if we're talking the Stone Age I don't think cavities were a widespread problem at all.,0
346,"I feel like people often overlook the fact that food tasted like shit for most of human history. When people hear of all the death and conquering that people did just for spices to improve their food, they think its weird or barbaric, but nobody actually realized just how important decent tasting food was for them.    That's why it wasn't at all hard to believe that Senku's main method of gaining power was food bribes",1
347,"For a second, I thought I was watching Food Wars :P",0
348,"Could have easily been the superior food show, Restaurant to Another Universe.",1
349,"Can't take anything away from him for it being invented before. Even if you're shown the idea of two wheels moving against eachother which would be how gearing got discovered, it still takes quite the leap to put it together with water movement to produce power.",2
350,Oh I wasn’t trying to take anything away from him especially since he didn’t know anything about it. I only added it in parentheses because I figured someone would comment being smart about him technically not inventing it first haha. I love that it’s showing Chrome is just as capable at also coming up with ideas to improve the kingdom of science though and can’t wait to see what other things he invents!!,1
351,I simply loved that he made it for the purpose of nonstop cotton candy.,1
352,"Though I felt bad for the poor guy when Senku revealed he had not, in fact, been the first human being in history to think of using a paddle wheel to harness hydroelectric power XD. He deserved to be though.",0
353,It's kind of amazing to me how Dr. Stone just seems to top itself every single episode. IMO Dr. Stone is one of the top anime of the year.,1
354,2019 is a good year for anime,1
355,"What other shows would you recommend, I've watched this and Kimetsu no Yaiba so far.",1
356,Mob Psycho 100 II came out this year too. You should definitely check it out if you haven't.,1
357,The Promised Neverland came out this year,1
358,"Whoa, that felt like last year!",1
359,"beastars, Mob psycho, The promised neverland, Vinland sagai havent started tihs one just heard its amazing, Attack on titan, my hero aca    there is also given, not everyone's cup of tea because its a BL show    also jojos part 5 and run with the wind that continued from last year    those are my top picks this year, to put into comparison, last year i had 2 shows to this level that i didnt mention in the continuing listplanet witha place further than the universe      personally i think beastars is my pick for AotY out of that, but any of them as your AotY are obviously a decent pick",1
360,"Start Vinland Saga. If you start quick and binge, you'll catch up by the time or soon after the upcoming episode, which seems like it'll be a banger. Amazon also made it available for free as I saw in a post on ranime earlier though it may depend on where you live, now's an amazing time to pick up the show.",1
361,I plan to do it when it’s complete like I did with made in abyss I feel like it will be easier to get through,1
362,ay that's nice but I think you'll enjoy the sheer hype that some of these final episodes will bring too. Hype's always better when you watch it as it's releasing.,1
363,Youjo Senki movie,2
364, attack on titan and jojo,0
365,Everyone skipped Sarazanmai and it's driving me crazy. If not for Dr. Stone and potentially Babylon I'd easily call it as AOTY.,2
366,"You could try out ""Fire Force"", that was the other big one that's currently running.  Also ""Ascendance of a Bookworm"" is somewhat similar Dr. Stone it focuses on paper production.  If your into space battles ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes"" is a good pick.",1
367,Man 2019 was the year of the dragon's asshole,2
368,wait what did i miss,0
369,Arifureta,2
370, cries in Arifureta ,0
371,"It really is crazy good. When it started out I was counting on Vinland Saga and Enen no Shouboutai to be better, but holy shit did Dr. Stone leave everything else behind. It doesn't stop getting better.",1
372,"I dropped Fire Force, idk what happened but it just became a slog to watch.",0
373,"Fire Force is not good if you watch anime first. Manga is absolutely relentless. Anime slows things down, probably due to the fact that this is the adaptation but they added a lot of stuff or presented it in a very inventive way.",0
374,"I personally was expecting a more serious tone to it given the first couple of episodes and the theme in general, so the funny questionably timed bits are what turn me off. Still watching though, it's alright.",1
375,Yeah that might be it honestly. The constant shift in tone is pretty jarring. One of the big ones for me was when they decided to strip cat girl while he was fighting the guy in the factory.,1
376,"that felt all kinds of wrong, the last episode ended with her being beaten black and blue by someone she trusted in something that felt analogous to freaking domestic abuse. but then the series falls back from that to be all like ""Look! titties!""  that's when I dropped the show as well,  I don't dislike fanservice but when you're actively sabotaging serious moments for it it can fuck off.",1
377,"Definitely felt weird. And everyone just says ""dude did you not watch the episode, her special power is getting into those situations so it's fine"". No, it's not fine. You can't make a shit character and say it's okay because being a shit character is their special power.",1
378,"     I mean, it works for SAO.......",2
379,"Yeah I dropped it because of that. The ending of the episode right before that was so fucking solid, but they had to fuck up in the next episode.",0
380,I feel there is a right and wrong way to blend comedic and serious moments and while I'm enjoying Fire Force I feel that it fails to do that.,0
381,I'm considering dropping it too since I started reading the manga and noticed they've changed a bunch if stuff.,2
382,"Yeah, I dropped it as well. I was already pretty close after the whole cat girl thing in the factory... but it really just kind of slowed down a lot. Some decent characters but it's really hindered by pacing issues.",1
383,Same stop watching after the Kyoani fire.,0
384,"I think it's because the plotconspiracy element became an intrusive problem which ended up derailing everything good about the show characters, premise.    I've actually been working on a script for a video about it for like 3 weeks. I need to hurry or the damn show will end before I make it.",2
385,"Dr Stone is one of those series that just gets better every episode. I feel it has a pretty weak start and just keeps building on its premise more and more. All the side characters are really likeable and they all grow a bit each time, too.",1
386,"The best thing is that S2 will blow this season out of the fucking world. Like if you guys are hyped about things happening now, you just wait..",1
387,"This has been just a great year for anime I'm general, really. Promised Neverland, Dr. STONE, Kimetsu no Yaiba, the Konosuba movie, Blackfox, Cautious Hero, etc. I REALLY hope that the industry keeps topping itself again in 2020.",1
388,That's the power of a well executed story. Great character interaction and knowledge of how to convey information and reach certain beats in the story.    Some anime are such a damn mess that Dr. Stone simply feels like it's in another media entirely.,1
389,THE STONE WORLD HAS MEMES    THIS IS NOT A DRILL    THE STONE WORLD HAS MEMES    SHARE THEM WITH US YOU FUCKS,0
390,"Setting the fact that ""meme"" isn't quite the appropriate translation aside, the origin of the ""internet memes"" is very rooted in early days of the japanese side of the internet.    I always forget if it was 2ch or futaba, but those sites were very popular for the time and they ended up naturally cultivating the type of internet culture you'd get from a place like that. and by place like that I mean the wild west or in this case east of the internet, think golden age 4chan where people just pump out the weirdest shit just because they have literally nothing better to do with themselves    Eventually 4chan was founded in the image of 2chfutaba, and I assume you know how much effect 4chan had on the web.",2
391, If a boomer stumbled on this thread... ,2
392,"Nah the boomers are actually relatively tech-savvy, at least the ones I know. But their parents would definitely be lost.",1
393,How young exactly are the baby boomers you know?,2
394,"My aunts and uncles... lol. You do realize that the boomers were a large portion of the people ON the original internet, right?",1
395,"No, they weren't. Boomers were too busy thinking the internet was a fad while watching their prime time TV.    The internet was populated by millenials and gen x.",0
396,"Do you realize that the Baby Boomers are those born between 1946 and 196465, right? Which means that their parents were those who fought in WW2?",0
397,"Yeah, which would be my grandparents.",1
398,"And don't tell that 65-to-75yo people are adept at using PCs because I risk going mad all the time due to 4050yo people incapable of properly using a smartphone, let alone using properly a PC outside of basic Microsoft things.    Obviously someone will know the tech even above 70 Someone MUST have used it back in the days before being as we know the computer know lol but definitely this ain't the majority.",1
399,"It varies a lot. And us at tail of Baby Boomer are more into computers somewhat. I was using computers in 78 learned Basic and then DOS, was not a expert but I learned enough it's easy to figure out modern stuff which is tons easier to figure out than early stuff.     Big difference is probably those from a math and science background and the general public. Even the pre desktop Slide Rules types adapted fairly fast. My Father was on main frames in 50's and 60's but his ""General Electric"" plant actually made Nuclear Bomb Triggers the real hard part so my experience not typical Boomer. Did not give me details from work though learned what they actually did from local paper.     There is a stop listening to new music effect. Majority stall out on music and often technology although all can master basic cell phone.    Me I love new music and stay up with new tech. But once you know how programing works and other basic science things you just look it up. The biggest difference is little kids pick up stuff in minutes I would have to take a hour plus to figure on sometimes.    So you younger folk do have a speed advantage. But us getting primitive computers to work often can figure out things just like young folk who actually are in the field.     Still Amazing how much we got done with so tiny memory space. Modern Programing often is massive bloat ware because they never had to learn to make the code tight.     Mother Nature still has us beat on running on no memory or speed, that in example one form of Ant they think has only 20 lines of code that totally allow it to function fully. But she had Billion plus years of trial and error to do that.",1
400,"Yeah, technology like personal computers and such started to become a thing around the time they grew up, so they do tend to be pretty familiar with modern tech. They do have the occasional weirdo who seems to have lived under a rock for the last 100 years, but the majority of them are about as good at using technology as everyone else.",1
401,"Did they motherfucking translate ""forced me to play the straight man"" as ""made me go along with a meme""?    Jesus man",0
402,I don't understand why so many of the official subs are like this. They take way too many liberties.,1
403,"If I had to guess they probably don't have much in terms of guidelines, really busy schedules to get subs out as fast as possible and nobody proofreadingoffering guidance.    Crunchyroll script are notorious for seemingly not even having a proofreader at times so its probably something along those lines.",0
404,"I don't know, I often get the feeling they're going out of their way to not be 100% accurate. I mean, you have Dororo clearly calling Hyakkimaru ""aniki"" and what do the subs say? ""Hyakkimaru"" instead of ""brother"". This is just an example but they do something like that all the time and wouldn't it be quicker to just translate it as it is instead of coming up with shit?",0
405,"There is a balance between what translators call ""liberal"" and ""literal"" translation, if something is too close to the original language it can be quite jarring in the language that it is being translated in. In English we don't use honorifics really, so saying ""hey name brother"" or ""hey brother name"" isn't a sentence that we will really hear in English, they could have just translated it as ""Hey brother"" substituting his name, but that would be similarly as weird. I can definitely see the argument for the inclusion of honorifics, even -san-senpai-kun or whatever, particularly when a character refers to another as just ""senpai"" - you're not going to translate that as ""upperclassman"" or just use their name though some do.    I have a bigger problems with just bad translationgrammatical errors and in this specific instance, conflating a style of japanese comedy with meme, like jesus christ.",0
406,"Which is why I support leaving the honorifics there, i.e: the subs should keep things like ""Senku-chan"" as we see here.",1
407,"I'm pretty insistent honorifics be left in for manga, but with anime, I can  hear  the honorifics. I don't mind if they leave it out of the text. And it's kind of fun when even I can recognize when the translator departed from the original material, what with my very limited knowledge of the language.    As far as honorifics in place of a name, I prefer if they just leave it untranslated. Just call Aniki Aniki; don't translate that to ""bro"" or whatever unless it's  really  appropriate to the character. Same thing with things like Sempai; ""senior"" means a few things in English, and NONE of them really capture the meaning of ""Sempai"" in most contexts.",1
408,"He wasn't calling him ""Hyakkimaru-aniki"" just ""aniki"". It's not weird to call the boss of your group ""big bro"" or something, and even if it was unusual, it's a series set in a feudal era japan like world, some cultural quirks are expected. Absolutely nobody watching would be surprised or confused. Reading a character's name which hasn't been pronounced is definitely much more distracting to everyone.",1
409,"Part of watching subbed anime is seeing these expressions like honorifics too and learning a little bit about the languageculture. Removing those completely negates that aspect, and I really dislike the adaptation to english terms in subtitles.",1
410,"They translated it as ""bro"" most of the time. In fact he said Bro so often that it felt out of place.",2
411,Fan translations back in the day were way better than the official subs are nowadays in my opinion. I also miss translator's notes even if they may have been a bit excessive at times.,1
412,"This is why I think Hidive subs are great. They actually leave TL notes with their translations. A recent example would be their subs for Joshikousei no Mudazukai, since that show had lots of Japanese-centric jokes. Now if only their player wasn't so awful.",1
413,TL note:    keikaku means plan.,2
414,I love when TL notes explain a cultural reference,1
415,"TL notes weren't needed here though, unless you want ""keikaku means plan"" level translations. He was just saying that he was made to play the straight man. Perfectly understandable english translation.",1
416,"I like the artistic liberties they took better. It's more relevant to today's culture than likening the events to a comedy routine, even if it's more accurate. Also, I just like to imagine Byakuya being such a shitlord that he thinks the word ""meme"" needed to be preserved for future generations of trolls & memelords.",1
417,"     That's nice and all, but it doesn't excuse the fact that the translation was  wrong .    A translator's job is to accurately convert the data presented from language A from language B. I'll forgive with major objections a tiny amount of localization for things that have no equivalent at all like super niche cultural sayings, but when you're changing the meaning or injecting new ideas in the work, you're absolutely failing to do the job of   translating   the work.",2
418,"The translators job is to accurately portray the scene in a way that an audience can understand, like changing Sakura's name to ""Lilly"" in the dub of Kino's Journey 2003, or in Tejina Senpai when they translated the joke of gyaru brocon almost saying ""pussy"" by changing the line from being mangomanko, to pushypussy. They don't need to directly translate it. They need to translate it in a way where western audiences can get the joke regardless of whether they know the Japanese pun.",1
419,"You have a very skewed understanding of translation, it seems.    I don't think I'll ever understand people who think loss of accuracy is acceptable in information transfer. Better a slower rate of transfer with high accuracy then a quick transfer with significant data loss.",1
420,"I don't think I'll ever understand people who think that literal translations that require editors notes is God-tier translation worthy of entry into the halls of Valhalla. Everyone knows what a meme in, but when someone pointed out that it should have been ""straight-man"" there were tons of ""what's a 'straight-man?'"" Comments",1
421,"Top marks for missing the point, mate.    I'm honestly always confused why so many people seem to think that having to look up an unfamiliar concept they encounter in fiction is some sort of objective negative. Is it just an aversion to learning new things?     Like, you give off this feeling of someone who is actively offended by the idea of punching ""define straight man comedy"" into a search engine. Like you'd rather have jelly donuts instead of onigiri.    I know I appreciate learning something new, and doubly so when it's my entertainment that makes me search out and internalize new information, since that increases the odds of me retaining it. Most of my cultural knowledge of Japan comes from seeing something weird in anime or manga and looking it up.",1
422,"Onigiri to jelly donuts was fucking stupid, so what I would do? ""Rice balls. My favorite."" It gets the point across without making you go ""wait, what?"" The point is to make it understandable to the target audience. ""Jelly donuts""? Stupid ""onigiri""? Requires an editors note. ""Rice balls""? Completely perfect middle ground.",0
423,"And you think people who don't already know what onigiri are wouldn't have to stop and say ""wait, rice balls? What?"" and have to look it up?",1
424,"No, I don't, because ""Rice ball"" is the most self explanatory food that one could possibly think of. A rice ball is a ball... Of rice. A literal 3 year old could figure out that ""Rice ball""=""ball of rice"" because of how simple & easy the term is.",1
425,"It really shows your understanding of what onigiri are if all you can think of is ""ball of rice"". Did you know rice balls are different food items in Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Italian cuisines? Prepared differently, with different fillers? Sometimes even fried?    No, it sounds like unfortunately you don't. Well, maybe this will inspire you to look it up. It's really quite interesting.    Getting back on topic, you're positing a hypothetical audience that is both multicultural and intelligent enough to understand exactly what a rice ball is in terms of food, but simultaneously both ignorant of what a straight man is in comedy and unwilling to spend the five seconds necessary to look it up and learn something new?    That's a really small group of people. Would you argue a similar approach to, say, Science Fiction, where you can replace every usage of scientific terms with carrot metaphors because people might have to look up what gluons are, and that's just not a quick and snappy, easily digestible way to convey information?",1
426,"I understand that Onigiri is prepared in different ways. ""Rice balls"" is simply close enough to get the point across without needing a thorough explanation. Why would one have to be multicultural or really smart to understand that a ""Rice ball"" is a ball of rice? What part of that is not remarkably simple? It's the same here. Meme is much more simple & gets the same point across, plus, people in this very comment section have proved that ""meme"" is more common & well understood than ""straight-man""",1
427,"In favor of the carrot metaphors, I see.    Well, alright then. Thanks for the conversation. Later, mate.",1
428,Go to VRV. It has HiDive and Crunchyroll combined. And uses a better player,1
429,What I really miss is sing-along subtitles for OPs and EDs.,0
430,"Absolutely. I watched the fansub of Shingeki and it was so good that I was actually disappointed when I got the Blu-Ray later on, which had vastly inferior subs and even typos, which is just embarrassing.",0
431,You realize that there is a BD release with the fansub subs right?,2
432,How else would I know that keikaku means plan?!,2
433,"There were a lot of stellar fansubs back in the 2000s, but people tend to forget just how fucking awful   they could get.    There were a lot of god awful fansubs back then, they've just faded into obscurity while we only remember the good ones.",0
434,"This is exactly the reason why I didn't watch the official Kaguya releases, and instead waited until the fansubs were out, even though they took  months  until they released the final episode.     That's how bad official subs were for me .",0
435,Remember when the official translation utterly ruined the penis episode?,0
436,"Nope, because I didn't watch the official release as mentioned before.",2
437,I envy you.,0
438,Oh believe me I had to wait  MONTHS  for each episode because they sure as hell took their sweet time. the were done with the last episode around the 19th of freaking June.,0
439,Yeah after that incident I've waited for that delayed fansub too. It was worth it.,1
440,"That's because they're  fan  subs. Made by fans. Of course fans would put in effort to a series they decided to translate on their free time, vs a paid translator who needs to get the job done as fast as possible.",1
441,Fan translation just made 90% of shounen protagonists respond with the F bomb to most villains every sentence.,1
442,"Because fansubs put time and effort into it due to their passion for the project.    But here, crunchyroll is hiring translators to just get it done as fast as possible so they can ship it out.",1
443,"This translation was still perfect, if not funnier because then no matter what background you can interpret that bit as whatever meme you’re familiar with     I thought Gen taking about balance of flavor was an iron chef  great bake-off reference",1
444,The layman might not understand what straight-man means but meme is pretty global in 2019.,1
445,"God forbid a person might actually learn a new word by watching anime, right?",0
446,that's not what translations are for.,2
447,People don't know what a straight man is? It's a basic comedy term.,1
448,But not everyone is a comedian.,0
449,You don't need to be a comedian to know basic comedy terms.     Just like you don't need to be a construction worker to know what foundation or framing is.    And like how you don't need to be a screenwriter to know what a protagonist is.,1
450,"Imagine you're a makeup artist, when people ask you for foundation do you think of the construction term?    When people unfamiliar with comedy terms hear ""straight man"" they might think of sexuality.",1
451,"     No, when people who lack common knowledge.    It is not some super specific comedy term, it's very common as a term that regular people know. And just like with makeup and construction, you can easily tell the difference in context unless you're autistic.",0
452,"It's called localisation and it's utter bullshit, imo, but it's what people learn going into translation, unfortunately.",0
453,"""Forced me to play the straight man"" isn't even the right translation to that.    Gin said noritsukkomi, which is when you play along with a boke and then tsukkomi it. This only makes sense if you know manzai, which is the traditional Japanese comedy done with TWO people, instead of just one stand-up comedian. Only the legendary, extinct TLNote would be able to explain this.    Don't fault the translators. They were doing their bests. They probably saw it was impossible to translate it correctly, concisely, and intelligibly all at once anyway so they gave up.",1
454,"Jisho has it as “ノリ突っ込み: going along with a joke, etc. at the beginning then pointing out its ridiculousness​“    I think “meme” is perfectly cromulent in this context.",1
455,"It isn't cromulent at all.    noru means ""to get on board."" And tsukkomi is, well, tsukkomi. Hence noritsukkomi is like when Senku pretends to be a food critic, so Gin plays along and pretends to be a food chef, before saying ""no, wait, wtf""    A meme is an idea or joke that gets copied and reproduced as people learn about it. There's no meme that's in a weird food critic pattern like that. The 100 tales are closer to memes than random noritsukkomi would be. If noritsukkomi was a meme, then every word is a meme.",0
456,"It's honestly a pretty genius translation when you realise the word ""meme"" has actual roots in sociologyanthropology and information transmissionmutation over generations. Internet memes are just one medium the effect manifests in, and teaching the concept would likely be beneficial when trying to ensure important information is kept relatively intact over many years.",1
457,"Yeah no it's not lol. I agree that introducing the concept of meme to them could be a good idea, but ""straight man"" and ""meme"" are like 50th cousins.",1
458,"It might not be a direct translation, but it fits the narrative far better than the original message.",1
459,"You don't get to choose what ""fits the narrative far better"" when you're translating it. You translate it, not rewrite the story.",1
460,Direct translation is a poor way of localising media.,0
461,Going from a japanese comedy skit to meme is a bit more than being liberal LOL,1
462,"The concept of the straight man in skits is nowhere near as prominent in western culture. People may know what it is when described, but will often not be able to name the trope when asked to do so. The adaptation of the word was for the sake of presenting something more immediately relatable to the target western audience, though it has the side effect of actually introducing more thoughtful worldbuilding for anyone who knows the actual meaning of the word in scientific contexts.",1
463,"This is a really bad argument, you can't just throw in terms completely unrelated because the term used isn't prominent in western culture. The term meme has so many different connotations to people than the word being used, lack of prominence is not a free licence to use whatever word you want.    There is so many different ways to approach translating this passage that allows for a western audience to understand it than to completely change its meaning.",0
464,The meaning hasn't been changed at all though. The Japanese straight man trope is absolutely a form of meme.,1
465,"The meaning has absolutely been changed, a way to describe something is different to what that thing is. Any trope is a form of meme, you can't just label it that. What if it turns out that his father had introduced the term meme to them through the stories? In the future? How do you differentiate between a straight man, and the term meme as it is commonly used in the future?     People do not use meme in this way, at all. This is lazy at best.",1
466,"The implication here is exactly that Senku's father taught the concept of memes as a way of controlling information mutation as the hundred stories are passed down. Considering the fact they seem to be holding up decently, that would actually be a reasonable explanation. The fact you've raised this as such a hypothetical tells me the idea is probably flying over some heads, which is unfortunate. It really is quite clever.",1
467,"That's the point, the translation is making the inference that his father taught them the concept of memes, based off the fact that he knows what a straight man is. That's a massive fucking leap. If it turns out that they were taught it, I would want that to come from them actually fucking saying it in Japanese, not because he knows what a god damn joke is.",1
468,"Knowing what a joke is and knowing the name of a comedic tropemedium common to a specific period of time and region are two pretty different things. Plus, the fact that anyone reading the subs who isn't a complete hyper-weeb probably won't understand the concept of straight man in the context of manzai routines.",1
469,"Okay so you're not actually arguing in good faith anymore, just picking out that straight manjoke is slightly different. You're completely ignoring my argument, probably because you have realised how silly yours is.    To be clear, to infer that because the character knows what a straight man trope is, that he knows the concept of the meme is incredibly dubious. It is not a reasonable conclusion by any means. Even if it was, it is not a good translation, because that's not what he said. I've already said this, but there is plenty of ways to portray this without using the specific terminology which would be far better than using the term meme which has absolutely nothing to do with it.",1
470,You're operating under the assumption that factual continuity between localisations needs to be 100%. This just isn't true as long as the story is conveyed in the most relatable ways possible per target audience.,0
471,"I'm not, I'm operating under the assumption that the factual continuity between localisations needs to be over 0%.",2
472,Who's the one arguing in bad faith now?,0
473,"You are still. We're going around in circles a little bit but using the word meme is far removed from being liberal, it is a 100% factually incorrect translation.",2
474,"What you don't seem to understand is that manzai, as with many mediums of performance, is memetic. If anything, the localisation cuts directly to the core of the message.",0
475,"What you don't seem to understand is that the word meme has far different connotations to what it is being used here. How many times have you called a stand up comedy performance a meme? There is a difference between a straight man comedy routine, and a meme. It was a horrible word to use in this instance and it definitely does not cut to the core of the message. You can't use a descriptor to translate a subject.    I will repeat, AGAIN. The inference is that because he knows what a straight man routine is, he has been explained what a meme is. You can know what a straight man is, and not know what a meme is. This was the wrong word to use, 100% wrong.",1
476,"It's exhausting to argue with someone who throws around ""100%"" so frivolously.",0
477,This is 100% not an argument.,1
478,Great observation.,1
479,"Well since you're not arguing anymore I'm going to make the observation that you realised that your argument was rather silly, and you kinda just wanted to show how smart you were in observing that the meme has routes in sociology. It is a good observation, however, not relevant to the use of the word in the context.",1
480,"The world must be a lonely place for you if these are the kinds of motivations to ascribe to people.    I'm not arguing anymore because it's obvious you're just here to be right, not to learn or teach. Throwing around superlatives like that just isn't something people do when arguing in good faith.    I have better things to do than throwing words against a wall.",1
481,"If that is how you wish to concede, then I am ok with it. I hope that you were able to realise that you were wrong through the confirmation biases.",1
482,I'm not conceding anything. I'm leaving the room because you're extremely unpleasant to talk to. I hope you realise how much that message makes you look like an absolute manchild.,1
483,Whatever you have to tell yourself to keep your ego in tact buddy,2
484,"No, it's pretty huge in Western culture as well. To the point that the term ""straight man"" is widely used and understood. We already have a word for it due to our own comedy traditions.",1
485,"Agreed, straight man is a pretty fundamental comedy concept.",1
486,"Heck, any sitcom featuring a couple of idiots and one normal person is already a straight man comedy.           It is one of the most common forms of acted comedy.",1
487,Cant agree here. I've never heard of that.,0
488,Then you're just ignorant. It is incredibly common.,0
489,"I'm sure the concept is super common. But the specific term itself? I mean, how many situations could one be in where a specific role in a specific comedy style is the topic of discussion.",1
490,How many situations could one be in where a specific role in a story is the topic of discussion?    And yet you know what a protagonist and antagonist are. You've probably heard of tsunderes and yanderes and self inserts and mary sues and whatnot.     A lot of storytelling jargon is known by even casual consumers of media.,0
491,"Sure, protagonist and antagonist are literary concepts I learned in school. I only recently learned about tsunderes cause of anime, same with Mary sue.    Never heard anyone talk about a ""straight man"" before",1
492,"Sorry you never heard of it, but it is pretty prevalent.    David Spade was almost always the straight man against Chris Farley.    Tina Fey's characters are almost always the straight woman against Amy Poehler's characters.    Jackie Chan was the straight man against Chris Tucker in Rush Hour.    Simon Pegg was for the most part the straight man against Nick Frost in the Cornello trilogies although they reversed roles in The World's End.    Heck even wacky characters can have a straight man moment in a film, like Fran Kranz's stoner character in Cabin in the woods during the scene when Chris Hemsworth says they should all split up to cover more ground and then there is like a 2 second pause and Fran goes ""...really!?!"". That was a straight man moment.    I am sure I can dig up tons more examples, but that was what I could come up with off the top of my head.  If there was a college comedy 101 course, I can confidently say straight man would be covered.",1
493,"     What? In what fucking world?    The straight man is a staple of comedy. If you don't know the straight man, then you probably don't even know the difference between standup and improv.",1
494,     And localising is utter bullshit that caters to the lowest common denominator and has infested the whole fucking sphere of translation. You can't get any translation that isn't localised unless you're looking at university level studies.    I've probably came on too abrasive but I just really dislike localisation.,0
495,"Everything translated is inherently localized in some way, whether you notice or not.",2
496,"Go read academic translations. The amount of notes you need to get through are sometimes bigger than the texts you want to read v.g. Dante's Divine Comedy... Tell me where the localisation is in those I know it still exists in those but my point is that it's nothing compared to what we as a community are used to.    I utterly despise localisation, however I'm not obtuse to the point that I can't understand that it's need. I know there are levels to localisations and not all of them are as blatantly bad as what gets used in our community, for example. I still dislike it. Especially so, because once you get a localised translation no matter the quality you won't ever get any other translation.",0
497,Lack of localisation is a huge part of why so many people think anime is cringy and hard to watch.,0
498,"Maybe a few years ago. Not anymore, anime is turning mainstream if it hasn't already.",2
499,Define mainstream.,2
500,All thanks to localization,1
501,Not really. It's thanks to companies making it easier to watch anime. It's not thanks to the localisation.,0
502,"They should've just gone with ""straight meme""      yuishrug",1
503,"This part wasnt going to translate. English lacks common use vocab for the gag routine. And when people say ""meme"" most think of an internet joke image. Tough being a translator",0
504,"Tough indeed. Maybe some variation on ""made a stand-up joke out of me"" would be better here?     Would be modern and understandable enough and at the same time would also keep the meaning, more or less.",1
505,"You need internet to have meme, without the internet a meme is just an inside joke.    That was just a duo comedy routine not a meme.",1
506,"""A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture—often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon""    Literally the first line. Did you think I was just making shit up when I said the word is a sociologyanthropology term?",0
507,"Academically sure. In practice no lay men every describe word by mouth things as a ""meme""    Anyways, the more important point is that it was a dumb translational error, it is like translating the ""cutting word"" in a haiku as ""poetry"".",0
508,"More people understand the meaning of meme than you think. How do you think mutationsnew formats are so readily created and accepted? Even if they don't realise it's used academically, people can see the relevance in context, especially considering so many scientists of all ages are nerdy jokesters who are absolutely familiar with memes.",1
509,"Not saying that the translation is completely irrelevant, but they could've stuck with the straight man aka tsukkomi in a manzai routine, which even has the western counterpart of double act that is surely understandable to anime viewers? Anyways, it's not worth arguing over 1 translation I guess, I'm out and agree to disagree",1
510,"     It's been a while since you've gone out and spoken to people, huh?",2
511,"It's been a while since you used your brain I see.    If your mother describes stories passed down through generations as memes, maybe she might be trying just a little bit too hard.",2
512,"Actually the word meme was first coined by Richard Dawkins book The Selfish Gene in 1976 as an attempt to explain the way cultural information spreads. The concept of the Internet Meme was created in 1994 by Mike Godwin. So the idea has been around before the Internet, albeit not by that much in the grand scheme of history.",1
513,"Sure, but your average person doesnt know about memetics. Mostly they think of ""internet visual joke images with text"" these days.    There was no good option for the translator to take here. They can 1 do their best to translate faithfully, which would confuse everyone, and get criticized by just about everyone. They could 2 change the meaning to something the average english speaker gets, and get criticized by purists and weebs.  Or they could 3 leave it in Japanese and get attacked by the anti-weebs and casuals.     Personally, 1 think the best move is 3 to leave anything which english doesnt have a word for in japanese transliterated.  Its better to know that you dont understand something than to be lied to.     But they went with 2 here.",1
514,"Oh I actually agree here that using the word ""memes"" in the context used wasn't the best option. Was just being pedantic about an interesting piece of trivia on memes.",1
515,"to be fair, I have no idea why he would be so upset about playing the straight man, but it's a completely expected reaction to being made complicit in memery.",2
516,"I'm fine with that change in translation. It's the same basic concept. Being forced to go along with a joke like that is definitely comparable to the real world acting out an internet meme. Also, I just like the idea of Byakuya deciding that memes were pertinent information.",1
517,"Wait, then what is Gin saying after that? When the subs say ""You guys got the word ""meme"", huh?""",2
518,"I gotta be real, ""meme"" may be a dumb translation but the general idea is more immediately obvious",0
519,"Yep, 99% of people wouldve been completely oblivious to the meaning of that term.",1
520,I'm imagining the 'woman screaming at cat' meme drawn in hieroglyphics,0
521,nan,2
522,Thank you! This is the exact pic I was thinking of.,1
523,Like so?: ,1
524,You're joking but this is probably how it's gonna be in a couple hundred years lol,1
525,"they have memes, they have electricity, the only think left for Senku to do is make internet and Tsukasa is done. Who would want to follow him and live in a cave when you can be looking at memes all day",1
526,So Dr. Stone literally has caveposting.,2
527,Imagine waking up 3700 years in the future and your dad ensured that Bane posting would stay around by making it a tradition.,2
528,"Tell me about Senku, why does he wear that gas mask?",2
529,"Consider this:    They're working their butts off creating stuff from our world.  So in return, we make Stonememes!!",1

544,I think this is the only time Boichi's female design makes sense to me lol,1
545,Yeah in this same ep Gen and Kohaku stand next to each other and you can see crystal clear that Kohaku's eyes are twice as big as Gen.,1
546,There was A LOT of inbreeding to get to Kohaku's generation. That's how you get people with bleach blonde hair but jet black beards,2
547,"lol people like saying that, but it really is just Boichi’s style. I don’t really mind it.",1
548,Also dwarfism if we see Magma's buddy.,2
549,well gen is japanese and kohaku is european right ?,1
550,idk how y'all are sleeping on this character,0
551,"Finally, we have   cotton candy   hydroelectric power. They're about to get a huge kick in productivity. Well done Chrome and craftsman. Let's see what the next task to tackle is.",1
552,"And that's how, Senku started his telecom company in the stone world.",2
553,"Man, can't wait for the episode where they invent data caps",2
554,That'll come with the arrival of a new character. Most probably an old dude that wants to make money.,2
555, Tsukasa dislikes this ,0
556,He literally re invents capitalism later on,2
557,It's the natural order of things.,1
558,This is exactly what Tsukasa is trying to prevent!,1
559,"Knowing senku, he won't go that route. He'd focus on getting 5g to work instead. However, a certain cola drinking, guy would totally do it.",1
560,"Everyone `s reaction to eating cotton candy is just amazing. It reminds me of when i first ate it, it felt just like that.    I love how when Senku mentions a girl, the single girls fro mthe village instantly are all ears  ",1
561,"The girls are interested because not only is Senku the chief of the village but he is also the one who keeps giving them crazy amazing things like ramen and candy that they never even knew existed before, in addition to saving the life of their Priestess who everyone was firmly convinced was 100% certain to die.      Honestly i am shocked half of them haven't straight up tried to jump his bones yet.",1
562,Kohaku is a wall in their way.,2
563,Science is a bigger wall in their way.,2
564,Baby is science.,2
565,Until Senku needs to make smart babies for science.,1
566,"Kohaku's the best fighter in the village and she's let them ALL know who's going to be beaten to a pulp if someone beats her to Senku's bedroom. Also, science is Senku's waifu and shonen anime.",1
567,Kohaku  = Pumps lotsa air in the furnace,2
568,The girls look like they are in a censored hentai,1
569,The Shokugeki no Soma effect,0
570,More like the Boichi effect,1
571,"In terms of drawing womens, Boichi is just a South Korean Oda",2
572,I mean they weren't being subtle at all,2
573,"Makes sense, since Boichi used to make hentai.",2
574,The men to.,2
575,It's like watching someone give a baby candy for the first time.,1
576,Was that Ruri with the 3  sisters?,2
577,"I just love the abso-fucking-lutely cute ""Naan da yooooo.."" Suika gives.",1
578,Tsukasa rolls up after the winter and Senku has already built a fucking power plant and created the assembly line and mass production of consumer goods.     Three quarters of Tsukasa's army defect because of candy and electricity.,0
579,Consumerism was the real weapon all along.,0
580,Just imagine an electric space heater or stove,2
581,"God, these judges in Food Wars are as harsh as ever.",0
582,thanks for the reference. My mind just went to iron chef,1
583,"Not only harsh, Yuuzan Kaibara is a straight up DICK.",0
584,the sounds of a festival in the background as Homura ate the cotton candy really made that moment special.    my favorite running gag in the series is the lightbulb-idea moment that evolves based on their most technologically advanced understanding of light. We've seen a torch before too,1
585,I love it too! Now they just need to progress all the way to LED's!,1
586,"Man, Byakuya is sure a man of culture.",1
587,Correct me if I'm wrong but is river of this size  enough to create electricity for the whole village?,1
588,"Your question led me down the rabbit hole that would be trying to figure out:    The power potential of the water wheel  the efficiency of the generator, the Bearings, and the Gearing system    My answer came to: Not gonna try to figure it out. Let's just say, ""Sure!"" and just accept that now they only need to build motors, transformers, switches, vacuum tubes, light bulbs, batteries, and tons of wires with insulation, develop resistors and capacitors, and a bunch of other stuff to get most of the way to making ""cell phones"" ie. handheld radios.",1
589,You had me in the 1st half.,2
590,ngl,2
591,They could have saved time by using a simpler radio receiver such as a cat whisker detector.        Could also bypass the whole microphone part by using morse code.,1
592,"That is a good idea but a potential is that both parties, receiving and transmitting, would need to know morse code beforehand, and by extension know a written language.",1
593,You could probably teach them some sort of shorthand like prosigns or brevity codes etc.    That said; carbon microphones might also be super neat since they can also be used as amplifiers.    Though if team science is going for vacuum tubes most of this is semi-obsolete.,1
594,"     The question is if there is anyone who knows morse code. Even if Senku knows even that, how he could teach Taiju and Yuzuhira when they are separated? Doesn't communicating via morse code also take high amount time? Since Taiju and Yuzuhira will be watched, they won't be able to send any messages and if Tsukasa will found out and one of his men knows code, Senku is screwed since they could set a trap for him by giving false information.",0
595,"It wouldn't have to be actual morse code. They could make up their own code based on the same principles without much of a problem.    ShorthandBrevity codes etc are things that exist.    Example:    Instead of responding ""I received your message"" you could simply respond ""R"" which is a dot-dash-dot.        Obviously teaching all of this is probably out of the question given their circumstances but there's no reason that morse code or something resembling it can't be used in other circumstances.    That said microphones aren't terribly complex. I'm sure Senku would be able to construct one.        EDIT: Signalling mirrors are also a thing.",1
596,"  Transformers and motors operate on the same principle: Electricity flowing through a coil surrounding an iron core. We have the gold wires now, and making an iron core is piece of cake.      switches: Pfft. Two aluminum blades making contact.      batteries: Lead-acid battery is surprisingly easy.      Insulation: First secret ingredient: barnish.      Resistors: Grab carbon dust and surround it with an insulator.      Capacitors: Two metal plates with an insulator between them.      Of all these, the most critical component for radios are semiconductors vacuum tubes. I'm pretty sure they'll spend an entire episode making them; maybe even two... or three?",1
597,"Well, the hoover dam produces 2,080MW of power using turbines out of 11,000 m3 s of water, that is 2.08   109 w  1.1   104 m3 s, or 1.89   105 ws  m3 . It's a little hard to estimate the speed and size of the river and even harder to estimate the efficiency of a generator made using lighting created magnets and copper plates , but even at 10% efficiency of the hoover dam 1 m3 s of water a very small river 1m2 is size flowing slowly at 3.6kmh generates 1890w, which is enough to power a few Incandescent light bulbs. Probably not enough to light the whole village, but they don't have a lot of electrical appliances, so that's probably enough.",1
598,"Elite bicyclists output 400W of mechanical power at peak during a race. Foot pedaling bicycles are pretty efficient, so let's assume a normal stone-world villager can sustain 50W when cranking a copper wheel with their hands instead of legs. If your calculation is any accurate at all, the waterwheel is producing almost 40 people worth of manpower for 247 ",1
599,"If they're sprinting, an elite level byciclist could, depending on their size, be doing 1200W or more, for several seconds, and someone could probably push 600W for a minute or two. So assuming enough people to rotate and some training and effecient bikes, they could easily get a lot more than 50W for sure. Remember a normal stone-world villager is probably a lot more well trained than your 21st century regular joe",1
600,"Not when it comes to stamina though, especially since most people in the village are kids and elderly.",1
601,"100W is doable for any healthy human. It's like jogging.     Source: friends who can afford powermeters on their bicycles. I have put out  1000W before, my legs were dead afterwards. I usually sustain 250W on the weekend rides.",1
602,All to power one low power radio tower.,0
603,The whole village isn't filled with any electrical appliances.  Their electrical demand is probably like 50 watts.,1
604,Senku's lightbulb is visible from space. I don't think 50 watts is going to cut it.,0
605,"They can use it for the rotational power which a lot of stuff will need, or have enough power for lights light is an insane advantage especially as their days are getting shorter approaching winter and the communication devices at least.",0
606,Fuck lights i want a space heater and an electric stove.     Senku needs to recreate hibachi in the stone world and force all of Tsukasa's men to defect using the power of perfectly cooked steak and fried rice.,0
607,I would defect the instant he offered me candy like some stupid toddler getting in uncle badtouch's fun time happy van. It is a well known fact to the people in my life that I will accept bribes of jelly beans. Show up at my house at three AM with 4 lbs of jelly bellies & a dead body & you've got yourself an accomplice.,1
608,"     Or a hitachi, then every girl would defect to Senko's side.",0
609,"Getting power out of a waterwheel is mostly about how hard the water is pushing on the paddlesbuckets. For an undershot waterwheel like this one the power scales with the square of the water velocity and with the width of the paddle. The wheel is sized so that the paddles move at almost the same speed as the water.    A quick search around the internet turns up that an undershot waterwheel that size  3ms flow,  1m wide,  3m diameter should produce roughly 5kW of power. The river doesn't really look like 3 ms to me but we'll cut the animators some slack and assume the wheel is correctly sized to match the flow. I have no idea what the efficiency of the generator is, guessing 50% based on driving a  100W bulb off 200W of hand cranked input power, so 2.5kW of electricity.    Big pile of guesses and napkin math but I think it'd be enough to light the village or drive a decent size electric motor.",1
610,"I think it boils down to ""probably enough to provide basic power, well within suspension of disbelief if they just use it for a few things.""",1
611,Sure. I mostly wanted to know how undershot waterwheels were designed. With other wheel designs power is pretty straightforward how far the water falls head height times flow rate but water doesn't fall in this design.    The other reason was that I was annoyed at the assumptions involved in scaling down Hoover Dam. They don't have anything close to that head and turbines are considerably more efficient than an undershot wheel.,1
612,hmmm... they have a bunch of metals lying around in chrome's collection.. maybe they can make batteries using those and the acid??,0
613,"I mean, it looked like batteries were in the chart Senku made, bottom right. So yeah, I assume they'll be making batteries, possibly using the lake gases to make acid? Idk what they'd use to hold it though. I'm not sure what metals can hold acid like that",1
614,"They already made glass, that can make a good acid-resistant container",1
615,A glass container would make sense. Or maybe they'll invent plastic.,2
616,"Plastic was indeed on the roadmap, it's even one of the first steps.",2
617,The real thing I'm thinking about is how long those gears are gonna last spinning like that 247. Though it's a bit nitpicky,1
618,"My first thought was to worry about the bearings on the main shaft of the wheel. Wooden wheels in wooden races with no lubrication; that can't be good for longevity. They don't really show it, but maybe they use some animal fat, or something else, to keep everything moving.",0
619,"Probably has less to do with the size of the river than the forcespeed of the current. They don't really need to power the whole village for now anyways, just use it to do work.",2
620,"Ass others have put ""yes"" if you take into consideration that even just lighting a few lightbulbs would be a massive increase in the quality of life. With today or heck even early 1900's standards it would be quite limiting to flat out barely power a two of their homes. But for the situation they are in this would free up resources heavily with the able bodied people to gather resources for the winter while only a few can watch over what they want to do with the power.",1
621,"Well, they don't have almost anything to power at the moment...so yes.    A village that size in 2019? Probably not.",1
622,I guess so as they don't use electricity at all so any thing would be enough for them.,2
623,"Well this is an actual mini-powerplant in Yamanashi, Japan",1
624,"The cotton candy scenes were cute, I like the break from serious stuff every now and then. Was glad to see Chrome come up with such a big idea on his own, this'll be a big step for the village.",1
625,4 more episodes... I hope we get an announcement for a second season at the end.,1
626,A 12 episode season 2 should be  enough to conclude the current arc,2
627,Do you think they could turn it into a movie like how Demon Slayer is going to handle the train arc?,1
628,Hopefully not. The infinity train arc is much smaller than the upcoming one in dr stone. 12 episodes would be perfect,1
629,Gotcha. I’ve got book 8 which starts that arc on my desk just haven’t had time to read it yet. Exciting to hear,1
630,how far ahead is the mangain terms of anime seasons?,2
631,"The 20 eps so far has adapted 52 chapters, the Manga is at 130 chapters so more than enough for a season 2 at the pace they're going.",2
632,"awesome, thank you",1
633,I think it being Spring 2020 is going to be thematic and honestly sort of a brilliant plan given what is going on in the show right now.,1
634,I feel this is going to be a great reaction imagememe template,1
635,"Gen is my favorite character, besides Senku.",1
636,"Dr Stone consistently makes simple things so full of hype. So entertaining to see Senku geeking out with Kaseki and Chrome. They may be generations apart but you can't kill curiosity. And then there's Gen who's from the same era as Senku, throwing in the wtf Senku's ridiculous but yeah those things exist in our time. Love it.",1

640,It's actually hilarious that Senku has become a village chief and used his new riches to manufacture electrical components.,1
641,I understand now why the previous episodes feels low budget. Ofcourse this is a science centric anime and the sakuga scenes are focused on that,1
642,That and Kaseki shock wave.,0
643,Kaseki's animations in general probably cost more than entire episodes of certain other animes.,1
644,"He deserves it, he is best boi, best girl and the best thing in this show.",1
645,Most definitely more than the previous episode.,1
646,tbh it was completely worth it for that,1
647,"It brings me no greater joy than the fact that of all the things senkus dad could pass on, he passed on memes into the year 5739. What an absolute legend. On top of that, using a cotton candy machine to make wire? Brilliant. I love this shows way of making you look at some insurmountable task as something completely possible if you take your time. And the water wheel? It just goes to show how smart chrome and kaseki truly are, that with the basics, they figured out an advancement that took millennia.",1
648,"Only with when he saw gear he was able to develop that ""The Forever Spinny Cotton Candy Machine"" shows he is just gifted and hard-working having keen interest in Senku's science experiment learning and grasping things.",1
649,"I mean, he actually passed on the concept of a straight man routine, not memes. Memes is just a liberal translation.",1

655,"  Homura Stitch      Homura Cotton Candy Stitch      I love how scarily accurate Gen's impression that Kohaku drew her sword xD    I really wanna know what Homura's backstory is. I'm convinced that being a ""survival expert"" is somewhere in there.    It's nice to see Kohaku reacting like a your average teenager once in a while    Senku making was great!    These girls ain't hiding their thirst for Senku. Already listening in for what type of girl she likes xD    Literally baiting people with candy. I love it!    THOSE HNNNNNGG! I really hope that cotton candy offering will make Homura change her mind a bit at least. I'm not expecting her to switch sides but to at least maybe go easy on Senku during a critical moment.        Yeah that word doesn't really work here. A meme is nowhere near what a nori-tsukkomi is. --    SMOL KOHAKU IS ADORABLE <3    Kaseki turning Super Saiyan from Chrome's idea was hilarious xD      This just proves that even if Senku died, people like Chrome will still continue to invent and innovate. Maybe not as fast as their current pace but progress wills till happen no matter what.      Stable supply of electricity get! Holy shit! This is such a big deal!",1
656,Ruri's hips also deserve a stitch. Goddamn that dress really works in her favor.,0
657,Boichi bless,1
658, utahapraises,2
659,     Damn Ruri...    Bless the artist. I heard that that he was a former artist who drew...more cultured art. Anyone know if that's true?,1
660,"Yes, it is.",1
661,Bless you,1
662,"No, bless  you ",1
663,gesundheit,2
664,"DAAAAAMN SHE       THICCCCC    but who are we kidding,? We already knew that",2
665,Homura is just Homare Isekai'd then.,2
666,can i request the stitch of homura sitting facing the camera? thanks,1
667,You mean this? No need to stitch that one since it's just the camera zooming out. You can just take a normal screenshot of that.,0
668,can i request for a stictch of Ruri's monologue  facing the moon. Thanks,1
669,Looks like someone already beat me to it.,1
670,"Homura is so weird looking to me. She's, like, half uncanny valley, half hnggggg...",1
671,When I initially saw them making the gear I was thinking they'd use the river for it. I completely forgot about electric power they could've gotten out of it. Glad to see Chrome putting in work!,1
672,huh...,2
673,Reminds me of how in Factorio I try to jump straight to having bots before I do any other research that wasn't towards bots. I'm too lazy man,0
674,"Well duh, Manpower is the backbone of science. All the brains in the world wont get you anything if you dont have the physical ability to put your plans into action.",1
675,Pretty much same for me in Rimworld. I could have slave camps though.,1
676,I install Robots++ and rushed towards tier 3 bots in Rimworld too lol,1
677,Senku just said fuck it and started using Chidori.,0
678,Damn Byakuya saved the existence of memes for future generations what a hero! And damn 	Chrome reintroduce the waterwheel to the world! Now they will not have to use Ginro and Kinro to power up anything.    And Senku really knows!,1
679,"     Not really, it was just a very liberal translation.",2
680,Tsukasa is giving so much time to progress for the science world. The more time he gives the bigger disadvantage there is.,1
681,He thinks they already have gun powder and poison gas. By that point  numbers bring more strength faster than further scientific advancement.,0
682,I feel like he should surrender if he actually thinks they have poisonous gas. That shit was a war crime in WW1 because it was so horrific and effective at killing large groups of enemies,0
683,"Mustard gas made people die horribly, the hydrogen sulfide just kinda    ends you in a heartbeat    The reason they didn't use it was because, like the show tells us, it just kind of settles instead of dispersing",0
684,You're ignoring the fact that invading in the winter is a bad idea.,0
685,just ask the germans,2
686,And Napoleon.,2
687,And the Swedes.,2
688,Yay Onihige someone who knows Swedes did that mistake first.,1
689,What was that Russian saying about general winter...,2
690,"If someone woke me up and immediately told me we are going to war that would be a solid ""ummmm"" from me.    One bullet zings by and they're done.",0
691, ;    Plus the fact that they have theelectrical power to do essentially whatever they want. Things are definitely gonna speed up dramatically,1
692,"If he invades now, he loses to superior weaponry he thinks they have, if he invades in the winter, the village becomes an unseigeable fortress. Wait until spring, you can amass an army. He's going for Russian strats, throw bodies at the enemy until they're just completely overwhelmed",0
693,"The best part about Dr.Stone is that every character is relevant and has their own role to play. This wonderful episode blessed us with everyone's orgasm face, Homura licking a candy and most importantly plenty of cute Kohaku moments.",1
694,Then automation happened.,2
695,"I think I'll just record observations as I go:       Will the other two be safe now that Senku's survival is known? Yes, thank you for addressing that, show, I was wondering.    Lol, cotton candy machine as step 1 toward making wire. But why gold? Don't they have any copper? Also: wonderful wonderful foodgasms.    lol, I love the giant ears as they wonder if Senku's finally taking an interest in girls. Of course, Ginro understands what it's really about.    WATER WHEEL! WATER WHEEL! HOLY FUCK THEY FINALLY HAVE A WATER WHEEL! :D :D :D XD    This episode was  great ! It went all the places I kept asking ""Why haven't they gone there yet?"" They addressed the danger to the two spies been so long since we seen them I can't even remember their names. They addressed Senku's lack of interest in girls. AND THEY BUILT A MOTHERFUCKING WATER WHEEL! My only remaining question is why gold, and not copper. Maybe it's just easier to to work with at their current level of development.    Next episode: Spartan Crafts Club. Hmm... are we going to see what the other side is up to? Because if anyone are the Spartans, it's then. All they need are a population of Helots to serve them, and that's what they're gearing up to take.",1
696,"We dont know how much material of each they have and they used up a lot of copper for the generator, magnets and first cables.  Copper has also a lot of other uses and gold is relativly useless if you dont need wires or a paperweight.    One of the main reasons to go with gold over copper is that gold doesnt oxidize or react with acid. If they go with copper, each wire would have the be coated to be resistent to weather and surroundings .  Its also softer, so it can be twisted in the right thickness more easily.",2
697,Surprisingly nice move giving Homura some cotton candy. Go science!,1
698,Homura reflecting back after eating the cotton candy was a nice touch,1
699,cottoncandy so sweet your face turns from 720p to 4k resolution,1
700,"I am absolutely loving the pacing of these last few episodes, a far cry from the beginning.",1
701,Every week I watch this show and every week I just come away with a big fucking grin and laughter at how utterly stupid tsukasa's side is. God damn senku is good.,1
702,"How is Tsukasa gonna sell this invasion to his followers? And what's he gonna do about defections?    I imagine most of his followers fall under ""this is the only way"" mindset. Very easily swayed by an alternative.    They keep showing Senku working his ass off but I actually say Tsukasa has the bigger problem no amount of floppy spears are gonna fix.",0
703,He seems to have recruited only people who prefer being top dogs in a world without tech than regular people in a world with tech somehow,1
704,"They really are saving all the world building for Senku's side. During the scenes with Tsukasa they showed bridges, tools, and weapons. Who made all those?    You limit yourself to teenagers and you get the ""fuck all"" knowledge base of middle-schoolers.",0
705," SCIENCE        datass      A few months until Tarzan comes?  Damn.      Ah winter is coming.      Spring is when the attack will be.  So we getting a mega montage or a lnger arc?  Took 6 months for drugs.      But now we have a whole village helping so it should cut down work a lot.      Cotton Candy machine?  What?  hahhhahhaha      Oh shit is Senku trying to lure the spy out with sweetes?      Oh no hes making electronic filliment with it.      THE KINROGINRO CANDY MACHINE!  I LOVE IT!      LOOK HOW HAPPY THE GIRLS ARE!! KYAAA   EVEN THE MEN NOW HAHHAHAHHA       Yep Senku is def after that spy...  Yep they are baiting her with candy hahaha      And the sis sees through Senku, she knows he just wants to make people happy.      So perfecting the cottonn candy will perfect the filliment creationn, smart move.      So the change in direction causes clumps.  They need to keeo it going i 1 direction, thats not too hard acctually.  Yep gears.      Wait Monkey has an idea to make something?  I wondeer what his idea is.      Mass production, were moving now!      WATERWHEEL!  GOOD WORK MONKEY!      UUUUNNNNNLLLLLIIIIIMMMMMMIIIITEEEDDEDDDDD POWERRRRRRR ",1
706,Man it's weird to see anime characters enjoying food that much but keeping all their clothes on.,1
707,"In this show, they only take their clothes off for scientific advancement",2
708,Damn Kaseki can Ultra Instinct Tsukasa by being inspired. Problem solved. lol,1
709,This show just rocks my science boner so damn well. Having Chrom come up with a waterwheel by himself is so satisfying.,1
710,"obligated for gears     I am the bone of my sword     Steel is my body and fire is my blood     I have created over a thousand blades     Unknown to Death,     Nor known to Life.     Have withstood pain to create many weapons     Yet, those hands will never hold anything     So as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works.",0
711,"Chrome really is exactly the kind of person Senku had in mind when he told Tsukasa that there will always be some idiot trying something new no matter what age you're in. Inspiration isn't something that dies. It will always live on in the heart of anyone brave enough to ask the simple question of ""why?""",1

716,Shokugeki no Senku,0
717,Chrome coming up with that idea ️️️    Chidori!!!!!,2
718,Dr. Stone is almost as inspiring as All Might. How can you not believe in humanity,1
719,"I FREAKING LOVE THAT SENKUU GAVE HER COTTEN CANDY.    OMG looking back, they showed that in the OP. I hope she joins the Kingdom of Science. You always have to protect cute anime girls.    Ending was hype as hell. Senkuu looked like a badass.    One of the best episodes IMO. Also glad they acknowledged the Taiju and Yuzuriha issue.",1
720,"What I really like about Doctor Stone is that it shows, how science advancement creates side products for the common people as a collateral Here the cotton candy",1
721,-He wrote on his military communication technology,2
722,"Is Dr. Stone that good,i mean the hype's real but haven't had the time to watch it,should i start",2
723,Get pass the first 5 episodes and it just gets better and better every week,1
724,"ten billion percent, yes",1
725,Absolutely. It just keeps getting better.,1
726,It was my surprise of the season. I watched the first episode on a whim and now it's the show I look forward to the most each week.,1
727,Honestly my favorite show in a long while. It fits a niche unmatched by anything else I’ve watched,1
728,As others have put it has a weakodd start for like the first 5 episodes but after that it REALLY finds it's stride and just doesn't turn back. The concept of the show is just so good and it used in really cleaver ways that I wish more shows did.,1
729,"I honestly wasn't sure I was going to like it at first. I was intrigued by the premise, but half-expected it to fall off a cliff and disappoint me.     I'm really glad I stuck with it. It's given me a new appreciation of how far we've come as a species--a much deeper respect for our resilience,  ingenuity and capacity to come together as a community. You should definitely give it a try.",1
730,"It's just refreshing to see an optimistic show about the positive contributions of the science that we take for granted today, as opposed to the usual ""my d  ck is bigger than yours!"" type shows.",1

732,Smol kohaku's cuteness to behold,1
733,It’s so sweet that senku just wanted to give homura some cotton candy. And maybe strategically smart. But I’m going to go with he’s just a sweet guy,1
734,"Ok now I need to know this... what is the power output of a waterwheel?    edit: First google result was 1-2kwh which is quite a lot, especially for Senku's use cases",1
735,"honestly you don´t really need electricty to harness the power from waterwheels, historically they have been used to drive furnaces, hammers, and bandsaws, and probably plenty of other use cases.    honestly kinda dumb that it isn´t the first thing senku got done once he had a skilled crafter",1
736,"And if anything, converting the torque to electricity adds an extra step, which decreases efficiency.",1
737,I remember Senku mentioning its around 3volts for the manualnturned generator,2
738,"You can get a ton of voltage from those manual cranked generators. Like a TON. The important part is wattage, not voltage. You could easily get like 10000 volts with something muscle powered but besides from making a very loud noise and creating a big ark it is useless.",1
739,This is such an odd yet fun show.  It is sad to see it ending in 5 episodes.,0
740,The incredible thing about this show is how they can  justifiably  make something like cotton candy lead organically into that ending.  It just pays out like a slot machine!,1
741,"Poor Kohaku’s dad, thinking she would care about the shield.",2
742,Waits for a whole week for the next episode    Munches it whole in a few minutes like waffles,1
743,You know shits getting interesting when the soundtrack picks up,0
744,"I gotta say, i'm legitimately impressed.",1
745,They invented capitalism by accident,0
746,Capitalism is a system of gears and a waterwheel.,2
747,It comes with the industrialization,2
748,Tsukasa literally warned us about this,0
749,It's still communism. The state controls the means of production.,2
750,Goosebumps all over at thw last scene,2
751,The craftsman came out of shokugeki no soma. He’s Epic.,0
752,"I'm surprised that Senku didn't think to make a water wheel earlier, way back when they were pumping air into the furnace.",1
753,"I think it was more that it took more time to put together than they typically had. Also, Kaseki said right or not that he couldn't have done it without an iron sawblade presumably because he couldn't make clean, precise, long cuts, so it would be a sloppy mess, so they might have needed to get at least that deep into the process.",0
754,"I think he was referring to the gearing, which would need precise cuts. Making a simple water wheel and a cam to convert the motion to updown motion wouldn't have taken that much precision.",0
755,I think he did something similar on a tiny scale for Gen's bottle of coke.,2
756,"  EVERYONE HOP ON TO THE HYPE-TRAIN, THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IS HERE  ",2
757,"Man I love this anime, just good feelings",1
758,"Yup, this one's getting a rewatch.",2
759,"So I see the word ""meme"" survived. Fucking humans.",1
760,Good to know memes didn’t die out with humanity,0
761,Damn ノリッコミ noritsukkomi is a great word. “Meme” was a decent translation but the definition is “going along with a joke then pointing out its ridiculousness”. I get a lot of great vocab from this show.,1
762,Dr Stone episode 20: Chrome plays factorio,1
763,I just watched how to make hydro power for the last 3 hours... fuck you chrome!!!,0
764,"For a moment I thought they were gonna build a bicycle you know, the gears and all, but this..... this was a huge jump. My mind is blown.",1
765,Cotton candy without dental care? Senku gonna knock the teeth of team Tsukasa with kindness.,1
766,So glad the animation quality went up. Last week was unbearable.,1
767,"Ive been thinking who had the second place for having the most smarts, Tsukasa or Gen? I guess Chrome gets the cake instead    Also I can see this anime becoming a classic in the next few years. Especially if it gets a season 2, we got 4 episodes left to go and a surprize season 2 announcement would be awesome",1
768,"I can’t wait to see how cotton candy pays off with Hyoga, I’m guessing something goes down with that.     Correct me if i got the name wrong",0
769,"This was such a meme worthy episode in a good way, it was funny as fuck.     ;    That ending scene in the other hand was soo hypee",1
770,"Honestly, if Chrome had been looking at the manual electric plant at the same time as he thought of ""forever spinning machine"", he'd probably would've proposed the waterwheel be used to build a hydroelectric power plant.        Great episode! It's starting to get really spicy. I'm looking forward to Homura's role during the coming episodes.",1
771,SO FUCKING GOOD,1
772,Chrome and old man's part was so nice to see. Like they just had to at the very least surprise the genius.,1
773,Grandpa guy went super saiyan wtf,2
774,  Watashi ma smartphone ga!  ,2
775,imagine if all that gold thread got tangled,2
776,That is all i was thinking about lol,1
777,"Hell yeah, love me some montages    Also love seeing chrome innovate",1
778,"I know it was a liberal translation & not a literal one, but my man Byakuya knowing that memes needed to be preserved for future generations of trolls & memelords. Truly a man of culture.",1
779,"The faces and reactions honestly make this series man, It's fucking hilarious. Also, I've learnt more with this than high school chemistry",1
780,This is the arc I enjoy the most. It's when all the characters introduced so far finally accept the science and help senku. One of the best episode for me along with episode 15.,1
781,They're making specifically cell phones and not smart phones but all the examples show smart phones. There's probably kids watching this that don't even know what a cell phone is.    Goddamn fucking memes survived nearly 4000 years. What's the japanese word for meme?    Get fucking hype they have electricity now!,0
782,"The reality is they're making radios I assume, but you'd be hard pressed to find out about a kid knowing what a 2 way radio is currently. People speculated before it might be a more compact version of those backpack radios you see in war vignettes.",0
783,Ah that makes sense.,2
784,"Small blonde girl, hair up in ponytail-like fashion, trying to impress her famous father, constantly saying chichiue...    Mordred is that you?",1
785,yo go chrome and kaseki!! things are coming along for the kingdom of science. i wonder if homura will now come to destroy the water wheel,0
786,Fuck now I want cotton candy,0
787,"I liked the episode, it really transmits the best of Dr. Stone - making the things we already know so special for the ignorant and how we take for granted some of the most important things we have.    But it can't pass my radar the fact that Tsukasa isn't sabotaging Senku's village and his progression from time to time, and I wouldn't be so affirmative in saying like kidnapping people or even killing the ones that make a mistake to be alone or whatever because this anime isn't dark in anyways and actually avoid death, blood and gore.    The point I'm trying to make is, Homura could easily harass the village and the science progression, Tsukasa people are clever and overpowered, they could delay Senku progression so easily like burning supplies, destroying the nearby environment, making the whole area hell for the village to stay put before, during and after winter. Like the indirect war instead of going all out. That said, the show knows how to make the science and comedy golden, but I can't stress enough how poorly they are handling the actual confrontation with Tsukasa.",0
788,More interaction with Senku's science means more chance of being corrupted by science.,1
789,"Lol, it would be funny if they ""mined"" the forest with cotton candy, so that approaching armies would get corrupted.",1
790,"I swear, ever week I think I can't get any more hyped about this show, and every week I'm proven wrong. Like, they made a god damn hydroelectric power station, and CHROME WAS the one who headed it, my boy is finally making major changes in the Kingdom of Science     ;    And as a side thought:   Where the fuck did they get all that gold?   I mean seriously, Chrome, don't you think you went a    little    overboard on those seemingly useless yellow rocks? And can they actually power their machines with raw electricity alone? Don't they still need to create a motor if they wanted to actually use it for anything other than light?",0
791,Probably found the gold in a stream.,2
792,"Well, they have the means to make a motor, because a motor is just a generator in reverse.     Also, if they shift their industry to next to the water wheel, they could just use raw mechanical power without even converting it to energy.",1
793,"Way to show off your new technological gains when you know you're being watched..     Surprise Shokugeki episode on cotton candy.    Now that they have a stable source of electricity, when they manage to store it in batteries, can't they make tazers?",1
794,Got shokugeki no soma vibes this episode.    LOL at gen’s comments about the conversations IQ rising and dropping.,1
795,"Kaseki Demon Rage caught me of guard ! Dats some Yabe level Conquerors haki ! Not thinking about it theres lotsa connection with Onepiece. Chopper-Cotton Candy, Gear-Luffy, Haki-Kaseki.     Im so glad to know that meme's survive thru the 3000 years",1
796,First cotton candy and now hydroelectric power!! Way to go Chrome and Senku!!,2
797,"Winter's coming up, next thing Senku better build is a generator to store all that power before the river freezes over",1
798,That was impressive that Chrome and Kaseki built a waterwheel all by themselves. Now the stone world is moving into the electric age! Should be interesting to see what Senku makes to utilize electricity first.,1
799,"Great episode, but need clarification on something; isn't Homura one of the people revived by Tsukasa? If so, shouldn't she have knowledge of the ""old world"" and know what cotton candy is? Or did she know what it was and was just worried Senku and co. were trying to kill her through poisoning?",0
800,Latter,2
801,"I mean, even if you know what any food is, wouldn't you be suspicious if your enemy came out of nowhere and gave you delicious food? If you don't think that's a reason to be suspicious, you'd be as good as dead.",1
802,"If you pay attention when she finally eats the cotton candy she starts remembering fairs and festivals festival ambience sound starts playing. So yeah, it's the latter.",1
803,Oh I DID miss that! Thanks!,1
804,She does not watch Overly Cautious Hero.,1
805,"A weaker episode this time around with all the cotton candy meandering, but still enjoyable. I'm guessing there wasn't quite enough material for 24 episodes if they wanted to end at a good point, so there stretching things out a bit here.    Still, it's a good time.",1
806,"The cotton candy is an important psychological part. The point is that Senkuu now dragged the villagers into war. The villagers could easily ""sell"" Senkuu out and that way negotiate with Tsukasa. Senkuu is trying his hardest to share the ""small pleasures"" science can bring.",1
807,and boy is he taking his sweet-ass time doing it,2
808,All calculated. He's introducing the villagers to new principles and giving them opportunities to think for themselves.,1
809,Its not the lack of material. There is enough of that for three more 2-cour seasons. They probably just have a specific ending position in mind that they are trying to hit.,1
810,and there is a lack of material between here and where that ending position is,0
811,"I don't think they really stretched much, this was all material from the manga except maybe that scene with Tsukasa, I forget, it may have been expanded. I don't think they could have crammed too much from the next episode into this one if they wanted to.",0
812,It wasn’t as good as other episodes in my opinion,1
813,"Great episode, although that cotton candy looked really bad.",1
814,"If you think cell phones are crazy you wont believe what will be next lol. Dr.stone and BNHA are the true successors of narutobleach. By the time One Piece will end, we’ll have a whole new generation of cosplayers adapting a certain blonde female.. ;",1
815,"Is there a reason they're calling them cellphones and not radios? It sounds like they're building walkie talkies. Is it just for shock value?    Also I'm really surprised Senku didn't think to do a waterwheel for the electricity. They already did it on a smaller scale at the waterfall for the carbonated water, so it doesn't seem like a huge stretch.    IMO the biggest change this could cause is providing lights throughout the village even at night, so they can keep working into the evening, or use the lights as signals to warn people instantly from a distance. Making flashlights might've been a faster and easier way of getting a communications network online than radios, but I guess if they have until spring anyway they might as well go all out.",1
816,Think of the target audience. Would they know what a non smart phones or even what a rotary phone looks like?,1
817,"Uhh, yes? Dude the cell phone craze peaked in Japan harder than anywhere else. Flip phones were still popular there just a few years ago, and everyone knows what radios are.",1
818,"Personally disagree. Kids these days are ignorant of such things, stuck on their smartphones playing their minecraft or fortnites. Damned millenials.",0
819,If I was in a stone age world and had cured the leader ship of it's sick ness. I would start construction on some wooden eye glass frames. The eye glass lenses survived the fight but the melon helmet was destroyed.  He should get everyone's sight perfected and cure the fuzzy vision. This will make every one more effective at certain task.,1
820,Senku has high testosterone,2
821,"On this episode: everyone enjoys eating white stuff       UNLIMITED POWERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR       and holy shit, Chrome figured out how to make it by himself! This lad is truly growing into a scientist now!",1
822,"Not gonna lie, this ending was a hundred times more epic than when he showed off the light bulb.",2
823,"This show is my favorite thing currently airing. The whole idea of using a cellphone to somehow overcome a manpower disadvantage is stupid as hell when I'm sure Senku could just brew up some mustard gas or something, but I've given up trying to think when it comes to this show. The more you think, the more the entire timeline and all the events in it fall apart, but if you turn your brain off it becomes 10 billion percent more enjoyable.     Chrome getting a chance to shine makes me happy to see. Senku's gotta be impressed with just how crafty the kid is without any formal knowledge. That waterwheel is totally implausible and he knocked it out of the park first try after seeing a crude gear. Great stuff.",1
824,"Mustard gas would be a lethal solution, which Senku wants to avoid. He wants to win the war without unnecessary bloodshed",2
825,"Right? Why do people keep jumping to him building WMDs, when even in modern warfare we avoid those things as best we can?",1
826,"Because it's not just a state conflict, but arguably humanity's entire future at stake. Kill a few hundred now so that humanity can have a chance to return to its former glory.    Senku is playing according to morals that I don't think Tsukasa would, if he werent in a shounen. A man who would murder the frozen because they were older than he was, and therefore a part of the system he wanted to take down? That's arguably a war crime right there, it just looks less violent because they're statues. I don't think shounen jump will really push it farther than that, but I would love to see Tsukasa use underhanded technique like hostages and worse to counter Senku's technology, knowing that Senku will never do anything that is outside of modern warfare convention.",0
827,"     Nah. Humanity would be fine either way, even in Tsukasa's world, it would only set things back by a few generations. With the manpower at their disposal they could build a reasonably stable society, even if they did have to rebuild the modern world from scratch. It's not an existential crisis, it's a war over the current generation, and a morally just society would not employ weapons of mass destruction just to secure victory.",1
828,"I replied to the other guy, but in real life this conflict's stakes would be high enough that not playing 100% to win is a fool's gamble. Senku already showed willingness to let the poison gas from the mountain lake take care of his enemies. He didn't warn them, they just plot armor'd through it. So why not drop the facade and use true might to bully Tsukasa's nation into surrendering, and then introduce the comforts that will get them to accept science in their hearts and destroy any rebellious nature remaining?    Killing at most a few hundred with something like mustard gas has to be preferable to a drawn out war that could conceivably claim a lot more lives. It's the same decision the American military made when it first dropped the nukes on Japan.    But again, I don't watch it to analyze it. I'm here for some enjoyable science shit, cute anime girls, and it's 10 billion percent good at that.",1
829,Anyone know what chapter in the manga this episode would be at?,2
830,Next chapter is 53,2
831,Ty <3,1
832,Yet,2
833,Kaseki using conquerors Haki was the highlight,1
834,"Im so confused, wouldnt Tsukasa and his team have the advantage of more supplies if they encircled Senkuu Village during the winter and cut them off?",0
835,Tsukasa explained they would run out of food if they did that.,2
836,I learned more physics concepts than 2 years of physics course,2
837,Anyone else when Tsukasa first appeared and punched the tigers think that he was gonna be that bad guy?,0
838,This show keeps making me more and more hyped,2
839,Senku made crossbow like in episode 2. Why dont  they mass produce those? Good luck invading the village through bridge against mass volley of crossbow fire,1
840,Tsukasa has already shown he's above crossbows. Good idea otherwise.,1
841,"He might be, but most of his men certainly are not. And well what about mass volley of crossbow fire?",0
842,when did they find so much gold? Thought it was precious so weird how they got so much IMO.,1
843,so we have now establish that cotton candy grow lips :D,1
844,That's an insane amount of gold,0
845,Senku aquired the Chidori at the end LOL,1
846,"I hate to ask but, have any of you read the manga? Just asking. No flexing intended. I still love the anime adaptation though.",1
847,Can you actually use  a cotton candy machine  to make wires out of gold ? Is this plausible ?,2
848,Never fourth wall break ever again please!,1
849,"What's the whole part with the ""meme"" moment?",2
850,"havent seen this ep yet.    However, wanted to comment on the recent Senku's dad the astronaut storyline.    It really bothered me that we are supposed to believe than 3700 fucking years have gone by, and a small group of descendants have endured without developing anything further than a few huts.    We are talking about descendants with passed down knowledge and access to the entire world's left behind resources. Descendants of astronauts, basically some of the best people available.    3700 years, living in about 5 huts.    I'm enjoying the show but I found this  excessively  stupid.",0
851,"Technological advancement in small groups over generations isn't guaranteed. It's easy for these ideas to get lost over time when they each depend on the survival of 1 or 2 people.          ""Also, there's not only this one village.""",0
852,"but they didnt get lost. the show establishes that the 100 stories or whatever have been successfully passed down. that means they have been a community non-stop for 3700 years, literally over 100 generations. and they are like 40 people without even agriculture, the most basic of technologies.    and then one guy shows up and builds tons of shit in a few months.    COME. ON.",1
853,"None of the stories we've seen are really about the advancement of society though. From what we've seen it's almost entirely about SURVIVING. Wild animals, probably descriptions of poisoned plants and what not, etc. Anything not related to those probably had some kind of meaning to Byakuya Senku, memes    Edit: the stone age lasted around 3.4m years. the assumption that these folks could advance out of it in only 3.7k years is kind of insane. Even with slightly more knowledge than your average cave-man",0
854,Remember the smart one die within a few years,0
855,"Except they didn't have access to all those resources. Most of the crew died while still on the island, it wasn't until a few generations later that they made their way to the mainland and established the village. It was impossible to pass down all the knowledge they had in those conditions so senku's dad came up with the 100 tales, to pass along what he could for survival. And even if they did make it to the mainland quickly most of the resources there would have already been destroyed or useless. The spinoff Manga established that power plans all over the world went dark or blew up with no one to maintain them, there would have been mass damage to most developed areas due to cars running off the road due to petrified drivers. And that's just the initial struggles of rebuilding society",0
856,"Genetically modern humans existed roughly 200,000 years before the modern era. In all that time, it took them tens of thousands of years to develop rudimentary clothing, and it was only around 10,000-15,000 years ago that agriculture started. Progress is hard, particularly from the bottom, because you don't have the time in the day needed to even attempt things. Even Senku was stuck before Taiju showed up, because he didn't have time to do more than stay alive.",1
857,Anyone else not loving the idea of the phone's? Obviously  they'll be helpful but I just feel like they could have made something else that would have given them a bigger advantage. Like after the poison gas scene i was sure they'd be using chemical warfare or something.,1
858,Show is titled Dr.stone not MurderStone,2
859,This anime is so amazing as always    The part where they used Chrome's catchphrase as an example is so funny     The cotton candy scenes became Shokugeki no Senku haha    Ginro is so hilarious. And he's a MEME now LOL     Also building a hydroelectric powerplant was badass !,1
860,I wonder if Senku in that vacuum tube was a subtle reference to Death Stranding or not.        Probably just a coincidence but  here's an image of 'BB' Bridge Baby for comparison.,0
861,"Forget phones, just bring the old guy into Tsukasa's camp and tell him how to make a boat or something.",0
862,"If I knew an upcoming war with the primal tribe was gonna happen I would recover the one weapon I know would kill people.  A long distance sniper rifle.  I know that it has been thousands of years since everyone was incased in stone but  hardened structures like underground concrete command centers with airtight bioweapons proof seals would be protected from the elements. An they would last test of time. So weapons, ammo and technology would survive. Hell if that's to much effort just create a massive bomb to hide in their camp. A huge gun powder bomb wrapped in tiny stones would enough to kill them.                                             hard",0
863,They cannot mass produce gunpowder with their existing resources. Any weapons they build would need to use some other mechanics.,0
864,Excuse me but didn't they originally find the  Village because they set off three massive explosions at the hot springs?  Why can't they go to the hot springs and collect more gun powder?                                               v,0
865,"The missing ingredient is not sulfur, but nitric acid. They needed the fluid from the cave to make the gunpowder, and they're out of that. If he had more then his other option would be to revive a ton of people for his own side.",1
866,When he created the penicillin to cure the village chiefs daughter. The creation process required many steps but during that process. He was also required to create at least two or three different types of acid. Creating the revival fluid would be very easy. However the war has everyone distracted. I think reviving some defense forces soldiers may give the kingdom of science the upper hand. Military grade hand to hand combat and martial arts combat skills would be important.  However why is it none of the technology from the old world has been recovered?,1
867,     It wasn't nitric acid though. Other types of acid might not function as revival fluid.,2
868,If bat shit and wine can combine together to make the fluid. Then any type fruit like a lemon combined with vinegar would work. Becides the genius who created the liquid was released without using the fluid.,2
869,. . .    That's not how chemistry works.,2
870,Well if you can only exit the stone using a special liquid....how did Sin Q escape the stone in the first place? Plus what happened to his overpowered friend and his GF???  The first person Sin Q woke up was his best   Friend. He was super strong and fought off most of their enemies. Where did he go?,1
871,"Senku woke up because he was thinking super hard, which wore down the stone from the inside. The raw nitric acid helped, but would not work on most people. It worked on Taiju because he wanted to confess to Yuzuriha so hard. They explained this a few episodes in. Taiju and Yuzuriha are living as spies with Tsukasa.     Did you even watch this show?",1
872,Spies? If they were spies why is it THEY HAVEN'T TOLD SENKU ANYTHING AT ALL.  The mentalist has been the spy all along. Not Taiju. Taiju hasn't done anything.  He is most likely out in the woods impregnating Yuzuriha.  If mental activity is a deciding factor how do you explain how the three guys who were tricked into waiting for a rain storm before attacking the village. They were very stupid. Not much mental activity at all.,0
873,     Because they don't have cell phones.     You clearly have been paying attention to nothing. Are you even aware that this is taking place in the future? That humanity has been turned to stone? That there is a character named Senku?,1
874,If his friends learned that Senku was going to be killed by a group of dumb asses why didn't they run to the village to tell him?  Why is the mentalist doing their job?  I think the entire we are going to be spys story line was created to remove the characters from the main story line.  Senku has the talent to create so many things but he keeps getting distracted.  I also wonder what happened during the astronauts trip the main island? What did they find?,0
875,"     They weren't told. Tsukasa would have to be pretty dumb to tell them. Also they do not know where the village is, so they would just be wandering Japan aimlessly.          Because he was both aware of the information and in a position to convey that information.         Ok. You're wrong, but ok.         Maybe we'll find out some day. And yeah, Senku can create all sorts of things, but he's limited by what he  needs  at any given moment, and what tools are reasonably available to acquire it. Unless a goal is needed, it is not worth pursuing a massive tech tree to produce it. As mid-term goals are achieved, new goals become convenient.",1
876,They don't know where the village is... so your saying those three dumb asses were able to keep the location a secret...Right?,0
877,"Which three? The thug guys Hyouga took with him? They wouldn't be able to find their way back with a map, a compass, and a guide dog. Besides, they left  with  the attack, so Taiju couldn't even have followed them and reached Senku ahead of them. Even if he knew the attack was coming. Which he wouldn't. Because nobody would have told him. Because they would not trust him with that information. Because that would be stupid of them. Since he is Senku's friend.",0
878,"So the guys are so stupid that they can't navigate from the cave to the village.  But they are smart enough to not blab and brag about all the weaklings they are gonna kill in that east directional coastlined village. He'll I could Imagen them bragging about it with every one overhearing.     "" Yeah when we go east tomorrow I am gonna kill every last one of them. An they won't be able to leave because they built their village right on a cliff near the water. They trapped themselves.""",0
879,"     . . .    For most people, even if they had been there before they would be unable to locate the place. Most people get lost even with paved roads, much less forest trails. Do you know how many people get lost in National Parks?         They probably didn't know much about the mission before they left, and even if they did, ""keep this quiet"" is a  relatively  simple command. They also wouldn't have known the geography of the place. This was not some carefully planned out assault, this was ""follow the guy with the spear, do what he tells you."" Even Hyouga might not have had a full picture of the area until he got there.     As for Taiju and Yuzuriha, if I told you that there was a town,  someplace  within about 50 miles of your home, and that's  all  the information you had to go on, you could just set out on foot and reach that town, that specific town, not just any town, faster than someone who knew how to get there? ""Coastal village"" might be enough for you to find the place eventually,  if  they'd heard that much, but hugging the coast would be much slower than taking the direct route, since the terrain is very winding and would be more rugged near the coast.",0
880,Your forgetting something important.  They are on a island in Japan.  In a previous place where they lived.  Plus they live within walking distance of the hot springs. They had someone who able to fetch the hot spring water and return within a day. It wasn't normal for her to remain gone overnight. So the village isn't that far away.,1
881,"     What the fork does that have to do with anything? I mean I've lived in the same county for years and I couldn't walk more than a few miles in any direction and have a good idea of where I am, much less if ALL landmarks were obliterated by nature. They're no better off at navigation than someone from Europe would be if dropped into that situation, and again, even if they did somehow posses perfect geographical knowledge of the area, they still don't know where the village itself is within that space.     Also, Taiju never met Kohaku, they don't know anything about her, so they would have no clues to tell how close to her village she was.     The hotsprings were 40 miles from Tsukasa's base. The village is about 20mi from there. Again, even  if  Taiju could find his way back to the hotsprings which is far from effortless for most people, he would have a lot of ground to cover to find the village.",1
882,"Nital is a solution of nitric acid and alcohol commonly used for etching of metals. It is especially suitable for revealing the microstructure of carbon steels. The alcohol can be methanol, ethanol or methylated spirits.    Mixtures of ethanol and nitric acid are potentially explosive. This commonly occurs by gas evolution, although ethyl nitrate can also be formed. Methanol is not liable to explosion but it is toxic.    A solution of ethanol and nitric acid will become explosive if the concentration of nitric acid reaches over 10% by weight. Solutions above 5% should not be stored in closed containers. Nitric acid will continue to act as an oxidant in dilute and cold conditions.",1
883,"Yes, I can use Wikipedia too. The problem is, they do not have nitric acid, nor a viable means to produce it using available materials.",2
884,"   he already has everything he needs...    Chemically, nitric acid is made by bubbling nitrogen dioxide into water. So the objective in this approach is to generate nitrogen dioxide. This can be done by reacting hydrochloric acid, a nitrate salt and copper. Around 80-grams of sodium nitrate, over 30-grams of copper and 100-mL of hydrochloric acid are the quantities needed. The exact amount isn't critical. For useable concentrations, the amount of water being converted should be small, around 20-50-mL.",1
885,And where do you get the sodium nitrate from?,2
886,"Well, you can find it in many foods including bacon, beef jerky, ham, hot dogs, lunch meat, salami, and smoked fish. It creates a distinct flavor, controls lipid oxidation, and acts as an antimicrobial. Sodium nitrate can be found in plants and unregulated drinking",1
887,     Lololololol. So all Senku needs to do is find himself a grocery store where he can find those  foods that were processed using Sodium Nitrate that the manufacturers found elsewhere. ,2
888,"A naturally occurring mineral, sodium nitrate is present in all kinds of vegetables root veggies such as carrots and leafy greens such as celery and spinach, along with many fruits and grains. Anything that grows from the ground draws sodium nitrate out of the soil.",2
889,Sodium nitrate is in vegetation. Vegetation is eaten by animals.  So over time the meat would have Sodium Nitrate in it.  So yeah basically it's every where in small amounts in the dirt.,1
890,"Not in viable amounts. Senku mentioned that they had ways that they could concentrate Nitric Acid, but that they would all be massively time and effort consuming. It's like saying there is arsenic in apples, but it would take thousands of them distilled down to get useful amounts of the stuff. To actually be useful, they would need a more concentrated source.",1
891,Yeah which is why you go to the souce.  You can filter it directly from the dirt.,0
892,"Again, not effectively. You can filter gold out of ocean water, it'd just take you forever to get enough to make a single ring. It's not possible for them to get as much Nitric Acid as they'd need  within the amount of time available. ",0
893,Well just because Nitric Acid worked the FIRST time doesn't mean it can't be substituted with another acid or another nitrogen based liquid the achieve the same reaction. Someone invented a honey based liquid to stop coughing related throat pain. Which has morphed in dozens of products that achieve the same effect. Most of which don't even have honey in them.    A replacement could be found.,0
894,"     Possibly, but it took something like six months of experimentation to find the exact nital mixture they needed, and they don't have time to play around with that again.",1
895,They could do it later then. After they build a hydrogen gas bomb.,0
896,So your saying that his friends will return to his side to render aid?,1
897,The amount of PogChamps in this episode was insane,0
