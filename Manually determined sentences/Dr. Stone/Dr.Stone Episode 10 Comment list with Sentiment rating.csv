0,"I enjoyed the change of the timing of Gen's return to Tsukasa. I always thought in the original chapter he left kinda quick, but spacing it out with the Grand Bout explanation actually worked really well.",1
1,"Yeah I noticed that too. In the manga, it almost seemed like Gen was faking his injuries because he got beat down and then got up and ran away in the span of a few pages. Having the Grand Bout explanation as well as some of Kinro and Ginro's training in the middle, it actually looks like he took some time to recover.",1
2,I can't wait to see Suika's cute little face!,1
3,"Ukyo was this early in the manga, or he being there is anime only",2
4,"I think anime only. They tend to do that sort of thing, filtering in silent cameos of later characters.",2
5,"Though not guaranteed, this is also a good sign that there's intention for 2nd season.",1
6,"There will  definitely  be a second season. Maybe not immediately, depends on how much they think they can get out of the current manga I  think  enough for a second season, but this one definitely seems popular enough to at least justify a season 2 sometime next year.",1
7,"I do hope that's the case.     BTW, you happen to know how well it's been received in Japan?",1
8,Huh these two chapter were some of the few that didn't any science experiment in them. Nowadays Inagaki tries to put at least one in each chapter.,2
9,"Yeah, unless you count Gen making the blood packs, there wasn't a whole lot of experimentation this episode.",1
10,  .,2
11,"The resurrection of modern humanity was saved thanks to...cola.    But it was quite obvious it was going to take that path, Gen had 2 choices:            Side with Tsukasa:      Live in a primitivist-communist society with stone-age standards for the rest of his life.      Shitty and meals that are as complex as simmer whatever plants and meat you put into a pot.      Shitty cold winters when there is barely anything to eat.      Monotone, boring lives where everyone focuses in survive each day and there is no entertainment.      Hoping every day a common cold won't wipe out your entire society.            Side with Senku:      Rebuild modern society with SCIENCE and go back to 2019 cozy standards of living.      Processed, complex food like noodles and cola.      Electrical energy in the night to keep animals and darkness away.      Recreating society and all their luxuries such as TVs, Internet, air conditioner, videogames and memes.      Having antibiotics to beat THE SHIT out of diseases that threaten your life.      It was a pretty obvious choice.",1
12,"If it comes down to having cola vs. not having cola, I'm taking the side with the fucking cola.",2
13,I don't even drink any kind of fizzy drinks yet I agree.,1
14,I'd agree to any deal made by Senku     gintamathispleasesme,1

16,"They dont have toothpaste, I'd be wary of sugars.",2
17,not approved by rhydrohomies,0
18,Even rhydrohomies would side with Senku. Think of all the diverse types of water waiting to be discovered and documented.,2
19,"Like, heavy water 2H2O?",1
20,"Also, various types of mineral water.",2
21,Also reliable clean water,1
22,And desalination,2
23,Isn't the nomenclature D2O?,2
24,I'm pretty sure it can be written both ways,1
25,Huh TIL,2
26,"The taste might be a bit off but you can totally drink that, so why not?!",2
27,"Lol. I've seen that video already. Well, why not? It's expensive.",1
28,If I had more interest in the matter I'd definitely order some just so I could tell people and possibly my future kids that I drank deuterium!    It's one of those utterly meaningless but cool sounding things to do.,1

39,I'm with you as long as we also get toothpaste and softened toilet paper.,2
40,The cola wars are real now.,0
41,I'll take the memes and the cola.,2
42,Especially if that cola is... Dr Pepper!,2
43,"Nope. There will be ""Senku Cola"" and I want it!",1
44,You don't understand... Senku Cola will taste just like Dr Pepper... because Senku is a MAD SCIENTIST SUNVUABITCH.,0
45,"yeah, antibiotics and medicine alone should be enough to sway any functioning modern person's brain to Senku's side. There are only 3 people I can think of who would go with Tukasa:      People too dumb to know what medicine is or the importance of technological progression    People too easily convinced by someone tougher than them    People scared of their lives because Tsukasa can murder a lion with his bare hands.",0
46,We’ll take down Tsukasa’s kingdom by coughing on them.,2
47,"if Senku has read any H.G. Wells, he's already got the ultimate weapon of science available. THE COMMON COLD!",0
48,He should hit them with that anthrax attack.,0
49,     Ultimate Attack: CONTAMINATED BLANKETS!,0
50,Secret Society Blanket leaves no survivors.,0
51,"Fucking hell, season 2 of Yuru Camp is looking dark!!",0
52,As an indigenous American and this comment kills me.,0
53,"Speaking of the common cold and other types of diseases, how would the immune systems of Senku and the newly resurrected people stack up in this new world? Surely said diseases will evolve over time, right?",1
54,"Realistically, I'd expect most diseases that affect humans to have gone extinct, since their homes all got petrified.  The exception is obviously anything that can live in an animal species as well, like the bubonic plague.    Also, any diseases that did survive will have almost definitely lost any resistance to antibiotics that they might have built up, so medicine will be super powerful again.",1
55,"Ooh, I like that last point. Hadn't considered the idea of them losing antibiotic resistance.",2
56,"Imagine if the motive behind the green light was doctors trying the solve the problem of superbugs. I was gonna joke about tolerance breaks, but that actually sounds like a decent idea.",1
57,"It is almost universal that when a bacteria evolves or obtains antibiotic resistance, that organism becomes less able to compete against similar organisms that do not have resistance. This is because the mechanisms of resistance tend to make the bacteria less efficient at completing tasks necessary for survival and reproduction. Generally, resistant bacteria are only at a competitive advantage when antibiotics are present to act as a selective pressure.",1
58,"There's monkeys, and lots of diseases can jump between monkeys and humans.",2
59,"They would evolve, yes. But with most people if not all petrified the amount of vectors has been reduced dramatically. Which means the only diseases they could catch would be:      Ones they had before being petrified unlikely; the stone heals your damaged body parts apparently so presumably it might heal disease    Ones that these strange villager people may have developed which would be evolved forms of pre-existing ones - this is the most dangerous to Senku right now.     Ones that transmit from animals to humans given the low level of civilisation this one doesn't seem too common or likely.",0
60,The animal species that carry diseases that can infect humans as well have existed continuously in this world.  There's no reason to believe the diseases would have ceased to exist.,2
61,"True but the main issue is these diseases more often spread by interaction with humans. At this point of Dr Stone, civilisation hasn't even developed agriculture yet, so it's less of an issue.     There's also the fact that many of these diseases wouldn't have had humans as a viable vector either so they may have lost compatibility.",0
62,"Well bacteria, or at least obligate human pathogens, shouldn’t have evolved much in terms of ability to cause disease in humans due to there not being many humans or any lol for the last 3700 years for them to go through infection cycles, antibiotics, and selection. As for viruses, the human pathogens couldn’t even reproduce unless they can infect other species. Oh well my bio studies are kicking in too much lmao",1
63,Spit on your spear to inflict poison damage,0
64,Use Ruri. Have him compete and win in the competition to be village elder. Then she coughs on him. And in some time we have no Tsukasa.,1
65,Fun fact covering your spear with feces before an attack is a legitimate battle strategy.    Does bonus poison and mental damage.,0
66,antivax jokes but applied practically.,1
67,"If that isn't the biggest flex, I don't know what is",2
68,Polio blankets solve many problems.,0
69,Smallpox blankets,2
70,The same could be said about anti-vaxxers.,2
71,"To be fair, that Lion killing  is  pretty convincing.",1
72,"I think the problem for gen is that Senku is currently fighting an extremely uphill battle. He's got like what, 5 people in his gang now? while Tsukasa as we've seen this ep has gotten an army of beefy dudes under his kingdom, while also being stronger than Kohaku himself.    Siding with Senku is a big, big risk.",0
73,I mean my main point is that one understands how the world works and can utilise it to the fullest and the other insists on bashing rocks together because adults bad. Senku is technically in a weaker position but 1 smallpox blanket or similar and BAM. Tsukasa loses.,0
74," Not even that, seriously, if Senku didn't mind committing a few warcrimes he could synthesize Chlorine gas from saltwater via electrolosis hey look! A new fancy generator! and annihilate Tsukasa's army, and maybe even Tsukasa himself but he's practically superhuman so who knows, easliy.",1
75,If he uses chlorine gas The Hague will get him after he revives Europe.,1
76,"I mean, what's a war crime without an international government to uphold such a thing? Senku already distilled alcohol on his own. xD",0
77,"You forget that Tsukasa may have a big army of people that are in stone form, but maybe like 15 - 20 people actually in petrified.",0
78,"I mean, just bring back a disease and spread it to Tsukasa, the most efficient way",1
79,"I got a feeling that Gen was firmly in the third category.     The flashback to his revival suggests he was never an enthusiastic ally to Tsukasa - it's more like he didn't see other options and was intimidated shitless by Tsukasa's... well, everything.     He's also acting much friendlier towards Senku right from their first encounter.",1
80,"Also gen probably wouldn't survive by himself. For all he knew, tsukasa's tribe was literally the only way to stay alive, even if tsukasa wasnt so intimidating.",1
81,"Agreed, I got the same impression. He just likes putting on a show of things.    Of course, what's interesting is, will  Tsukasa fall for Gen's lie? I'm inclined to think he would purely because he'd think Gen wouldn't dare risk being killed by Tsukasa.",1
82,Or people who want to live in a society where strength is king. A lot of muscle heads may enjoy being in a society where they are valued more than a smarter person.,1
83,"     See here's the thing you are pretty much his hostage until you get a way to fight him back or flee, until then you are with the Tsukasa Kingdom like it or not.",1
84,People who can take advantage of weak people and have bad intentions...,0
85,"So, like conspiracy theorist anti-vaxxers that like strong, autocratic leadership? Sounds like a lot of people with a functioning modern person's brain.",1
86,"Honestly I thought it was weird for tsukasa to be anti science  and idk how he became characterised liek that because those were NOT the vibes I was getting from him.      His core idealogy is to not revive shitty adults and create new freerer society with all the kids right? How is that inherently antagonistic to science? I thought main conflict between tsukasa and senou came from the fact that senku wants to restore societies technological advancements to 2019 standards while reving everyone .  As an anime only I was hoping Tsukasa was going to end up reviving a rival scientist with a more compatible moral set so he could compete with the kingdom of science  granted, he doesn't know seku is alive rn. I don't think the  tsukasa empire adopting some aspects of science is entirely impossible yet either, since Tsukasa obviously values brains indicated by his choicr to revive Gen.",1
87,"I think the main problem Tsukasa sees is that using science means rebuilding civilisation beyond a primitive level, and by doing so, inevitably any social ills in his eyes will come with it.     He's some kind of anarchist because of the seashell thing, it seems.     Whatever elements he chooses to adopt, they will be carefully chosen by Tsukasa as the ones that will not bring with them the things he doesn't want.",0
88,and incels since according to gen they get a harem too,2
89,"Well with the absence of huamnity for 3000 years, diseases that affect humans would be non-existent until agriculture is started which Tsukasa has no plans to do.",2
90,And anprims... whom are unfortunately a real thing. There really are people like Tsukasa out there.,1
91,"Somehow I was already able to guess what the ""an"" part was.    Huh. You know the weird thing is that's one of those moments where I think ""I'm surprised that's a thing...but I'm also pretty sure I already knew it was a thing.""",1
92,"They haven't shown up that much on the news lately but I remember ones seeing on the news an anprim who cut some power lines as a form of protest. He was, obviously, arrested for this. But yeah, that's a thing I remember happened a long time ago where I live.",0
93,Fascinating. I sort of imagined those kinds of people would just run off to live in the woods rather than bother everyone else.,1
94,"Heh, I wish those people were that reasonable. All those groups of extremist believes want the whole world to act and think like they do... by force. It's not just anprims, ancoms are like that too. They spray paint graffitis on the walls of company building, and smash the windows of McDonalds and Starbucks.",1
95,I think that's generally true of an-anythings ANythings?,1
96,"Anarchists. There's a lot more anarchist ideologies by the way, but ancom and ancap are the most well known ones.",1
97,"Believe me, I know there's a lot of anarchist ideologies. So many versions of anarchy and none of them work without paradoxically creating a form of government to enforce anarchy.",0
98,"       Pretty much, lol.",1
99,Legit lol. The fact that these dumbasses haven't considered the fact that the world started as anarchy and society formed as a natural progression of it is hilarious.    It's like they think obama came down from the heavens and enslaved all humanity to the tortures of modern society instead of living in our true habitat!    There will always be people who band together to dominate others for the sake of increasing their own quality of life. Anarchy is just a massive power vacuum.,1
100,"I’m sure plenty of them would love to live by themselves in the woods, but let’s not pretend they have the choice. Soviet and Capitalism are global, and there are very few wildernesses in which you can settle without already having a lot of money to buy the land with.     I don’t agree with anprims, but let’s not pretend that we’re not also forcing our ideologies on them.",1
101,"Research into that term brought me this article. Realistically, I think if we get blasted back into the stone age we can straight up forget about rebuilding a scientific nation.    Just live out our days making nice food from our knowledge of spices, let someone else deal with the pushback against progress.",1
102,Anprims are bad but at least their not fucking centrists.    Make up your minds guys.,0
103,You know...I'm not even surprised by that.,0

105,Or someone with their own agenda.,2
106,Siding with Senku is obvious but Tsukasa is seemingly unstoppable without modern technology. And I get the feeling that any guns are going to take forever.     So I could see people siding with Tsukasa to live. Especially since he’s pretty smart himself and science isn’t necessarily against his goals.,1
107,And the commies.,2
108,"Hard agree, but we gotta remember this guy is a mentalist. 99% sure he was always going to side with senku and only said those things because it would out him in a higher position of bargaining.    Instead of him ""begging"" to be a part of team senku, he made himself desirable and sought after. Playing hard to get essentially.",1
109,"And Senku said as much ""he was convinced as soon as he saw I could make electricity"".",1
110,"I am pretty sure he was convinced the moment he smelled some ramen, Senku just caught on when he made electricity, Gen was putting work with the kingdom of science before Senku defeated the darkness.",1
111,The manga makes it more explicit with a literal scale.,2
112,"You're absolutely right. Senku might be selfish, but he's far from stupid. There's no way he would have ever sided with Tsukasa, let's face it. A guy like Gen wouldn't last a week in Tsukasa's civilization. If cold or hunger didn't kill him, he'd easily get murdered by someone in the village for simply existing.",0

117,Cracking open a cold one with the girls.,2
118,internet ,2
119,I believe it would depend on the presence of some milkshakes in the vicinity.,2
120,"Yeah ive yet to see any positive to living with Tsukasa. I guess the best thing is its simple but there's bound to be someone who just thinks ""if only we had something to make life more conveniant""",1
121,"     The  ""old rich guyz aren't in charge"" , according to Tsukasa.",1
122,"Instead its this young strong guy in charge that just happens to be named Tsukasa.    I hate late stage capitalism as much as the next socialist, but replacing it with an actual primitivist warlord is a bad tradeoff. The obvious solution here is to just convince Senku to not implement oppressive power structures and innovate your way up to fully automated luxury gay space communism. Oppressive power structures isn't really Senku's thing anyway, he mostly seems to care about the science, not how the fruits of that science are distributed.",1
123,"I think Tsukasa just sees oppressive power structures as unavoidable so he might as well limit the damage it can cause.     But what he doesn't get is that... even in oppression, modern society is still so much better for so many more people.    In developed countries, even the poorest live better lives than kings did in the past. Trickle-down economics might be bullshit, but trickle-down technological advancement ultimately benefits everyone.     If oppression is going to exist no matter what, it's better to make the standard of living as good as it can be.",1
124,"I'm imagining a scenario where Tsukasa's tribe is struck by plague of some sort, and his people clamour to use old home remedies or medicines, and then he gets mad at them for using science.    Or he tries doing it and gets outed as a hypocrite.",0
125,"Reminds me of Legion in Fallout New Vegas which prohibited the use of ""modern"" medicine like stimpacks.",1
126,"He never really saw science as a bad thing, just reviving the old leadersrich people in charge.",0
127,"It would be interesting if instead of being frozen from modern day, humanity was froze, say, during the enlightenment. It still kind of sucks for a lot of people, but it's right in the middle of a giant change and rapidly progressing science",2
128,"Fun thing is, late stage capitalism and the old guys in charge are already solved problems even if Senku manages to revive everyone. Money, stocks, paintings and other items of value are long gone and New York real estate isn´t worth much without New York. Senku isn´t obligated to rebuild Amazon for Jeff Bezos. The only thing of value might be the land itself but anything proving that this particular stretch of land is yours is gone. Maybe if you have some witnesses or it´s common knowledge, but it´s probably easy to void every old world claim given that they can´t validate every claim.    So you can depetrify the old politicians and CEO, the corporations are gone, as is Japan. And give their particular skillset, reviving politicians is something decades down the line, when nw structures are already in place.",1
129,"     Oppressive power structures are very easy to fall into. If he just blindly progresses his technology and allows anyone to use it, someone will inevitably use it to overthrow him and install themselves as dictator of the world.    This is what tsukasa is scared of, there  is  legitimate danger in just reviving people willy nilly.    Senku  needs  to care about how the fruits of his science are distributed or his society is bound to fail.",0
130,"Yea, Senku seems agnostic on the topic of  how  we use science, he mostly just wants there to  be  science. He would be just as happy in an anarchist commune as in a totalitarian state, as long as he got to do science.    So he really just needs someone to watch his back and go ""Wow Senku, that's a really neat gun you've developed there! How about next we make sure that it isn't used by some warlord to fuck over people!"". Because like you say, without someone thinking about political philosophy, Senku's society is going to be rather shit, even if it is high tech.    Missed opportunity from Tsukasa, all he did in the end was replace the existing power structure with a new one where he's on top. Insert your favorite  Marxist-Leninist vanguard party critique here.",1
131,"In all honesty Tsukasa should have just bargained to not have the old  revived, but the statues moved to a special ground. Then have a ritual that every 5 years or so 1 person gets de-petrified. Even if it will take thousands of years to de-petrify them all, the number is still finite so as long as you establish a lasting society which is their goal anyway they'd get de-petrified eventually. No blood on anyone's hands and the people de-petrified have zero options aside from integrating into the new society.     Also the ""old"" parameter being the only distinguisher is stupid, he could have Senku make a chartsociological formula out of factors that make it more or less likely that someone will be ""rich and unwilling to give up his previous life"", such as making an approximate map of the socioeconomical areas in Tokio to know whether the candidate was in a richer or poorer area at the time of petrification     Yeezus it's not that hard mate, you're doing a terrible job.",1
132,"     Well, they might be unwilling to give up their old life but it´s gone already. I was rich and powerful in the old world means nothing when everything you own was monkey´s playground for thousands of years.",1
133,"Not to mention that those rich and old guys aren't rich anymore. Say you have some old geezer that used to own half of Tokyo. Guess what: There is no more Tokyo, nor is there a government to defend his ownership claim. What are they going to do? Squat in the ruins and try to fight off anyone that tries to live there with their bare hands?    Power and ownership aren't some magical property, they are a social construct enforced by the state. Take away the state, or replace it with a different state and all those claims are moot. So all that Tsukasa needs to do is go ""Look, Senku, do what you want in terms of science, but please construct the society so that ownership over primary production is communal. No private land ownership and shit"" and he could enjoy all the fruits of Senku's science without having to worry about people stopping him from collecting seashells.",1
134,     Straight up horrible trade off. Everyone got blasted back to the stone age. I bet I can take on Zuckyberg and his networth with my bare hands.,0
135,Or Anarcho Capitalism. Can’t be oppressed by power structures if you are the one oppressing others because there isn’t anyone more powerful than you to stop them.,0
136,"Yea, Anarcho-capitalism is just a fancy way of saying feudalism. Silly, logical incoherent ideology...",0
137,"Still the most logically coherent ideology that has the prefix Anarcho in front of it.    Though my first comment was a joke. I’m not an Anarcho-Capitalist, I’m an Neo-Anarcho-Monarchist with Fascist leanings.",0
138,"That mostly tells me you haven't read any anarchist literature. Sure, the ideas are unlikely to be viable anytime soon, but logically inconsistent? Not really.",1
139,"Anarcho-Capitalism is the only actual anarchic ideology. Any other Anarchic ideology has some sort of leadership structure.    I’m not a proponent of the idea because it isn’t realistically possible, though if it were it seems far more ideal than any other topic vision, but as far as Anarchic beliefs it is really the only one that at least theoretically isn’t just immediately invalidated.",1
140,"Yea, you clearly haven't done any reading on the topic. Here ya go. Read that and then get back to me if you still want to argue in favor of anarcho capitalism.    If you can't see the inherent authoritarian structures in capitalism itself you honestly need to have your eyes checked. Nor are anarchists opposed to leadership, they are opposed to hierarchical structures that happen without the informed consent of everyone in that hierarchy. Such as capitalism or monarchy.",1
141,"Ah yes the old “you disagree with me you must be ignorant”    Truly the finest of arguments. Capitalism isn’t inherently authoritarian, it just as every system without intervention will lead to authoritarianism as most humans, despite purporting to want freedom, do not.",1
142,"No, this is the basic ""You've got no clue what you are talking about, here's some info"".    Now scram kid, if you want to know why capitalism is inherently authoritarian go read that FAQ I linked, I ain't gonna regurgitate socialism101 to you.",0
143,     Birth of the Tau empire,2
144,"thats literally his only thing, why would anyone else care about his fixations",1
145,"""Old people bad"" has to be one of the worst motivations I've seen in a villain.",0
146,So it's basically Occupy Stone World,2
147,     Basically.    Tsukasa is full of resentment towards a drunk guy that rented a beach so now he wants to create a communist-primitivist society where old rich people aren't in charge and people can't own land.,1
148,"Except he will be old one day, and in charge, and become that which he hates",0
149,"That's the doublethink of his character.    It's bad when other people are in charge according to him, but HE being in charge and force others to follow his ideals is ok in his mind.",1
150,Isn't that dictatorship in general?,2
151,But I'll murder you if you don't do what I like. Killing people with old weapons is so more civilized than doing it with metal boxes.,0
152,There is a romance to using spears and swords.    But it is a LOT more messy. Think about how you're going to get those stains out of the carpet.,0
153,"And what happens when Tsukasa gets old, he may be the strongest now but what happens when someone stronger comes along. Will he peacefully give up his power, Tsukasa clearly believes in a might makes right society but what about when the mighty want to do sick ass science.",1
154,Yeah. Tsukasa's empire is basically just Animal Farm with cavemen instead of domesticated animals.,1
155," Especially when you consider the future, Tsukasa isn't gonna live forever and as soon as he's gone along with his ideals his whole society is gonna crumble due to no one else having his brute strength to keep it together. It's doomed from the very start.",0
156,"The empire long united must divide, long divided must unite; this is how it has always been.",1
157,"also the fact that even before he dies basically any of his people who see that Senku has made shit like ramen, electricity, and medicine are gonna jump ship faster than you can say indoor plumbing.",0
158,"They're people from modern Japan. Have Senku reinvent bidets, watch everybody jump ship.",2
159,His followers are likely to become bandits eventually.,2
160,Profligates like you belong on the cross!     jk I always side with Yes Man,1
161,So when he turns 20 and becomes an 'adult' does just kill himself?,0
162,I mean you get a harem of anime girls.,2
163,"That's another thing Gen misunderstood.    2019 standards of beauty requires plenty of skin care products, hair care products, hairdressers with experience on stylish haircuts, body odor products, etc.    Had he chosen Tsukasa he would have been disappointed.",1
164,"This should be true but actually is completely false.    If that was the case then Ruri and Kohaku would look absolutely disgusting since they've been living like that since day 1- but they don't.      Which means that the girls in Tsukahasa's camp likey don't either. I don't think gen would be disappointed at all by their looks, they have anime skin protection after all.",0
165,"but you forgot that being on the MCs side gives them a +10,000,000,000 correction to appearance.",2

169,"If we’re assuming that Tsukasa is assembling former martial arts colleagues for priority resurrection, it’s not far out of the realm of possibility that some minions would seek out old crushes to be their compelled brides.    It’d actually make a really compelling foil to Taiju x Yuzuriha. Taiju waited 3000 years to confess his love and still won’t do it until society is rebuilt, which shows a deep respect and care for Yuzuriha. On the other hands Tsukasa’s immoral commanders will enslave women out of lust, which shows absolutely no respect for the women they claim to love.",1
170,I bet that archer is pretty cute though.,1
171,Your point?,2
172,Bullseye!,2
173,Just want to point out how bizarre I find it that Tsukasa brought back a fat guy.,0
174,"certain types of strongmen look Fat, but are incredibly strong",1
175,"Very fair point. Now I think about it, the archetypical ""strong man"" the kind we think of from victorian circuses looks fat, too.",1
176,"Yeah, fat doesn't take away from your strength, and it's natural to have some fat on you from all the calories you have to take to gain that muscle.    We're just used to skinny muscle because of things like bodybuilding or even boxing where people are losing all their fat to barely pass weigh-in.    Having a bit more fat on you will make it harder to work, but you're an absolute tank in fights.",1
177,"A bit late to the party but, in case you were curious, there's a pretty simple explanation for why a ton of strongman competitors or even your archetypical strong man, as you mention are fat: we can't currently measure caloric output nor protein synthesis accurately enough so they all overestimate.      When you workout, your muscles break down according to the stress you put them under.  You're creating small tears all along your muscles so that they can form new protein strands in those gaps and get stronger in the process.  But to successfully do this, your muscles need excess calories and protein and a mess of other macros, but we're simplifying it here for ease of explanation to develop these new strands.  So while you may, on average, burn 2000 calories a day, your muscles may need an extra 150 calories and some amount of protein beyond that to actually get stronger rather than just repair themselves.  A strongman will require a hell of a lot more, of course, just adding numbers for example.    With this in mind, the ideal method for building muscle and getting shredded would have you eating the  exact  amount of excess calories and proteins required for your muscles to repair and rebuild themselves.  You'd be constantly adding on muscle mass without almost any excess fat.  Sometime in the future, we may be able to enter some machine or have something strapped to our wrists which can tell you the exact amount of calories and protein required for this to happen.  But, as said before, we don't currently have the tools to do this beyond rough estimations.  We can give you metrics such as having  1g of protein per pound you weigh in hopes that it mostly matches your physiology.  And on average, it mostly does for the casual athlete.  But, since a strongman's job is to edge out every single bit of muscle gain they can possibly manage, their best route to success is to overestimate  everything  regarding calories and protein intake.  They can't afford to spend months cutting the excess fat to actually get shredded because cutting of any variety results in loss of muscle.  So instead they perpetually bulk and tack on layer after layer of fat in the process.  Thus, the fat strongman.",1

202,"i think you miss that before modern entertainment people still found ways to be entertained. watching fire burn used to be extremely entertaining to people. it's not that they had nothing better to do; they actually enjoyed it. all the work you do would be benefiting yourself or your community, making it more fulfilling. basically you would have stuff to do whether it's hanging out, observing nature, playing low tech games, etc. there's no evidence that modern entertainment and lifestyle actually makes people happier; there's some evidence that suggests the opposite.    as for processed food, it isn't exactly healthy. otoh, consistently getting a nutritionally complete diet while hunting and gathering could be difficult. there are ways to preserve food in the winter like smoking but people generally had a hard time up until we got mass refrigerationfreezing and could get fresh produce all year round.     however antibiotics and otherwise being able to prevent infectious disease? this is going to be the most common cause of death in the stone world. you scrape your foot, it gets infected, and if you're unlucky you either die or amputate the foot. this would scare the crap out of me.",0
203,Well that's because those people had no idea what anime is.

Just because people in stone age found looking at fire all day interesting doesn't means we would too.,0

Better just kill all these heretics then.",0
205,"Believe me bro, if they organize another crusade, my lazy bum would be the last person they will consider to hire.",0
206,"i mean they didn't do it all day. it would be like after you got your work done people would gather around the fire, watch how it changes shape etc, and hang out with each other and talk.  obviously if you did it all day it would get boring, but that's true of most anything.    if you're not getting constant stimulation this kind of thing is actually interesting. a lot of people don't realize because constantly have some kind of stimulation. social media alerts, music, netflix, radio, etc, there's basically always something and then they become numb to slower stuff.     however one thing i've learned from my meditation practice at the zen center we do 45 minutes silent meditation facing the wall, then some other stuff is that it is possible to slow down and learn to appreciate it more again. it's just harder when you're existing as part of modern society because we're often forced to do the opposite, then have all these distractions thrown at us.    don't get me wrong; i wouldn't want to live in tsukasa's hunter gatherer society even if he was less murdery. i have disabilities, i take prescribed medicine every day that wouldn't be available, etc. however it's fallacious to assume that all aspects of technology and modern society make us happier or give us more fulfilling lives, just because we can't imagine living without them. in terms of personal experience we don't really know what it's like to live in a society without them, so it's projecting at best.    i guess that's kind of long but i think the show is actually dipping into some pretty interesting concepts, then simplifying them because it's shonen and we can't have too much moral ambiguity if we want it widely accessible to a young audience.",1
207,"I don't think the scenario really warrants moral ambiguity tbh.    Tsukasa's motivations are understandable, because of his past and that he channels frustrations a lot of us have dealt with. But his methods are legitimately detestable and his logic doesn't hold up to scrutiny. That doesn't make him a bad villain, it makes him realistically flawed.     Not every black and white conflict is indicative of immature writing, and I'm kind of offended by that notion. If you present enough nuance to make an engaging story and give the audience some stuff to ponder, that's good enough.     Tl;dr, let's stop throwing shonen under the bus.",0
208,"you are kind of putting words in my mouth.     i'm not saying tsukasa should be more morally complex; i'm saying his lack of moral complexity is a story device to focus on other areas, like how technology works and impacts our lives, the character interactions, and the vying between the tsukasa and senku faction, in a way that is widely accessible to a younger audience.      basically you can't expect anything intended to be widely accessible to a 12-15 year old audience to have a story like ""legend of galactic hereos"" or ""the 100."" shonen jump, by definition is intended to be   accessible to this audience. to the extent the author threw moral, cultural, and political complexity out the window in favor of two clearly defined factions with a hero and a villain, that is an entirely logical choice in this context to focus on what he wanted to focus.     it's not like there should be 0 stories accessible to this demographic or that they can't be simultaneously accessible to that demographic and enjoyable to an older audience.",1
209,"     Absolutely this. The writer and the illustrator are both fairly smart people, I'm sure they realize ""old people don't get resurrected"" is one of the dumbest ways to determine this. They no doubt chose to make it clear that Tsukasa is in the wrong since the focus isn't the moral ambiguity of choosing different socioeconomical models, the focus in putting in perspective how absolutely insane human scientific achievements are.",0
210,"Says who?    No really, that's entirely your own machination, unless you want to find me some statements from manga editors that confirms they deliberately shy away from moral complexity for the reasons you presume.    And you've missed the point of my rebuttal. I'm saying the scenario  does not warrant moral complexity because it is an inherently straightforward conflict, regardless of medium or intended demographic . There's no greater moral debate to really be had here in the first place, so it is not a detriment of the series for not exploring that which doesn't exist. If you wanted to introduce moral complexity, you would have to rewrite so much of this scenario that it would barely be the same story, and in doing so, you would have proven nothing because you aren't even criticizing the work itself anymore.",0
211,"based on your response, i'm not sure i'm able to communicate about this clearly. i haven't attempted to criticize the story at any point in this thread, nor have i attempted to prove anything. i look forward to the show every week and it's perfectly fine with me if you don't share my thoughts and opinions.",1

Well quite a lot of stuff is rather recent, my grandma and mother lived in rural post war Germany, the stuff we take for granted isn´t that old. IIRC the greatest invention in the eye of women from my grandma´s generation was the washing machine because doing laundry was a lot of work. Ok, maybe second place, as you pointed out the fridge is awesome.      Anyways retreating from he constant stimulation barrage of modern society might be refreshing, I wonder how we would like it without being able to come back from the retreat, even if we exclude stuff like modern medicine. Earlier generations would probably slap us and call us silly.",1

What have been shown however is far from anarchic, but rather implies Tsukasa as some kind of a leader in position of power.    To be honest, when Tsukasa started spouting about old capitalists, a part of me was hopeful that we would see him establish a good example of a thriving primitive commune, but I guess I was too hopeful. It's pretty much a trope that when a character is spouting about oppression, equality and communismanarchy, it's always ends up as shallow words of a villain.",1

220,"     I said it as a joke, but it's actually an interesting point from the sociological aspect:    He and others may resurrect our civilization, but it's likely the immediate, modern arts are not prominent enough to be fully recovered.    Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Hemingway works may not be lost since scholars that can rewrite them will surely be resurrected, but contemporary literary works such as  ""Twilight"" ,  ""The Hunger Games"" , the digital content made prominent youtubers like pewdiepie or TV shows like  ""House MD""  are most likely truly lost 3000 years later.",1

366,I'm getting Lord Humongous vibes.,2
367,"Gaston and Lefou are back at it again and they are incredibly terrible people to the surprise of absolutely nobody! Senku really has his work cut out for him now. First he needs the antibiotics for Ruri, weapons of science for MagmaTsukasa, and a single bottle of cola to keep his alliance with Gen. Without any of these three things the nation of science crumbles to nothing. SCIENCE TEAM GO!!!",0
368,     No one jumps a person in the dark like Gaston!,1
369,"Oh how I missing all  those ""like Gaston""Tsukkomis in Berserk",1

371,mangahere used them but no longer unfortunedly. Those were quite funny.  especially about Gaskon from Berserk.,1

374,Brb learning cola recipe just in case I need it in the future to bribe people,0
375,Senku better make the OG recipe with cocaine. Make it worth for Gen for letting the world be rebuilt with science.,1
376,Where will he get the nuts from? or will he substitute them with tea? That'll taste different though.,0
377,Tea cola tastes great,1
378,"People thinking of Incest Yuri Love even at a Stone World, no matter at what age we are, there's always a fucking degenerate.    It makes me laugh everytime,.    I like how Gen character is a homology to what truly is worth in life. Gen was a man full of money, girls and fame, and he could as well have that in the stone world as well, but in the end what is the most well worth thing in life are the simplest things; like a simple bottle of coke every now or then.",1
379,"Doesn't matter how much money and pussy we get, at the end of the day we all just want to kick back and drink a bottle of cola.",1

382,That's kind of where I got the idea from. Coca cola in our country is advertised like this.,1
383,"Man, my ""bottle of cola"" is like, anime, manga I read online, and music, which both the one I make and the one I listen to I use electricity. Maybe I'd have be content with the music I can play or make with acoustic instruments? COULD I BARGAIN FOR A SYNTH WITH SENKU-DONO? pretty sure he could at least make a theremin",1
384,"Remember how in the Fallout world Nuka Cola has such great importance?    Yeah, that",1
385,     One man's degenerate is another's man of culture.,2
386,"It's not even ""simple things"", it's ""having things"" at all.    With Tsukasa you are gonna LARP your life as Tarzan and his friends, with Senku you may have back those things that made humans into a Civilization rather than just a mammal with some crafting skills and the ability to run a lot.     And to those who don't know, we already went close to be like the Dodo, so I would side with Senku in ANY case.",1
387,I just realized that Senku can definitely make cola along the way of his original plan and it might be right after it. Senku will definitely make the antibiotic   does  thus re-opening the world of pharmaceuticals. And the first cola was made by a pharmaceutical company   accidentally  .     The build-up writing of this story is incredible.,1
388,"     TIL, thanks!",1
389,"Actually, if you look at the chart, he's got to make carbonated water anyway... The rest is just flavoring.",2
390,"Fun fact, modern cola is made with citrus oils, cinnamon, vanilla and acids like phosphoric acid.    Japan has quite a wide array of citrus fruits so I'm sure he can make a decent approximation of the citrus part.  Phosphoric acid will be a big problem since you need an electric arc furnace for that stuff, but he can probably find some other acidic substitute. You can substitute vanilla with syrup from a variety of trees. The cinnamon might be a problem, but I'm sure Gen won't mind so long as it's carbonated, sweet and acidic.",1
391,"you know that the ""first Cola"" had also an Drug?",2
392,Cocaine?,2
393,Yes until around 1904,1
394,"That glorious age when medicine was made by throwing as many hard drugs into a bottle as you could fit, and then mixing in whatever you thought would cover up the taste.",1
395,Forms of meth and cocaine are still used medically even today,2
396,That glorious age? Have you not heard about the opioid problem that the US has?,1
397,"Modern prescription opioids aren't surgery and fizzy, and not 5 cents over the counter.",2
398,"It still has drugs in it, what do you think caffeine is?",2
399,     An insecticide.,2
400,You know Energy Drinks? They still exist. But i mean the Hard ones,2
401,"Lol I assume you mean ""hard drugs"" meaning drugs known for their addictive properties, which coincidentally caffeine falls into that category just fine.",1
402,"But cola contains cola nuts for flavor. He can't get them in Japan, He has to use green tea or something as a substitute and it will taste differently.",0
403,"I will be a bit frank here, the animation of this show is average. The reason Dr. Stone is still so gripping is because of the amazing plot and the phenomenal sound direction.     You just get super hyped whenever the right OST starts playing. The chill that ran down my spine when I saw the injured Gen grin. That scene would not have been nearly as impactful if the right soundtrack was not playing at that moment.",1
404,It's Ost is gosh darn amazing though in comparison       If it had the same production quality as fire force this would easily be the best show this season      Edit: oh wait it already is,1
405,i havent gotten around to watching fire force since episode 23. does the animation pick back up to episode 1 levels or does it stay choppy like ep 2 and 3,2
406,"I honestly think environmental and sound design which are both AMAZING are MUCH more important to a show like this than animation quality. This is more of a ""talky"" shonen rather than a ""fighty"" one, but the important scenes are extremely well animated; see: magnet making in the last episode.",1
407,"I think it doesn't bother me too much atm as well because there arent really any fast paced fight scenes so far, and thats really where I tend to notice subpar animation. I'm just happy to seethis adapted with a great OST and VA's to support it.",1
408,True. There are drops in animation quality in certain scenes. But the OST is superb the Gen Tsukasa scene is great,1
409,"I think I might be mixing animation with artsyle, but so far it all seems gorgeously designed. It aint no Kimetsu no Yaiba, granted and yes, the animation isn’t always as fluid. But for what it's worth, it doesn’t even nearly as jarring as the animes I feel this criticisms will fit into.     Maybe I've seen some of the bests and worsts of anime, thats why cough Tokyo Ghoul Re:",1
410,"After every slice of life, every romance, every generic shounen, every isekai, and every ""wtf japan that is so random"", this is as fresh as you can get for an anime premise.    It doesn't pretend to be super smart. You don't have to think too hard. As long as it doesn't jump tech too quickly and still stays grounded at least a little, the story will go very far.     I am an anime pleb btw",1
411,Aren't we all,2
412,"Im super hoping theyre saving a bunch of budget for some of the tournament fights coming up. But I wouldn't be angry if it was meh quality. Out of all the shows to come out of jump, this has the best excuse to be animated at an average level. It gets everything done with characters and plot and hype moments of reveal. Fighting is never the main draw so it can get away with some poopoo scenes like that senku and chrome walking scene at the mid roll.",1
413,it truly really doesn't need it. It functions just fine with subpar animation.,1
414,God I can't wait for the soundtrack to release. It has no right to be this good,1
415,It's been out for a few weeks!,2
416,"Oh awesome, thanks for the heads up!",1
417,It’s been bothering me since the first episode. I feel the only thing holding the anime back is average animation. Even slice of life shows like Fruits Basket feel more polished than this.,2
418,"Tsukasa is popular enough to be featured on a panel show?    Jesus that's a lot of muscular   men   high school kids Tsukasa has collected.    He has a spear on his chest! What do you think?    I'm just glad Gen was saved by his tricks. He's a cool dude.    Detective Suika does it again!    Even in this Stone World, I'm glad to see that the Tournament Arc is still alive.       Ruri Stitch!    I see Kinro is a man of culture!       Oh my...         SMOL RURI!!! <3    Senku went for Pottery in the Tech Tree, while Tsukasa immediately went for Archery.. I've seen this game of Civ before.      Where did Tsukasa find these From Fist of the North Star!?    All he wanted is Cola! You picked the right side Gen!     Every week it's getting harder and harder to resist not to read the manga! I'm so excited for next week's episode!",1
419,"     He is the strongest person in his age range. Probably one of the strongest people in the world. He fights in tournaments, so he must be a celebrity martial artist.",1
420,He also has the cool dangerous aura compared to other characters save for Magma.     bigshock,1
421,"Oh, you're approaching me!?",2
422,I'm zipping apart this meme!    STICKY FINGAAASSS,2
423,"well, the ""known"" World is small right now. They do not know many other Peoples so far :    But, while Senku trained his Brain while in Stone. Perhaps Tsukasa flexed his muscles to break free",1
424,"Senku was always a genius given the flashbacks. As for Tsukasa, he was definitely one of the strongest people in the world. You're not given the title of ""strongest primate highschooler"" for nothing, no?",1
425,You know TV Shows really like to overdoing it to get the Views.    But lets see what happen,1
426,He one-punched a lion to death. I think he's actually very powerful.,0
427,"Legit lol. This guy can leap off cliffs and catch birds out of flight and one punch lions, he is probably like Master RoshiHercule compared to normal humans lol.",1
428,"i could counter now with: ""Even Muscles needs Science!""    in the Stone Age there are no items that helps keep your Muscles in tip top shape, or he is a genetic wonder    But, let us calm it down",1
429,"     So the way this whole thing is working so far is that each revived character seems to have some superpower. I wouldn't read too much into it. It's a plot device to accelerate the progression andor produce enemies who can stand up to budding tech. There is no way that the author is going to resort to malnourishment or simple disease to take down the villain when he's doing what he's doing in the story so far. It makes sense, but it's going to resolve the conflict too easily.",1
430,"     That fucking eye glow lmao, why does this shot remind me of hellsing ultimate so much?",1
431,Gonna be honest that Archer looked pretty freaking cool! Hope it is an actual character later on and not just a goon because I like his look even tho we barely saw him.    Btw I got a bit worried since they didn't show Senku's old friends in the cave with Tsukasa.,1
432,"     If someone wants to know:     ""Yes he is and his name is Ukyo""",1
433,Reminded me of Hawkeye's very first cameo in MCU,2

443,"So would waking up a mile or so from TWO of your schoolmates but, here we are. Somehow most people didn't get moved too far apart from each other in this show. xD",1
444,Well the first two people to wake up have been best friends since childhood.,1
445,Probability. The odds of finding one specific person you were looking for? Next to nil. The odds that one of the people you randomly stumbled into might be useful in some way? Not that unlikely.,1

Does he actually have any super human abilities, how strong is he supposed to be?",1
457,"As stated before, he was a professional junior-class boxer, the best in the world in fact. He was quite famous.",1
458,"He is a  really  good unspecified martials art fighter. He is known as the "" strongest primate high-schooler"" because he si stupidly strong while also being nothing more than a high schooler.",1
459,Can he beat the super high school level martial artist Sakura-chan tho.,1
460,you get a monocookie for that.,2
461,"Suddenly, I'm honestly really interested on how a fight between those two would turn out.    My bet is on Sakura-chan  cough ",1

463,In the lore she's called the Strongest Human. While Tsukasa is dubbed the Strongest Primate.,1
464,They only knew him from tv. He's a famous fighter.,1
465," Considering he killed a Lion in one punch, impossibly so. I",0
466,"Pisses me off to no end honestly.    If you want to write a show about science stick to f cking science. Yes, there is a mysterious thing happening - petrification, but the rest of the setting is explicitly said to be our normal world.     And then 3 episodes in we get impossible strong teenagers because the author couldn't think of a convincing antagonist betraying the whole set up.",0
467,"It's not a science show. It's a fantasy show with elements of science. I don't know if you noticed but the show is written so that every single character has super abilities in one area that is impossible in the real world. Every single character and I'm not exaggerating, examples:      Super fighting capabilities.    Super intelligence.    Super stamina.    Super dexterity.    Super magician.    Super apprentice.    Super agility.    Super scouting.    Super guarding...    And the list goes on and on. Every time a new character appears try to notice what their strengths are. I think it's really cool that tsukasa can kill a lion with his bare hands and such or that Senku can keep track of every second that has passed; it gives more flavor to the show. It works as a plot device in a way.     ""And characters with even more ridiculous abilities will continue to join the show.""",0
468,"Yeah, a shame Dr.Stone is a shonen show.",0
469,You can keep the tropes and be faithful to your set up.,1

475,      cough . TOURNAMENT ARRRRRRRC,2
476,"I read the entire thing in less than a week around the 5th or 6th episode, I couldn't resist.    It's well worth it, you have more time to digest his plans, carefully looking at his drawn schematics and appreciate the hilarious reaction shots of their faces.    Now for the first time I know what the people who read the manga in an episode thread feel like... MUST.. RESIST... URGE... TO... SPOIL...!",1
477,Can we just call Tsukasa's team Team Big Chest?,2
478,It's a TOURNAMENT AAAAAAARC,2
479,     Mob Psycho 100,2
480,"Hopefully Tsubasa isn't gonna start a raid soon, now that he knows there is another village.",1
481,"But he had his encounter with Kohaku; and knew she was a primitive human and knew that there's a primitive village    However, he brushed it off since he don't feel threatened by primitive humans since he's the strongest after all",1
482,Oh yea completely forgot about that,2
483,"Yeah, it would be pretty stupid to attack, there is very little or nothing to gain, aside from getting rid of a potential minor threat. Better to avoid them, and build his own empire.",0
484,I'm also not sure he really believes Gen. Tsukasa is impossibly smart and I don't think it's easy to trick him like this.,1
485,"Then again, tricking people should be Gen's whole deal.",2
486,"At this point though he'd be a fool not to. He's already 99.9% sure that Senku is dead, not only that but one of his own men confirmed it. That man is also essentially perfect at lying, he gives away absolutely no tells, and could probably beat a lie detector test too, if one existed. At this point, if he still doubted whether Senku was alive or not, he'd be absolutely paranoid.",0
487,but why would gen randomly leave tsukasa's village if senku is dead?,0
488,"Once enough time passes, there's probably plenty of opportunities to wander off without arousing suspicion. Considering Senku's comment about making chilled cola before Gen returns, I figure Gen's not going to come back for quite a while.",1
489,Because he just got nearly killed by the villagers? Hell I'd book it if Stone Age Gaston speared me in the gut too.,0
490,i think you read my comment wrong.,0
491,"Oh I most certainly did, now that I look at it again. Sorry about that.",1
492,Np lol,1
493,"I actually read the manga so I want to dance around this topic a bit, but there are plenty of reasons why Gen would want to keep tabs on this village, even if Senku isn't there.",1
494,"I'm pretty sure he did not believe Gen, unless the subs are wrong, he basically confirmed Senku was dead, that's pretty suspicious if you ask me, why would he say it like that? that must mean he saw him, die that is, but saw him regardless, which confirms his theory that he was alive to begin with, which could mean he pulled another trick again. And all of this coming from the guy he knows would be best at lying, yeah he knows",1
495,Gen said that there was no trace of senku and therefore he must be dead.    Gen was on a tracking mission and essentially reported that there were no further tracks indicating his life.,0
496,"     This is my only issue with this anime. Having one super smart person is okay, but this anime has a ton of overly intelligent characters. Tsukasa is insanely strong as a teenager AND he has high intellect. I know the story needs to have the antagonist pose a challenge but this story is so unrealistic in that world.",1
497,We started the story by having the guy count off 3700 years. I don't know what realism you're still looking for.,2
498,I mean Tsukasa already seen Kohaku so he knows there a village somewhere out there.,2

As for your point about the OP, I think it shows how Gen is a person that doesn't belong to any faction, he only thinks about how things can benefit him, and only him.

544,"Senku could probably win the tournament himself. Make a rudimentary crossbow and what is Magma gonna do? The villagers probably haven't even invented the bow yet. Of course, if he puts a  training tip on the quarrel it might not convince anyone he's the strongest. He'd have to kill Magma, which doesn't seem like Senku's style.    Tsukasa already realized this and making the bow seems to be one of his first acts. If he and Senku ever come to blows Senku is going to need at least a gun capable of a relatively high rate of fire. A single shot rifle or crossbow can't hold up against a bow except when applied to large scale warfare.     Luckily he seems to be relatively safe, at least for the near future.",1
545,"     The same things Tsukahasa did. I get what you mean that it should be able to catch them off guard but you have to remember that physically the people of the stone world are crazy OP, senku can win if he brings explosives or makes some kind of poison gas, but I don't see that happening. Besides the tournament arc will probably be used to flesh out Kinro and Ginro which is why they are training for it",0

Gen's price is cola. But Kraven is no fool. I'd bet dollars to donuts he's smart enough to not take Gen's words at face value knowing the kind of person he is. So I'm betting that Kraven isn't gonna let this go. So here's hoping that Senku and Gen are smart enough to prepare for that eventuality.,1

550,I miss them :,0
551,"Yeah, and after seeing all the kind of people Tsukasa has I am really curious what they have been doing all this time.",1
552,I think the groups future interactions with Tsukasa will be largely influenced by one thing: if he has an issue with the primitive adults or of course catches Gen’s lie. Tsukasa knows that Kohaku is of a new generation but that doesn’t necessarily mean the village doesn’t have an antidote and thus doesn’t mean there can’t be modern adults among them Tsukasa would need negative iq to hate actual primitive adults. Not saying they do just that it’s a possibility to consider from the limited information Tsukasa saw,0
553,Tbf most of the primitive adults with speaking lines were kind of jerks lol,1

I'm really hoping that Chrome will be the one to deliver the whoop-ass unto Magma, it'll be almost cathartic.

So Tarzan and sharkface were in the same place when the event happened?  Wow bad luck.      Wow Tarzan gathered a lot of statues.  He still is hung up on hating adults...      Oh shit Magma is kickin sharkface's ass!  AND HE STABBED HIM! WHAAAAAA!?  Wait he faked his death hahahahahahhahahah      Who did it and why?  Melonlord is on the case!      So this Magma wants to make Jane and the sis his?  Hmm...      Arena battle, The winner of the fight gets the preistess?      Wow he just wants to be leader and is willing to let Sis die... fuck this guy.      JANE MARRIES THE SIS! YAY!  HAPPY ENDING!      So the rematch is in 1 month.  Ok monkey boy time to science that victory!      So we got the gate boys on team science for good now, nice!  They are gonna help win this thing!      Oh the monkey and the sis were childhood friends?  Oh damn.  Job change!  Sciencer!  Hes a good kid.  Hes happy as long as she lives.      Whats the sharkface whispering?  Hmmm Senku is whispering back, they schemein?      He wants to get home to cover for team science?  Ah yeah not a lot of time to lay around.      Wow Tarzan has an army now.

That's some Candide shit right there, being okay with that killing a priestess. How the whole village doesn't lynch him is amazing. Makes me wonder what the other outsiders of the village did to get banned.    I hope we get to see Taiji and his would-be-fiancee soon. The absolute state of the Tsukasa camp looks nuts. I wonder how the author will illustrate for us the mental loops Tsukasa went through to justify murdering all adults because one was bad to him, but also making a point of reviving a bunch of alleged youths who all look like they live to hear the lamentations of their enemies' women.",0
566,"Yeah, that spear thing was silly. Especially stabbing down, you go all the way through your target, not dexteritously stabbing just 1 inch.",1

571,"Senku next episode: ""Is Pepsi okay?""",2
572,So the way to get to Gen's heart is with cola? I'm honestly really interested to see how is Senku going to make it.,1
573," It's really not that hard, though nailing the taste will probably be next to impossible realistically as the stuff we use to get cola's flavor, such as vanilla, cinnamon, citrus oils, and kola nuts don't and can't grow in japan naturally.     Likely enough, he'll be using honey as a sweetener no suger cane for sugar or corn for corn syrup, some combination of native herbs as the main flavor, yeast to carbonate it, and probably wait to winter to chill it as a refrigerator would be too difficult to build from scratch.      In the end it'll be a sweet, carbonated, mildly alcoholic beverage that probably tastes only barely like a cola.",0
574,"     Sodium bicarbonate was in the synthetic pathway to the sulfa drugs. With sodium bicarbonate and any acid like lemon juice you can make a drink fizz. But besides that, there were other steps that allowed to synthesise CO2.         ""Too difficult""? This is coward talk.",0
575," The problem with that method to make it fizzy is that it's short lived and any unreacted sodium bicarbonate or lemon juice is gonna really mess with the flavor of the soda. While a yeast reaction can make a drink fizzy with very little alcohol added, think Ginger Beer.      Also, the biggest issues with making a refrigerator is that it'd require a compressor, a expansion valve, and a purified gas suitable to serve as refrigerant vapor, such as Freon. The former two both require extremely difficult to build by hand and requiring stuff like vulcanized rubber for valves and belts and electric motors while the latter is just impossible to make without modern equipment.",0
576,"As someone else pointed out, there's always the Peltier effect. You could achieve some degree of refrigeration with just electricity and two conducting metals like, say, iron and copper.",1
577," As I've said in a a few other replies, the peltier effect has too many problems to be used to cool something.      1st of all, without the use of semiconductors the cooling effect of the peltier effect is negligible, barely a few degrees in difference between the hot an cold ends of the system.      2nd. The entire system will still heat up due to the innate resistance of the conductors producing heat. Only the temperature difference remains constant.      Say the system starts with the cold end being 20 degrees while the hot end is 30 degrees. Over time, the system will heat up due to the innate resistance of the materials, resulting in the hot end being 50 degrees celcius while the ""cold"" end is 40 degrees. Making it worthless as a refrigerant.      It's why that despite discovering the effect in 1834 we never used it as a refrigerant.",0
578,I mean he could in theory cool it a bit with thermoelectric cooling like Peltier effect.,1
579," Which requires semiconductors to do, and while silicates are very common in the environment pure silicon is utterly unavailable and would need to be extracted with temperatures significantly hotter than what it took to melt his iron. While other semiconductive materials are just as hard to make and harder to find.       The only other option left is to create an endothermic reaction, but most of the substances that can are toxic while others aren't strong enough to do much of anything temp wise.",1
580,Question: Does it really need semiconductors? Can't you work around it with some other material?,2
581," It can work with dissimilar conductors such as copper and bismuth, but the effect is extremely weak, barely producing a difference of a few degrees.     There's also the issue of while the temp difference between the two dissimilar conductors remains constant the overall temperature of the system will still increase.      IE, say the systems starts out with the hot end being 30 degrees while the cold end is 20 degrees. As time goes the whole system will heat up due to the innate resistance of the conductors, such as the hot end reaching 50 degrees while the ""cool"" end reaches 40 degrees. The difference between the ends remains constant but the overall temperatures continue to rise, making it worthless as a cooling method.     It's why despite the effect being discovered in in 1834 it was never used as a cooling method in favor of regular refrigeration.",2
582,Thanks for explanation : Who knew thanks to Dr. Stone and your help I would learn more about science :,1
583," No problem, and thank you.",0
584,Why can't he just have the cola in a heat-conductive container inside of the container where the endothermic reaction is taking place?,2
585," The toxicity problem mainly comes from the fact that Senku has no access to proper protection for dealing with such substances, not from accidentally poisoning the drink.     Also, the other issue with with the search for powerful endothermic reaction components besides toxicity is its availability in his location.     The only plausible reaction powerful enough to really chill, and even freeze something, he could theoretically get is the Ammonium Chloride + Water reaction. Problem with that is that Ammonium Chloride only occurs naturally on burning coal dumps or specific volcanic vents, one of which would require him to dig up a bunch of coal and set it ablaze just to get a little, and the other would require him to get close to active volcano vents without protective gear. While synthesizing it would require access to ammonia and Hydrochloric acid, which while not exactly hard, he couldn't really do since the only containers he has are clay or copper ones that would react with the HCL and ruin it.",0
586,"     If he can make an isolated container, he can tie it to a fishing rod and cool it underwater at some lake.",2
587," Ah, very true, probably the likely solution, either that or climb a mountain to get some snow.",1
588,"     He says to the man that built an electricity generator out of copper, bamboo and wood.",2
589," A generator is a fairly easy thing to build with the right parts, why do you think there are kits designed for children that allow them to do the same thing with junk they can find around the house?     A refrigerator is a whole different beast. You need special, often toxic, man-synthesized gases to act as refrigerant vapor along with complex devices such as expansion valves and compressors, both requiring high grade metals machined into shape while also being airtight under extreme pressure, and vulcanized rubber to serve as belts and valve seals.      Air conditioners and Refrigerators are true marvels of modern engineering. Even today most people on earth don't even have feasible access to them due to their difficulty to make, thus high costs, and extreme energy consumption.",1
590,"Exhibit A right here that we take refrigeration for granted as a society, it really is a lot harder than it sounds. There was an entire ice trade industry all the way into the early 20th century where people would literally  ship blocks of ice from the arctic  to sell on the European and American markets. All the advances of the industrial revolution didn't make artificial cooling viable until post-WWI, that really blew my mind when I learned about it.",2

619,"Ah Gen your resolve to have cola just saved Senku and the Kingdom of Science. Never underestimate the power of desire.    It's interesting how Tsukasa's face is obscured in both Gen's flashback and at the end when Gen went to face him. It's supposed to inspire fear of the unknown I guess, but we already know what he looks like, and I really don't know what else there is to change about him. But he does have an army building up though which seems very troubling.    I think Chrome's brief flashback on his motivation to save Ruri was enough, it might be an unrequited love on his part but his resolve is to save her at the expense of further desire is a bit admirable if not sad. Let's just hope Magma gets his due defeat in the brawl.",1
620,"You know, something felt off about this anime for awhile, and I just realize what it was and it turned out to be off in a good way.     Dr. Stone totally feels like an anime from the 90s.

623,"   Weekly progress report on the making of the sulfa drug    Map is here    Not a lot of scientific progress today. Distracted by blood and boo... graceful demeanor.    But if you pay attention to the plot, there's a tiny little bit of foreshadowing, I think. This whole thing with Gen is about making cola for him. Well, cola = carbonated and flavored water, and a byproduct of making cola is ... the manufacture of CARBONIC ACID one of the other milestones in the tech tree. Fermentation of alcohol results in carbon dioxide which you can pump into water to form H2CO3. I suspect we'll see Gen make his next appearance when we're closer to that point...",1
624,"You might laugh at the idea of having a cold cola in the stone age can be such a big deal, but in reality, IT IS A FUCKING BIG DEAL. In my opinion, making a good glass of cold cola is way harder than making antibiotic. First of all, the real cola recipe is a industrial secret, which should be unavailable to the public, so good luck with replicating it 100%.     But hey, isn't that we have some general recipe around that Senku must has known about? Yes, that's true, but again, the ingredients are lime, orange, nutmeg, coriander, gum Arabic, cinamon, sugar, citric acid, vanilla extract... just to name a few. Senku would have to find all the plants that can produce these ingredient, which is hard as hell, and then cultivate them for years, before he could make a drinkable beverage that somewhat tasted like modern day Cola...     And all that is just 50% of the road, the other 50% is the journey to invent the method to carbonate the drink, which usually involve having LIQUID Carbon Dioxide, at this point, making it cold is just a too simple task to be mentioned. So, to make a simple glass of cola, you must have all the technology that make antibiotic happen and then some extra steps. With addictive nature of sweeten beverages, Senku can literally use it like Opium and manipulate people at will. Cola is a feat of human Civilization.    TLDR, He who controls the Cola controls the universe.",1
625,"Chika was right all along, Cola is the ultimate bribe!         cheekychika          I'm curious about Tsukasa definition of ""tainted old people"" now cause he clearly revived some  scary young people  already.",2

631,"I am a bit confused regarding Ruri's illness. At first I thought that she recently got sick by a disease, which explained Senku's reasoning to create an antibiotic. But now with Chrome's flashback it was revealed that she was always sick, even as a child. She has most likely a chronic illness. I mean making antibiotics is always a plus in those unsanitary conditions, but it is a bit of a stretch thinking she will get better with them.    As always I am enjoying the show, however, this episode felt ""weaker"", as there was no scientific progress being made. Gen seems a bit more interesting, he is not completely indifferent to science, but he isn't fascinated by it like Senku. Honestly he seems more in line with normal people, living their everyday lives, taking scientific advancements for granted. Also, we did see Tsukasa and his army of muscle-bound gorillas. Sadly we did not see Taiju though :",1
632,"I don't think she was always sick, she's just always been  sickly . Prone to diseases etc.",0
633,"Well, she probably does have a disease that she caught while young, and since there was no way of treating it, she never got better. Pneumonia, bronchitis, etc. They can all be chronic if you live somewhere that doesn’t have antibiotics.",0
634,     I think he's said it in a previous episode but Senku is betting it all on the antibiotic being able to cure Ruri. He doesn't know what she has but the sulfa drug is the best thing he can make with what he's got right now.,1
635,"Which is probably why OP thinks it's a stretch because let's be real, this WILL cure her, the series won't have her die or there's no point. so OP likely sees this as you telling your doctor that you're sick, he gives you a random medicine non specific without knowing your symptoms, only that you drink water a lot and then you suddenly become better and it cures you      Imaging it happening in real life does seem like a stretch so I can actually see where OP is coming from",1

672,"I literally yelled at my TV ""GEN YOU BASTARD!"" when he ran away. I thought that since he only cared about girls, and because Tsukasa was the one who re-introduced him to the world, he would side with Tsukasa. They got me good.",1
673,"No matter what culture or era, there is always that one guy.",0
674,Good to know that Senkuu was able to convince Gen to join the kingdom of science. Gez was not expecting Gen to attack out of nowhere like that. This Magma guy is really bad news hopefully at the next bout they will be able to beat him.,2
675,Tsukasa is such a bad jusge of character looking at all the anime characters he’s awakened who all look like they’re pieces of shit that he was trying to avoid lmao,0
676,"Well, he was picking meatheads that would be easily pushed around. It wasn't exactly that he was choosing virtuous people, so much as ""uncomplicated"" people. People that didn't have abstract notions of property rights and advanced society.",1
677,Ngl not a fan of tsuaka’s army character design. These guys are supposed to be Japanese right,0
678,They also look pretty old considering Tsukasa wanted to get rid of the adults.,1
679,I get this might be anime logic but the fact that Ruri has had this cough since she’s was young and it’s only gotten worse...How is any antibiotic gonna fix that? This doesn’t really seem like a anti-biotic kind needed to fix of disease more like a specific kind of modern medicine needed to fix disease,1
680,"Yeah, I am curious on that, since I would think bacterial infections would either kill you or not over that long, not just stick around. There might be some that last though.",0
681,Not necessarily. Without antibiotics shit that is trivial today can become chronic life long illness.,2
682,"Its been 3000 years since any antibiotics have been used, meaning there should be no drug resistant strains left. And antibiotics are a cure all for basically any kind of bacterial infection.",0
683,"Pardon me, but this one is the weakest episode. Magma is so blatantly assholish as to narrate his evil intents. And the deal to decide the fate of the world is decided over... cola? What the fuck.    Plus, running half-dead to Tsukasa is not exactly a sure-fire way of proving Gen completed his mission. If anything it'd make it way too suspicious.",0
684,"Cola is a simple thing to you and me, but it's symbolic of what Senku can bring in the future. Keep in mind, it isn't just Cola that is persuading Gen to Senku's side. Go back and look at Gen's face when Senku lights up the night.",2
685,The overall show is bad. People are lapping it up because dR StOnE iS sO aMaZiNg. It isn’t. Its a mediocre show at best. Totally forgettable.,1
686,"then why you here mate, lmao",1
687,Did Tsukasa already have a purple coat made just for Gen? That's so thoughtful.,1
688,"Since Senku is a mad scientist, I imagine he'd prefer to make Dr. Pepper over Cola",0
689,"So...I'm kinda worried about our only ""couple"" Taiju and Yuzuriha. They ok? They getting enough to eat?     Have they done the nasty yet?",0
690,"Knowing Taijus OP endurance most likely Yizuriha is well ""fed""",1
691,  ͜  ,2
692,Yuzuhira also has her Super High School Level Dexterity.,1
693,"Yuzuriha: it's not like i enjoy his ""endurance"" or anything baka",0
694,that villager with the Ruri + Kohaku fantasy knows what's up,2
695,i would probably do the same for 2 litres of Coke Zero. Team Science all the way!,2
696,"It seems that 3,700 years was not enough to erase the truest culture and truest man of culture of all which is Kinro.    He knows that Kohaku and Ruri nee is the only true way!    TOURNAMENT ARC is the next part, I don't care who wins, as long as it is from kingdom of science. And I am hoping for a whoop ass from Senku to Magma's faction. Though, I am dreaming of Senku going to be the village leader and have Ruri and Kohaku as his harem.    Tsukasa's goal is not to revive adults, but the scene in the cave and the statues, I can definitely say that there are adults among them. There is no way that those faces are from kids!",1
697,"These episodes feel so short, I need much more Senku, Chrome, Suika and Kohaku in my life.",2
698,"There's not much to say anymore. Show is amazing, watch it",1
699,TBH I would also do it for a Cola.,2
700,Glad to finally see Magma in action,1
701,Damn can't believe Gen is dead rip,0
702,"So, Tsukasa got an army of Pillar Men now?",2
703,"Et tu, cola?",2
704,"Gens a fool, all he asked for was Cola, he should’ve specified the cool refined taste of Dr. Pepper",0
705,"Tsukasa is doing all this cus he got beat up once for collecting sea shells, but if he was that popular of a fighter chances are he could have just bought his own beach front property.",1
706,"Yeah, but that was  after . He still had a chip on his shoulder.",1
707,Cola,2
708,Asagiri getting beat up was fun as hell.,0
709,"Gen must be thinking: ""All I Wanted Was a Pepsi""",2
710,Tsukasa sends Gen to find Senku. Gen comes back referring to him as Senku-chan saying he is dead. :thinking:,0
711,Why do I feel like Gen is going to die?,0
712,"Since he didn't already died thank to the convenient plot armor of carrying fake blood along with him, doesn't look like he's dying any time soon.",0
713,Does anyone watch this on funimation? It looks like they are a couple episodes behind,1
714,"In this anime people die when they are killed even if they don't actually die.    When two characters talk to each other and we, the audience, cannot hear them you know they planning.    ""I'll make you a bottle of cola if you don't tell on us.""    ""You got yourself a deal!""",0
715,Hyped for the super chilled Cola next ep.  NOICE!    Or maybe with ice... idk how cooled it will be.,1
716, my soul is a cheap price to pay for getting electricity and a lifetime supply of cola in the stone age,0
717,"I'm getting sort of worried about the two lovebirds since we haven't seen anything of them. Weren't they supposed to go back to Tsukasa, or did I misunderstand the plan?",0
718,is doctor stone gonna be 12 episodes total?,2
719,"24, with multiple more seasons' worth of manga already.",1
720,Probably 24'ish I don't think 12 is a good number to wrap up the 1st season considering where that episode will be around in the manga. And so far the manga has enough content for 48 episodes more or less. And it's far from over.,1
721,"well, damn. I thought it was gonna be the traditional 12-episode anime. I know nothing about the manga.      I should avoid this sub until I get around to watching it",0
722,"Considering Ruri has had this sickness for what seems like years, I'm willing to bet it's not an infection. Which is not good for the kingdom of science.",2
723,"Asagiri Gen, Please don't tell Tsukasa that I'm still alive. I'll give you a Cola!",1
724,I dont think tsukasa and dr stone are gonna even ever fight. Tsukasa army is most likely get destroyed diseases,0
725,Did someone say... tournament arc?,2
726,"so that's why cola is in the intro. the pacing felt really weird this episode, but it's cool can't wait for the battle to save ruri!",1
727,Ngl I was kinda really scared that Gen was gonna get killed at the end there,0
728,I paused and gaped at my phone for 5 minutes straight and replayd the scene again and sigh in relief when Senku find out that it was fake blood. This boy is so superficial to die!!!,0
729,Just give him his Cola man.,2
730,I hope they make the original coca cola recipe from 1886 that contained cocaine in it. That would be some good ass cola,1
731,"This would have been much more useful last episode, but it only just occurred to me.    Why hasn't Senku utilised steam power yet? Last episode he had two big manpower problems, for smelting the iron and for running the generator. A simple steam turbine would have been really useful for both of those situations.    Maybe the clay he's using to make furnaces etc isn't strong enough to hold the pressure? That's the only reason I can think of.",0
732,"I do think it's a pressure vessel issue. I mean, you can make simple steam engines, like Hero's engine, using copper, but it can't really do a lot of work. The real ""work horse"" steam engines were made of thick iron. There might be alternatives, but I could see it not being a ""plan A"" product.",2
733,"Never thought I'd get chills by the sentence ""Can you make a bottle of cola?""",1
734,Gen is the most compelling character in the series or maybe just behind Senku and I hope this episode shows people why,1
735,Get this boy a cola!,2
736,Mah boi Gen got focken stabbed!,0
737,"Im not really informed but I've read somewhere that only two people knew the recipe for cola right? to the point that they have to ride two separate planes to avoid dying both just in case. if thats true then Senku's promise to Gen was more genuine since senku dont know the recipe, yet he agreed to do so.",1
738,Cola is easy to make. Making cocacola would be impossible. Cocacola is also only specific brand of cola.,1
739,"Cola is just a generic term. It can mean Pepsi, Coca-Cola, RC cola, etc. It doesn't have to be Coca-Cola.",2
740,Checkout youtube someone made a homemade cola,2
741,"Now that it's confirmed that Ruri's disease is chronic, I'm wondering whether or not it will turn out to be something that antibiotics can treatcure.",2
742,The OST is absolutely amazing,1
743,"Damn Ginro is a man of culture isn't he?    ""Ruri has really nice round...eyes"". LOL I like this guy.",1
744,"I'm 100% sure Tsukasa won't buy it.  Gen mentions a village with humans, this will sure attact the lionslayer's attention. Also the fact Gen came into a hurry may sound suspicious to him.  Curious to see how Tsukasa reacts.",1
745,Jeeze almost had a fit when Gen got stabbed    The packets of blood was well played,1
746,"damn my heart dropped when Gen died, then BOOM fake blood",0
747,This show is so much fun,1
748,Still wondering ifwhen this show will actually be interesting. Lots of folks saying it does but I haven’t seen it yet. So far it has been very meh.,2
749,W,2
750,"OK, how much are they being paid for the Cola promotions?",1
751,Cola isn't a brand.,2
752,Isn't cola the most popular soda,1
753,"   Coca    cola yes, but cola is a flavour that anyone can make, use, and sell.",1
754," They're not promoting Coca Cola, cola is just a type of soda. Saying that is like saying a show is promoting A&W Root beer just because they mentioned generic root beer.",0
755,"This feels wrong to say, but does anyone else wish this episode had less plot and more science? I mean I know it's necessary but where are my long ass instructions on how to rebuild the world? I also think they should have given a shoutout to Tesla.",0
756,It will get more and more science next episode trust me         Facts,1
757,"Nah, the Mix is okay. a little bit AnimeManga Magic is needed or the pacing would fall over themselves and nothing would be done    It is nice, if the Anime create curiosity for Science",1
758,"This is more of a characterization episode.  More insight on Gen, update on Tsukasas group, relationship of Chrome Ruri",2
759,Yeah I think he knows,1
760,"Don't worry, you're going to get plenty of science soon enough :",1
761," Why Tesla? Tesla is famous for AC current, that generator and the bamboo fiber light are both DC current and grouped with Edison.",2
762,Edison vs. Tesla! Fight!,0
763,"Sees Gen gets roughed up and stabbed: ""That was ... random. Is he dead?""    Sees fake blood packs: ""Of course not this is a Shonen not a Seinen.""",0
764, Laughs in Chainsaw Man ,1
765,"I have appreciated this episode for something personal, i drink pepsi and practically only Pepsi from when I was 10yo I'm 25 now, i have been without water for years seriously, my mother forced me to check myself in hospital and I'm fine, i couldn't live in a world without fucking cola. Gen I understand you so much.",1
766,That’s... you sound proud of that and you shouldn’t,1
767,That shit can literally kill you dude. Drink water.,0
768,"imagine how many times i've heard people telling me that, i know but pepsi is way too fucking good, i just can't stop",1
769,"     Oh, so that's why Gen is so bent on saving the world by the price of having a cola. He's an addict. Makes perfect sense now.",1
770,"If it was something else i don't know if i would be able to understand him, likely no, but jesus christ, i do understand him so fucking much... XD if i don't drink it for 1 day i start having headache, i hope there is an episode where senku explain how to create it",1
771,Stuff like Cola and Pepsi are good in small doses. You should drink water more.,1
772,What benefits would Cola and Pepsi would bring in small doses that you can't gain from something else?,2
773,"Actually there isn't. It's best not to drink it at all. But if you must, limiting it into small doses would at least lessen the damage it might cause.",0
774,Head-canon...    Episode 6: Kohaku falls for Senkuu    Episode 10: Kohaku daitan makes a move on Senkuu    Kohaku too cute <3,1
775,"Maybe I’m missing the forest for the trees here but it feels like the overall narrative keeps presenting these new and lofty goals while the plot itself doesn’t actually progress at all. I don’t think we needed an entire episode to explain Gen’s decision, and hope they up the pacing in the second cour because despite the hype, Dr. Stone’s been kinda...boring.",1
776,"These past few episodes are all set up. Now they have introduced the key kingdom of science members which will progess the scientific development; Introduced the villain of the arc Magma and the big climatic tournament. With that all the arc's goals are starting to come together; Save Ruri by inventing antibiotic, win the tournament to prevent magma from marrying Ruri, create Cola for Gen. Now the plot will definitely take off cause with all these in line Senku will start working on his road map. Based off the manga, I'll say next episode will be setting up the very last few pieces Senku needs for science and the first high-stakes mission will start.",1
777,"I really cannot go into heavy spoilers, but the reason why the manga is so beloved is that it keeps getting better and better the more the story progresses. Some of the stuff that will happen in this season will blow your mind.",1
778,"I’m already loving this, and you say it gets better? Say no more my friend I’m HYPED! The show isn’t for everyone, especially if you’re looking for fight scenes and the typical burning passion in a battle manga, but for me I love the science aspect and boy oh boy ever since Senku met Kohaku this show is off the charts in terms of enjoyment",1
779,It gets REALLY better. Especially when we get to S2,1
780,S2? Do you mean 2nd cour?,2
781,"That, and the next season as well",1
782,Is the next season confirmed yet? I think I'd only be able to hold off on the manga until this season ends lol,1
783,"this episode covered 2 chapters instead of 3, the third chapter would have been amazing in this episode",1
784,Yeah I do like the show but still cant see any reasons for why it wasis so hyped. Its solid and has an interesting and unique premise,1
785,"Feel the same way, had to skim through the episode. I will definitely wait until the season is over to continue watching it.",1
786,"Well, they're setting up some dominoes this episode, and if I remember correctly, they start knocking them all down in pretty short order.",1
787,What a sexist little society the village is.,2
788,"Well, it isn't a modern one.",1
789,Imagine how well things would go in a Tsukasa might-makes-right world of neanderthals.,1
790,That's just Japanese culture.,2
791,I still triggered that Senku thinks that electricity is Edison accomplishments,2
792,"I think the bamboo filament version was by him, which is why Senku brought it up.",2
793,"Bruh, first popular lightbulb",1
794,"""The Edison bulb""= ""Electricity""     ;    Whatever you say man.",2
795,Japanese like Edison.,1
796,"Before electric lights electricity was niche. People kinda knew what it was but there was no practical use. Edison's lightbulb prompted the creation of power stations to feed electricity to the general populace, and the Ed in ComEd stands for Edison, as he built the company.     Sure Tesla did a lot of neat stuff with electricity, but Edison is the one who brought it to the public.",1
797,Tesla deserved better compared to that furry edison.,1
798,You take that back!,2
799,"It's not that he credit's Edison with electricity, but he did make the same  type  of bulb that Edison did.",2
