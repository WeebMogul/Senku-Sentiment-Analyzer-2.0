4,Tsukasa's voice is better than I thought it would be. Though they did change what they thought Tsukasa could turn out to be. I made a comparison..     ;    This episode gives a better feel for a building a world starting from scratch. I can't wait to see what's next.,1
5,"Can we talk about the changes to Tsukasa monologue.Because it seems they changed it from ""I don't want the Seniors to bring back the old ways."" to a ""The seniors are tainted and will rob the youth's future by owning the land.""     And the anime monologue almost completely misses the ""I want us to live in harmony with nature and stay at this tech level and not move forward"" part.

54,"second this. he's a kind of anarcho/libertarian-primitivist with a fascist touch. you can see the libertarian when he mentions taxes on the same level as private property :    also: the fascist vibe comes from wanting to purify the society via exterritorializing what you assess as ""impure""  - instead of realizing that ""impurity"" greed, egoism, posessiveness is just the logic of capitalist relations of production, which depend on exactly those attributes.",1

59,"Fascism has to do with extreme nationalism. While it can take some ideas from eugenics, it is not the source of the ideology. He's not a fascist, it's literally impossible to be both an anarchist and a fascist.",2
60,"Fascism really doesn't have more to do with nationalism than anything else. Fascists try to have total control over others, like the character in the show MIGHT do. He seems to 'know' what's best for the world, and if he goes through with it and want everyone to follow his will, then he is a fascist.    Edit: I was wrong, mixed it up with authoritarianism it seems. MB",2
61,"That's called authoritarianism, it's not exclusive to fascism. Fascism 100% has to do with nationalism, it's one of its key defining traits. You cannot be a fascist without being an ultranationalist.",2
62,"My bad, I remembered it wrong. Looked it up on a site.    It seems that because facism and authoritarianism often go hand in hand at least in the examples I know; Germany and Italy doing WW2, I mixed them up. Then Antifa we hear so much from in the US, must be solely authoritarian, since they go against nationalism, but still want to force beliefs unto other people by violence.    You are right, fascism is defined to be nationalsocialism on some websites at least.    But can you explain for me, if it's not too much to ask, why Antifa is often labeled as a fascist group, if they are not nationalistic? It seems to be many places on the web where people call them fascist because they are fine with using violence against non-violent people to force their views. But it seems to me now that they are 'only' authoritarian, which is of course not better at all, but totally different.",2
63,"People call antifa fascists because, they have fascism confused with violent authoritarianism. It is a useful comparison, though, as it shows the hypocrisy. Antifa don’t think what the fascists did in the mid 20th century was wrong, just that it was done for the wrong reasons and targeted the wrong people.",1
64,Dude what? Antifa pretty much only organizes as a response to Nazi protests.  Point me to where some body of antifa said we should Holocaust all the rich people and put them in camps.,2
65,Ah I see you're an expert on right wing propaganda against Antifa.,1
66,Thanks mate :,1
67,"I wouldn't call white nationalists/supremacists a non-violent ideology at all. There have been several mass-murders and killings done by people who explicitly say they are white supremacists. Many of them literally want a white ethnostate, which can only be achieved through violence.    Antifa occasionally punches them with the goal of stopping that from happening. You can argue that's wrong or ineffective, but calling antifa fascist or authoritarian is nonsensical. Many of them are anarchists which is the exact opposite of authoritarianism.",1
68,"With that logic I bet enjoy watching muslims be attacked/harrashed as well. After all some terrorists are muslim.    You can't lump people into groups that easily.    You also shouldn't fight violence with violence, and especially don't try to make things violent because the other group 'might' become violent later. Sometimes antifa are the aggressors, don't forget that.",0
69,"Like I said you can think that it's wrong, my main point was that calling antifa authoritarian or calling white nationalists ""non-violent"" is inaccurate.      ;    If someone is openly a neo-nazi, then I think we should be intolerant of that person so that publicly advocating for genocide and hate crime remains unacceptable in our society. If some people think that occasionally punching them or the people that proudly march next to them is the best way to communicate that, then I'm personally not going to lose much sleep over it.",0
70,"The biggest problem isn't antifa attacking white-nationalists tho. It is when they attack 100% non-violent conservatives. I wont justify violence against non-violent journalists, simply because they disagree with their political view.    You are free to have your own opinion, but it becomes very dangerous when you justify violence against non-violent people. Just because you disagree with conservative political views, it doesn't make those people less human.",0
71,"This is some intense concern trolling. White nationalist groups consistently attack minorities and kill them.  Far left extremism in the US killed 0 people in 2018, while far right extremism is far and away the largest group that is actively targeting and hurting people.",0

80,"Why do you think he suddenly ""forgot"" a fourth use of sodium carbonate?",1
81,"What does that imply? Sorry, I'm as dumb as Taiju",1
82,That the fourth use can be used to harm someone.,2
83,he was also crafting something that looked like a crossbow at night while the others slept. so conflict inbound.,2
84,"and the next episode is literally called ""The Weapons of Science.""",2
85,Didn't notice that,2
86,"I was thinking it would be used as chalk for writing with so the episode title was a ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" deal.  Tsukasa could force Senkuu into writing all his knowledge down and would no longer need him alive.  Granted that would take a lot of time and stone tablets, so yeah it's probably a more direct weapon...",2
87,His knowledge of how to be insanely strong?,2
88,"Meaning, if Senkuu shared the fourth use of calcium carbonate as writing, and Tsukasa wanted to create his perfect world which Senkuu opposes, then Tsukasa could have Senkuu record all the knowledge he possesses and then remove him as an obstacle.",2
89,"My bad. I got the character names mixed up. But even still, as a writing material, it would make more sense to use chalk or crushed rocks. Instead of going through all the trouble of getting those shells just so you can make paper or writing utensil.",2
90,Agreed 😅,1
91,Yea I was thinking gunpowder or caustic acid,2
92,It implies that the 4th thing is something that senku doesn't want Tsukasa to know.,2
93,Gunpowder I'm pretty sure. The reason why he is not saying it is because he specifically wanted CaCO3 as a deterrent for Kars.    Edit: Ok I just watched ep 3. Mb.,2
94,He left it out on purpose to prevent any more tension with Tsukasa.,2
95,"  Sodium Carbonate is lethal after ingesting as little as 4 grams and is known for its water solubility.    Didn't Taiju and 	Senkuu inhaled some of it when former one was was pouring it to this long vent? They choked few times during that time. I don't think it was only smoke since in previous scene agriculture we see how dusty  the product they made is.",2
96,"What they inhaled was most likely just high concentrations of CO2.    They kinda went quickly over that part, but to expand without complicating it: the most common seashell you'll find is CaCO3, but you can also find all sorts of permutations depending on what created it.    For the purposes making mortar, ceramic and potentially glass, what they want is CaO Calcium Oxide. Basically just remove some of the oxygen and carbon. How do you do that? Just burn it! Above 400 degree Celsius CaCO3 splits into CaO and CO2.",2
97,r/theydidthescience,2
98,That's probably gonna be the case every week.,1
99,"More likely he's going to use it to make explosives. You can mix it with the bat shit/dirt in the cave to eventually make purified potassium nitrate.    Calcium Nitrate in solution plus Calcium Carbonate potash lye -  evaporated calcium carbonate and  potassium nitrate:    CaNO32 4H2O + H20 +K2CO3 -  KNO32 + CaC03 4H20    He has everything he needs nearby, and combined with him making that crossbow I'm thinking he's either going to make some sort of impact explosive launched from the crossbow or just straight up gunpowder",2
100,"Wait, that’s  potassium  carbonate. That’s from ash, so easily obtained, but what about the calcium nitrate? Calcium carbonate + nitric acid? What happens if you simply mix lye with nitric acid instead?    gotta love how this anime’s threads are turning into the Anarchist’s Cookbook...",1
101,"Nitric acid reacts with calcium carbonate to form calcium nitrate. The leeching process turns calcium nitrate into potassium nitrate.     Put soil from the caves into troughs that have drains/spigots on them. Pour water over cave dirt; let stand for a few days fully saturated water dissolves the calcium nitrate from the soil. Drain and retain water from the vat. Pour water through fresh batch of soil and let stand. Repeat a few times and you now have what is known as petre water. Boil the petre water and add potash lye K2C03; the calcium precipitates out. After soaking, strain the lye to remove sediment.     Boil the solution until salt crystals form boiling creates salt and saltpeter., then scrape off salt crystals. Replace evaporating water. Strain again and let cool slightly this removes last of the salt, leaving saltpeter in solution, boil down to concentrate and thicken. Strain again.    Cooling produces saltpeter crystals. Let this dry in the sun. You now have potassium nitrate crystals ready to ignite.      DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME YOU WILL BLOW YOUR DUMB ASS UP OR AT BEST BURN YOUR HOUSE TO THE GROUND",1
102,"Ok. But my question was also, why use calcium carbonate at all? Why not just mix nitric acid and potash lye? Is the reaction easier to control this way?",2
103,  potash lye    Is not Calcium Carbonate. Calcium Carbonate is a by product of a process for making explosives but you do not use the Calcium Carbonate itself for that from my understanding.    I mean potassium comes from the word potash. It was made in pots from ashes.,2
104,"Are you talking about   sodium   calcium carbonate more or less chalk,   sodium   calcium oxide lime, or   sodium   calcium hydroxide lye?    I don't think   sodium   calcium carbonate alone is actually as poisonous as you are saying.    Edit: Yeah, it looks like you're mistaken. The LD50 for an adult male would be somewhere from 250-300 grams, not 4. And that's just extrapolating based on rats. also, heres the one for calcium carbonate, the one mentioned in the show, which is even less toxic. Edit2: sorry I got a little mixed up. Yes, sodium carbonate is not as toxic as the other commenter was claiming, but we should have been talking about  calcium  carbonate, because that is what they were talking about in the show. It is also calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide. Everything else I said is still applicable, after the corrections.     I just had come back from a wiki dive about the calcium ones, and when I read and responded to somone writing about sodium carbonate, it just stuck in my head. Sorry for the confusion.    Edit3: Screencap of the correct compound ",1
105,  in its powdered form can be thrown like pocket sand    Well it looks like Senku doesn't need anything else then. Pocket sand is the ultimate self defense weapon.,1
106,at night while the others slept he was making something that looked like a crossbow. poison darts are most likely his plan. or at least some form of overkill tranquilizer,2
107,  keep a bag of it at your hip at all times. Prehistoric Taser.    More like prehistoric   POCKET SAND  ,1
108,"I believe he is going to use Calcium Carbonate to make steel weapons, as it appeared that he was making a crossbow while the others were sleeping.  Another reason I believe this is likely is because he was talking about how it was going to bring back technology.  Going from the Stone age to Iron age is a pretty big leap in tech IMO.",2
109,"Lol, lye is not anywhere close to that dangerous. You might get chemical burns, but it would be a terrible tool to actually try to kill someone with. Better off finding a poisonous plant, or just straight up hitting them with a rock.",1
110,"I was like, SPOILERS! Then I read the comment and was like, ok science but still low-key spoilers. Idc tho",1
111,"Quicklime has been used as a gas weapon in historic times, blinding and chocking people.    There’s actually more than 4 uses for calcium carbonate anyway, it’s used in glass production, mining and can be heated to create a very bright light - hence “limelight”’s use in theatres.",2
112,From what I understood he didn't want that Jojo guy to learn the fourth use,2
113,I love how you refer to him as Jojo guy,1
114,if i remember my chemistry lessons from old youtube videos correctly then its time to make some fucking guns.,1
115,Gunpowder,2
116,"Hey, just a heads up, it's calcium carbonate, not sodium carbonate. I fell into the same trap, but here's the screencap ",1
117,It’s still an oxidizer.,2
118,That is Calcium Oxide.,2
119,You can make some kick-ass tortillas with it.,1
120,"Can't you use sodium carbonate to harm someone firearms, I think? Also, remember how Mr smarty pants said he didnt trust mr girly hair? I think that senku here wants to have something to keep the "" 1 primate high schooler"" under control, to keep his gang safe since tsukasa won't hesitate to destroy statues he ""didn't deem worthy"". Just a theory, personally I like the poison theory.    Edit: changed guns to firearms, since guns is too specific, and I don't think you can pull out a random pistol in their situation",1
121,"im thinking it's a way of defense against TsuKARSa, but afaik, calcium carbonateNot sodium main uses don't involve any thing that could be used to defend.    What interesting, though, is that calcium carbonateto be more exact, the lime, CaO, in limestone can be used with silica to make glass with the help of sodium carbonateSoda, soda lime glass to be exact. Glass is chemically stable, that's why all the chemical stuff are stored in glass beakers and stuff. Although , i'm not sure how stable soda lime glass is compared to the borosilicate that chemical beakers are made out of. With glass, Senku could probably make a lot of other chemicals that he wouldnt be able to now.        Edit:  So i rmb Senku's line ""in this world without guns, he's unstoppable"". I did some research into gunpowder and shit. While you can't make gunpowder with calcium carbonate, there's an interesting equation : CaNO32 Calcium Nitrate + KCl -  CaCl2 + KNO3. KNO3 is saltpeter, a major constituent of black gunpowder. Calcium nitrate can be made from calcium carbonate through various ways. Although this equation doesnt yield much KNO3 and not used to produce it industrially",1
122,I’m pretty sure you mix charcoal sulfur and lye together to make a very weak gunpowder irl. It’s also something that eats the fats in your body so it can dissolve your skin. It’s a bonding agent in concrete. If you put it in water the steam that comes off is an acid so you gotta be careful when whitewashing a house.,2

206,"AOT Spoiler""the original Japanese title, Shingeki no Kyojin, 進撃の巨人, can be read in two ways: as ""the Titans of the Advance/the Advancing Titans"", or as ""the Advance Titan"", officially translated as ""the Attack Titan"", where ""Shingeki"" is used specifically as a singular modifier, just like how ""Yoroi"" is used as a modifier for the Armoured Titan, Yoroi no Kyojin, 鎧の巨人. It was staring people in the face with how often people referred to the Armoured/Colossal/Female Titans, and yet few people in the Western world picked up on that.""",2
207,"Got it, thanks.",1
208,No I meant for Dr Stone,2
209,"Ah, in that case it's straight forward: on first reading, most people would assume it reads as Dr. Stone, like a human doctor named or nicknamed ""Stone"".    We find out in this episode that it can also be read as ""a  doctor  stone"", where ""doctor"" is an adjective for an actual piece of stone, in this case referring to soap.",2
210,I like that,1
211,"behold, the true protagonist",1
212,Convention goers take notes.,1
213,No one ever expected anime to be in their bathrooms this whole time.,1

217,What are you saying? We're some kind of Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei Herz! ?,2
218,I feel the writers of this anime should give a round of applause for themselves. They did it! They finally did it! They said the title of the show!,1
219,It took 1 and a half whole episodes but they've finally done it!,1
220,But do they sell Dr. Stone waifu water?     girlishploy,2
221,Yuzuriha hasn't had her turn yet!,2
222,Oh there's  waifu water  alright,1
223,The real Dr. Stone was the soap we made along the way.,2

257,It has so many different uses though. What's the most plausible? Some kind of poison? Explosives would require more ingredients...,2
258,Sulfur and charcoal my dude for explosives. so burn some wood and there’s probably sulfur in that cave he was stuck in.,2
259,Also lye is used in forging. Primitive technology on YouTube used lye to wick iron beads from clay. Alec steele on YouTube uses lye to make his Damascus steel. He uses it as a bonding agent.,2
260,"The only danger I could find in calcium carbonate is over dosage, so I guess they could poison him with enough of it?",2

291,"Wew, Tsukasa is a beast!        I was 10 billion percent worried Yuzuriha was going to get broken throwing her around like that.          Well, how about that, Dr. Stone is a bar of soap.          Ah, I was wondering if/when the point was going to be addressed of selectively saving people to create a new world, and letting those who were already older remain as stone.",1
292,Yuzuriha rescue was basically a giant  sweaty palms  sequence. So much tension.,1
293,That scene and this episode gave me so much anxiety that I was not expecting from this show,1
294,Gave me a feeling that despite her being a  stone  statue; she looks like she'd break easily; fragile like fucking plastic by how she was being thrown around,1
295,"  I was 10 billion percent worried Yuzuriha was going to get broken throwing her around like that.    Yeah I was also worried about that, but then I thought about the fact that more than 3 millennia had past and plenty of people seem to be intact, not affected by either by a freaking boulder on top of then, changes in topography or erosion, so it is safe to say that hat the people petrified are really resistant, well except against Tsukasa, but that guy can kill lions and smash rocks with his bare hands so he is an exception.",0
296,Don't forget about the man on the beach that was missing an arm or the girl that Taiju gathered all the pieces of in the first episode. I feel like they're as hard as a regular statue. I think the only reason that girl under the rock wasn't crushed was because the ocean pushed the boulder on top of her over time and it didn't necessarily fall on her.,1
297,"I find it really strange how they seem to become statues entirely made of stone, but dissolving the outer layer brings them back to fleshy life. That really is some fantasy stuff.",1
298,There's some stuff I'm sure we don't understand yet.,1
299,"you mean stuff like the lion punching part?    Or hunting birds jumping 30 feet in the air?    or u know.. other stuff like that...    Not even gonna mention how MC goes to science the shit out of things, then comes the primal adolescent and fucking taints his leather in 1 hour? instead of the usual treatment of 1 month?",0
300,Why are you getting mad at me for a comment made a month ago...?,2
301,u mad bro?,0
302,eh.. wat?,2
303,I'm guessing it's because they'd have to censor stuff if they didn't turn completely to stone tbh.,2
304,"If they returned to flesh when broken, most broken statues would be hollow shells by now.",2
305,They are. There have been several images of broken people and they're all hollow,2
306,"This is my gripe that I expressed last week. Normally I wouldn't bat an eye, because fiction is fiction, sci-fi and fantasy also exists and I enjoy that. But because Senku is so preoccupied with science, it lampshades the unrealistic part of the show.     You can say, everything is science if analyzed sufficiently enough, and I agree with that. However, what they're using to un-petrify the people aren't some fictional compound used against fictional phenomenon. Senku knows the acid-whatever thing he's making, and he should know that it doesn't have that kind of property. How is corroding the outer layer of the petrification magically turn the inner stone into flesh? we see from broken statues that the inner parts are also stone, not some shell on top of flesh. Again, I love fantasy like any other guy, but the character being preoccupied with science and saying how he'd beat fantasy with science breaks the suspension of disbelief a little.",0
307,"Without spoiling, I will say that you are getting ahead of the show, and nothing you are mentioning is not at least addressed in a way that does not treat it as fantasy.    I'll leave the accuracy to those who know better than me, but nothing is left unquestioned and the series does not break with its scientific approach.",1
308,"Hmm, okay then. Thanks for letting me know!",1
309,It will be explained later.,2
310,"  Dr. Stone is a bar of soap.    No, it was the friends we made along the way.",2
311,"TFW you realize that you've been rubbing Dr. Stone all over your body, for all those years...     whatdidijustread",2

314,"I was about to say, every player better be running 3 copies of Danger! Deodorant! these days",2
315,What's the point? Do you want to instantly win tournaments by default?,0
316,"For games like pokemon sure. Free points is free points. Get me one step closer to worlds. Aside from that, still sure. If it teaches some smelly asshole to spend less money on his deck and get some fucking deodorant.",0
317,"No, that's going to make the smelly assholes make their own tournaments comprised entirely of smelly assholes.",0
318,Then they can do that and keep their smelly judges.,0
319,And then no one's left to play the game,2
320,I mean my locals only has one constant that smells bad out of say 15.,2
321,"Like, that part where they were stuck on the vines, I swear that one of her arms would've been cut off or something.",0
322,Getting strong Necalli vibes from Tsukasa lol,1
323,"if they broke Yuzu right off the bat then one of the main characters loses 90% of his motivation. Unfortunately, that also happens if she gets revived and turns into an actual character so... that's probably not happening any time soon.",0
324,"Can a manga reader spoiler me and tell me if Yuzuriha gets waken up and if so if it's gonna happen soon like they planned, or if it'll be a big far off goal for them for a while?",2
325,"there is definitely allot to think about. i can see some dickbag adult being all ""im the adult so im in charge now."" but also if you only revive kids than things will get chaotic fast. if you revive a bunch of elderly people before the infrastructure is in place they will just suffer and not be very productive.     also should consider holding off on reviving a portion of the younger people so that in 40 odd years when the main cast is getting older there is some fresh young blood to carry society on, without having the burden of actually raising children from infants.",1
326,"I don't get why they didn't just leave her and bring clothes to her.    Edit: ooh maybe cuz it's lion territory and they'd have to escape with her anyway but still, she'd be more durable out of stone, if something breaks it can heal.",1
327,Suspicious Tarzan has entered the chat.    I smell an antagonist,2
328,Tarzan just rekt a lion with his two hands .    I think we should keep an eye on him. Maybe it's him the lion.,2
329,"""I wouldn't be  lion  to you guys about my motives right?""",2
330,"Correction: one hand, he friggin oneshot it with a punch",1
331,"Actually I might be remembering wrong, I think he ora ora'd it",2
332,"Kinda redundant at this point, but dear god that OST made that final fight in FFVIII so much better. That game's underrated and I really wish they didn't have to tell so much story via text-exposition and had the disc space and time to tell it properly. Maybe people would regard it more then.",1
333,"Tbh I'm very disappointed. After the 1st episode I was expecting primitive technology youtube channel in anime form    But after all that talk about science and shit in the 1st episode, here we have a highschooler Samson shooing away a lion pride single handedly right on the 2nd episode. Bye bye suspension of disbelief",0
334,"Well... Even with the scientific stuffs later on, while the methods work, require a certain amount of suspension for it to produce the desire product at the desire quality. Or so I'd heard. So, yeah, suspend your disbelief higher than that if you want to enjoy the show.",1
335,"All I smell is how many fucking Seashells Taiju got... seriously, did he not take one break while collecting them? Jesus.",1
336,Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells!,1
337,Some people still state that Taiju is still out there collecting shells.,1
338,at least 10 shells,2
339,"Everybody in this anime is extra as fuck. I thought Tsukasa was going to outshine Taiju with his crazy hunting, then he goes collecting and smashing some hundreds of shells.",1
340,Taiju is singlehandedly going to overfish the shells lol,1
341,Hopefully he kept three of them until they can invent paper.,1
342,Comrade Tarzan,2
343,"Smell? With the shit he said at the end, the man  reeks  of an antagonist. Senku's ballsy to basically tell him ""fuck off, we're reviving everyone no matter what""",2
344,"To be honest though, IMO all the male characters up to now looked like Jojo villains, so I can't even tell if someone is intended to look like they're actually evil, or if it's just the style.",1
345,Reeks of body odor,0
346,"This is why I hate watching OPs now. They make shit way too obvious. Oh no, the guy covered completely in red with murderous intent has just been revived! Oh wait, he looks good right?... No. OP.",0

351,Amazing,1
352,Perfect,1

354,"The guy is strong and all, but Senku is literally the only path to civilization right now. I'd say he holds more power than anyone else.",1
355,only if you want civilization,1
356,since he's the guy who can make more de-petrifier and they seemingly don't have any stockpiled there's still no way past him,2
357,Time is not something this show or manga conveys well. They have to wait for enough bat piss to accumulate to free a new person.,0
358,"He made soap, shelter, de-stoned him and provided everything necessary to live. Not only does macho man owe Senku everything, he understands that Senku is probably his only hope if he gets a minor infection or illness. They need all hands on deck.",1
359,Not to mention they don't have any women de-petrified yet. Until that happens Senku is untouchable since he's likely the only person who knows the formula.,2
360,remember what the nazis druglords protrayed as strong men did with jesse weak genius portrayed as a walking pile of gold in breaking bad? They locked him in a room with chemicals and took his friend as a hoostage to make him work for them.    At the end of the day power is power,2
361,Remember when the terrorists locked Tony stark in a cave with junk to build missiles?    We could go back and forth all day with random examples going both ways.,1
362,"I think ""Senku built insert incredible thing here IN A CAVE! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!"" is basically the only synopsis this whole anime/manga needs.",2
363," We could go back and forth all day with random examples going both ways.      doesn't really apply those low iq arabs didn't get any hostages to make sure he was working properly, and they literally gave a nuclear engineer nuclear elements and tools lmao",1
364,Plus they didn't even have someone in the room like wot,1
365,There’s no real leverage in this scenario though.,2
366,his best friend,2
367,I've only seen two episodes but idk how choked up he'd be losing his best friend. Plus idk how efficient it would be to kill 1/3 of the human race to try and motivate the other 1/3. if he kills the friend then all the work the friend was doing kinda falls on him now if he wants Dr. Dude to be able to accomplish much.,1
368,"Taking a hostage is a different kind of power than muscle strength. You can take a hostage with a gun as well, and you exactly don't need to be a druglord to wield one. Nowadays, in order to acquire power, you need to be smart. Dumb people can never get in power and keep it that way, cause eventually smarter people will take over them.",2
369,"But then Walter killed them with his ingenuity.     Jesse's not a genius. He's good at making meth thanks to Walter and has street smarts, but that's pretty much it.",2
370,He wanted a world that belonged to no one so safe to say the guy doesn't really want civilisation.,2
371,As long as logic prevails sure. Or until Senku gets a foolproof way to counter him.,2
372,"Taking bets on he takes that guys ""girlfriend"" ""hostage"" for the next half cour",1
373,"Thats why I love this set up. Tsukasa doesn't know shit about the revival formula and he knows that even if Taiju did know, he wouldn't drop the info if senku were killed by then. They both know they cant live without the other.",1
374,Senku is the most valuable person on the planet and he is aware of that.,1
375,The ultimate big-dick power move,2
376,I think it's cuz he already has a plan to take him down and made it either between when Tarzan decapitated the guy and confronted him or as soon as he saw him take down a lion. Hence the hidden 4th use of limestone,2
377,"He probably wouldn't survive, or live as luxuriously has he has been without Senku",2
378,Killer a lion with his bare hands and is willing to straight up murder someone who can’t fight back in cold blood,2
379,AYAYAYAYA,2
380,The entire theme song just started playing in my head,1
381, loud music blasts into existence ,1
382,"I really wish Senku stated ""He's Alive!"" when Tsukasa awakened.",1
383,"Ill be honest, I'm really happy how low key show is playing how god damn extra Senku is at heart. He's not wacky off the walls scientists, but he still felt it was a priority to carve a laboratory sign so his house is properly labled.  A few problems I have with Manga adaptations is how the show doesn't translate some of the more subtle story beats that aren't as obvious when the story is in motion. In this case, Senkus twist on being a 'mad' scientist. Its not obnoxious, just sprinkled in the background for those looking for it.",1
384,"Yeah, I can imagine that all he has been doing for so many years is literally been counting, I can see your brain having a few screws loose.",1
385,"Really all three of them should be completely insane. 3700 years assuming Senku isn't pulling that number out of his ass to seem smart glaring into the empty void of nothingness with no stimulation should drive you mad.     Or eventually, like Kars, you'd stop thinking.",2

391,"A bit late, but there are many accounts on the absolute torture of just a short while of solitary confinement from american prisons.",2
392,Yeah especially considering that solitary confinement for more than a few days is considered torture.,2
393,Did you genuinely confused the antagonist tsukasa with Jojo’s Kars or was it on purpose? Either way i think its pretty funny lol,1
394,"He was just referencing the whole ""eventually he stopped thinking"" thing w/ Kars, no swapping/confusing with tsukasa unless I'm being a big dummy",1
395,"That was actually one of my biggest fears for this show when I saw the 'E=mC2' on his shirt, and the massive machine he was playing with in the first episode. I thought he may have been some shitty isekai wizard that spews made-up science. I'm thrilled to see that this show is actually taking a scientific yet not over-the-top approach to his character.",1
396,"Thats what hooked me on the Manga was he is most certainly  not  a wizard. Sure, you know how make PB&Bread - PB - Jelly but to go do it Bear Grills style with nothing but a loin cloth is some next level shit. Manga Spoilers""Bread Arc"".    So remember, every flair/pin/poster/decorative is something he had to plan -  farm -  craft to put it there.",1
397,I really likes the road maps too for every new project,1
398,And also him just casually lighting a bunch of gasoline in a sink in the first episode,1
399,"Yeah I like how the only description I can think for him is ""mad scientist"" but he's literally not one",1
400,Is Tsukasa the antagonist?    I'll be real sad if he is :c,0
401,"I mean, it was really obvious from the beginning that he'd be the villain.     A He's built/looks like a major villain    B Senku mentioned that he would be unstoppable if he wanted to be evil    C He wants to murder billions of people because they might be mean",2
402,It’s extremely foreshadowed,2
403,"As soon as i saw it was the same eery guy in the intro, i was 10billion percent sure he was the villain",1
404,"Right? I was like, hmm, isn't this the guy with the ominous walk from the intro? Isn't he obviously evil?",1
405,I can't think of the last time a character named Shishio was not a villain.,1
406,"Fun fact: Shishiou literally means ""Lion King."" Between this and the reference to his sister loving the Little Mermaid, I feel it might be a reference.",1
407,"Also, I can think of one major hero named Shishioh:    Guy Shishioh, the King of Braves!    Double Hero Points: He's voiced by Nobuyuki Hiyama, who would go on to voice Adult Link in the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.",1
408,"They have weapons in the intro, with two people defending that aren't him, and he's shown walking with the screen toned red. How villainous can you get",1
409," Senku mentioned that he would be unstoppable if he wanted to be evil    ""Let's first revive the people who are hardest to stop if they turn on us"" Geniuth",2
410,"at the time there was seemingly little choice      although they'd been outrunning the lions seemingly fine until that point, soooooooo  ",1
411,Plus the opening,2
412,Also if you just pay attention to the OP it seemed very clear.,1
413,"Also, he appears red on the OP. That's a big villains sign for me",1
414,Don't forget about the entire red background when he's in the op too,1
415,Damn art schools,2

We could choose to live the way you describe tomorrow, but we don't, because we choose not to and for good reasons. The modern large scale attempts to get rid of privatization and have people own everything as one collective ended in tyranny, mass poverty, and some of the worst ecological disasters known to mankind. We didn't end up with the current capitalistic system randomly, we have it because it works better than anything we've tried before. The divide between rich and poor has also always existed, but the poor in modern developed societies live in warm houses, have plenty of entertainments, never go hungry, live long healthy lives and get medical care. Attempts to fix this modern capitalistic system tends to lead to societies where the upper middle class doesn't live as well as the poor do in capitalistic societies.",2
427,"That’s not exactly right though. We could  not  choose to live that way tomorrow because there is a specific cultural legacy we must deal with. For example, private property would need to be expropriated by force; but in a culture in which commons were the norm people would go along with it. Tsukasa isn’t wrong that this IS a chance to completely turn around history. The problem is whether it’s worth the horrific sacrifice he is willing to make for it, or if he can build a better society at all.",2
428," He isn’t content on not waking them    I have to disagree with you here, the person he killed was the fisherman from his story, someone who he had grudge against and was under influence of strong emotions at that moment. But the rest of the adults? He has no reason whatsoever to kill them, he doesn’t seek revenge over the whole mankind. He never said himself that adults should be killed, therefore stating so isn’t groundless      The reason why the system isn’t changing isn’t that it wouldn’t be beneficial. We as humans can’t even  choose  the system they have because the world is ruled by a handful of rich and those who acquired power and it’s convenient for them to make things stay the way they are, because they gain from it. The past systems like socialism or capitalism didn’t work not because of the societies but because of individuals. Communism is a actually a good system but extremely idealistic for the world we live in, since there will always be people who think they deserve more than others. Such system would only work in a small community where peer pressure would take effect. The other systems that have collapsed would also probably work but only under certain circumstances.      What you described as “poor” is actually how people in the middle class live. The real poor people are the ones in slums, in crumbling houses without heating and barely any money to sustain themselves or homeless. Their standard of living is below average, often not because they are at fault. And there are far too many of them. Look at Brasil for example- the society is basically divided between people living in slums, those who live in regular houses or flats and those who own their mansions. But it’s the same for developed European countries or America, the amount of poverty regions and homeless people is honestly horrifying. And then again there are those extremely rich people who can afford to own 10 different sport cars for God knows what sake. How can a system that allows and even supports this state of things be positive?",2
429,"  the person he killed was the fisherman from his story someone who he had grudge against and was under influence of strong emotions at that moment. But the rest of the adults? He has no reason whatsoever to kill them, he doesn’t seek revenge over the whole mankind. He never said himself that adults should be killed, therefore stating so isn’t groundless    It wasn't, btw. It was just a random middle-aged guy. The guy in the flashback and the statue he smashed look nothing alike.    And yes he was about to start killing more. He was literally mid-swing on the next guy until Senku stopped him.",2
430,"Alright, for me they looked kinda similar, but still there is something like “murder with passion” and it happens when a person is under influence of strong emotions. At that time he was. I doubt he is going to do that again since he shouldn’t resent all of the adults, or well, at least I’m hoping the story doesn’t go that way and we’ll see a clash of ideal rather than “we woke up a bad guy oh no now we good guys need to fight him”",1
431,"because its a terribly naive perspective. not waking up the bad guys wont mean all evil will be gone and they'll be in fairyland. and they don't have any property or is there any concept of rich and poor, there is no civilization or government or currency to make it so, everyone's starting from ground zero, infact in their stone world its people like Taiju and Tsukasa that are ""rich"" because of their physical prowess, people who can make others do what they want cause of their strength.",0
432,"I mean of course that doesn’t been all evil will be gone, but many will want to return to the old system they are used to. But same goes for youth. They have a chance to start from scratch and not repeat the mistakes humanity made so far, create a new better system that doesn’t exploit the resources so much and so on",2
433,Creating a better system while considering the past flaws doesn't need you to kill or not save the old people. They have no power anyway.,2
434,"But as of now he is sentencing everyone over a certain age, assuming that young people themselves wont do exactly that, he is behaving like a tyrant.",2
435,"Yeah, and that is a mistake, bc what he says about young people being pure-hearted is bullshit. It’s not like his thinking is faultless, but the sole ideal of creating a world without privatization and a new system is good in itself",1
436,Can’t they not revive the bad boomers but revive the good ones?,2
437,"The problem is, nobody knows which ones from milliards of humans are good and which are bad. The same goes to adults and youth too. When he says that the youth is still pure-hearted is bullshit, some of them shouldn’t be revived as well if he wants a stainless society. The best thing that can be done is to revive just a few and create a society from that with new ideals.",1
438,The killing people stuff is stupid but without it he is 100% a good person.    Like unironically even with the killing stuff the sort of world he wishes to create is good.,1
439,a lot of good villains want to do good from their perspective.,1
440,"Yes, finally somebody who gets it",1
441,Do you like... watch the show?,2
442,"Still, why confirm it? This serves me as a reminder yet again to never read r/anime discussion threads lol",1
443,It's not like he spoiled anything. Tsukasa is definitely the villain - it's even blatantly hinted at in the opening/,2
444,"I don't even watch openings because so many openings spoil stuff, uh I'm just gonna turn notifications off now",0
445,Careful subaru dies,0
446,"That's your own judgemental mistake. The PVs and the opening makes it very clear this guy ain't good. And no I'm not gonna use the source material discussion, cause I'm not discussing about the source here.",0
447,"That's your fault for not watching, cause it was meant to be watched before the show, that's how TV shows work.",0
448,Amazing,1
449,Had you not  seen  the ominous as fuck OP?,2
450,"I haven't read the manga so I don't know anymore than you, but I thought this episode made it pretty clear he was going to be an antagonist.    That anarcho-primitivist eugenics spiel he went on wasn't exactly subtle.",1
451,this edit spoiled the shit out of me,1
452,"He is obviously going to be a villain though. It’s mentioned that he is too strong. And he wants to kill everyone who isn’t young, so that should be a red flag.",1
453,Ahhhhh come onnnn this is r/anime not r/manga,0
454,"I haven’t read the manga, I just assumed that he’s the antagonist because he wants to kill everybody but the youth. And it’s even said that he’s “too strong” for them.",1

456,"And your edit spoiled me, nice.",2

459,"Actually you're the first person to confirm it, I took it as a joke cause they stone pillar manned a super buff murder dude",0
460,"Yeah I was actually joking, I haven’t even touched the manga",1
461,"Damn, I just love that right from the start one could tell that Tsukasa was going to be troublesome based on his appearance alone. But killing a fucking lion, and destroying boulders barehanded? Hopefully, that fourth thing that can be made with those shells is some weapon as that guy is unstoppable at this point.",1
462,my assumption is gunpowder,2
463,"Gunpowder doesn’t require calcium carbonate, and you would have to go out of your way to make gunpowder using it.    Gunpowder needs Potassium Nitratecan get it from bat shit, sulfurthere’s a Volcanic valley in Japan relatively near Tokyo where sulfur can be aquired, and Charcoalextremely easy, it’s essentially just charred wood    This is just speculation but the 4th use he is alluding to May be the purification of iron ore to Iron in a blast furnace where the calcium carbonate forms a slag with the impurities from the iron ore, leaving the Iron mostly purified and in a state useful for weapons.",2
464,"this guy steels      I wasn't sure because I'd been seeing the gunpowder alternative, but civilization wise the production of steel is absolutely essential",2
465,Correct 10 billion points to you.,1
466,.......I don't see how weapons are going to help much when they're untrained with them and they're literally up against a guy who kills lions and breaks boulders with his bare hands...,0
467,"I mean, I would prefer to have a weapon rather than fight him unarmed.",1
468,Mine's rubber.,2
469,"  fourth        It's explosives, the powder can be used as an explosive.",2
470,"senku builds a crossbow while they sleep, maybe the shells were a part of that...",2
471,"I knew Tsukasa was gonna be an issue when he wakes up from stone and his first words are ""What's the situation?"" That is not the reaction  of a sane person.",1
472,"Well, he made a crossbow to go along with whatever that 4th thing is...so...logically it will probably be something to put on the tip of an arrow right?    Senku is also just really smart, so he'll eventually make most things we had in the modern era.",1
473,My guess is that it'll become a form of gun powder,2
474,"Don't you just love it when the new guy starts ranting about the abuses of the ruling senior class, suggests the establishment of a new anarchic civilization, and contemplates the killing or at least not bringing back to life of an entire age group due to perceived impurities?     I'm not being sarcastic nor am I slaying the show. The new guy seems really interesting.",1
475,"And I love that he needs Stone to make his wish come true, so it's not like killing him and he definitely can will do any good, also he needs to learn everything he can from stone, and using torture or whatever isn't gonna do it for now. He has to play along with stone and somewhat outsmart him.    Also the better way for him to prosper is reviving someone as clever as Stone, and he probably can assuming he knows the people of their school and of course they will find a way to locate them even after 3000 years",1
476,"The one flaw in this plan is the ""as clever as Stone"" part. I don't think such a person exists. You need someone with an encyclopedic knowledge of every scientific process, because all the reference books have rotted away.",1
477,"I said that because the lab stone was on episode one was full of scientists, so he could persuade one in the process. Of course not with his knowledge but at least someone with high IQ",2
478,"No one on the level as Senkuu though, He's got basically all of science explored by mankind ingrained in his brain",2
479,"He is the ultimate scientist, It's awesome that I can entertain myself and learning useful things I neglected in school LOL",1
480,Who is Stone? Are your referring to Senku?,2
481,Nah. He obviously means the soap.,1
482,yeah I was fixed in that name it's dope though that's the same as calling Gon by Hunter every time. My bad.,1
483,"It's a really interesting dynamic they're setting up here.     Tsukasa has a valid point that bringing back the old world means restoring its injustices as well, and they have a real opportunity here to make something better. Senku is a scientific genius, but he may not be considering the social and political ramifications of his actions. He may be the  de facto  leader right now, but not everyone they revive is going to respect that. The adults especially are not going to want to submit to a child.     Senku, on the other hand, rightly objects to Tsukasa's extreme methods. He also realizes that choosing not to revive someone if they have the ability to is essentially murder-by-omission. Senku also has at least  some  social awareness, being able to motivate Taiju and recognizing that Tsukasa may be a threat. He may be able to come up with a decent plan now that he is aware of the problems.",1
484,"I love it because like all good antagonists and radicals, he's partially right! A libertarian in the traditional sense, not in the American sense, i.e. non-Authoritarian society WOULD be better and would be much harder to pull off if you revive the corrupt oligarchs and powers-that-be, but of course his MEANS involve murdering said powers that be. Is it justified political violence or crossing over into the realm of purification based on one's views?    That's the ideology of a top notch antagonist, I'm PUMPED to see where it goes!",1
485," A libertarian in the traditional sense, not in the American sense, i.e. non-Authoritarian society    The usual term in political science is anarchist.     For the others: contrary to popular belief, anarchism isn't about absolute chaos, but about the elimination of hierarchy. This includes social hierarchy e.g. of a government over its citizens, of one race/gender over another, of one nationality over another and economic hierarchy e.g. of employer over employee, of capitalist over worker, of rich over poor. For this reason, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists are generally not considered anarchists, as they advocate for economic hierarchy.    If you want to find out more about anarchism, I would suggest /r/anarchy101, ""Anarchy Works"" by Peter Gelderloos, or ""The Conquest of Bread"" by Peter Kropotkin.",2
486,  but of course his MEANS involve murdering said powers that be.    Technically not if you just never revive them.,2
487,I accidentally went and binged the entire manga after seeing the first episode    We in for a gooooood fuckin time.,1
488,  I accidentally went and binged the entire manga    hate it when that happens     taigasigh,0
489,it happened to me too.,2
490,Is the manga complete? I didn’t look up the show before watching to avoid spoilers and just finished episode two. Is this probably going to be a very long anime or relatively short you think based on manga?,2
491,I think you replied to the wrong person - the manga reader was the parent comment to mine.,2
492,"Nope, the manga isnt complete but you can read other words by the mangaka - Bochi.     Just be careful you dont end up in the hentai section, since he does draw hentai at one point and you probably realized by now that most of the female drawn by him looks like pornstar.",1

532,Really thought Yuzuriha was going to get revived this episode.,1
533,After the first episode I thought that she won't be revived until the very end,1
534,"Which is really dumb imo. I feel like Taiju is going to constantly stop every attempt at reviving her because it's not ""perfect"" yet. Like ""She doesn't have any clothes!"" then ""She needs a bed/room first!"" and ""What if she wants to try her favorite food when she gets revived! We need to develop that first!"" I really hope I'm wrong about it though because Senku should beat the logic into him about that not being more important than her life.     If that's not the reason why, then my guess is that Tarzan is going to fight with Senku over genociding the adults. Senku says no. Tarzan kills all the bats and destroys the only current method of reviving people. The rest of the characters in the OP are other people who revived on their own and the main characters just run into them over time.",0
535,"She will be sad if she finds out her headphones are useless, we must invent electronics first!",0

540,"Speaking of which, those must be some ecologically-dangerous headphones if they fully don’t decay even after 3700 years.    Damn, plastics.",1
541,"Well, I assume that Tarzan wants to revive people as well as long as they are not adults or something so I think we are safe with him not trying to kill the bats. They also will probably find another way to free people as the bat poop stuff seems like it would take too long to get enough of it to rebuild civilization.  But yeah I also hope that reviving her isn't posponed because of stupid reasons but judging on the fact that she isn't really seen much in the OP I assume thats what is going to  happen.",1
542,All the bats?    Good luck to him,1
543,"I wouldn't be surprised if he just sets up camp in the cave, after they figure out why he is so damn extra.",1
544,"I think her revival is gonna get put off because there are literally more useful people then her, and situations are gonna keep appearing where those people are need at that moment.",1
545,  Senku should beat the logic into him    I honestly don't think Senku gives a shit about what Taiju wants or doesn't want.,1
546,I was more thinking they'll keep finding someone who is more important to revive for survival purposes,1
547,Don't worry he isn't THAT dumb,1
548,Not the focus of the show.,2
549,"Why? They created the cure at the end of the first episode so the next step is to revive people. Obviously Taiju is gonna want to revive the girl who he loves so much he didn't stop thinking about her for 3,700 years, plus they know exactly where she is. She's one of very few people they actually know and know where they are.",1
550,"It was said that Senku and Taiju were revived because they were conscious during all these time. Maybe Tsukasa too. Birds are simple creatures, so it is easier to revive them. So, my theory was that when they decide to revive Yuzuriha, something would go wrong because she wasn't conscious duting all this time or she would lose her memories after revival or something like that. Also, she was in OP only in the flashbacks from 3700 years ago, and Taiju was very sad during the OP, so that's why I thought that she won't be revived.",2

602,Just because someone is a murderer doesn't mean he is evil. It means he simply believes the end justifies the means. If anything he is an antagonistic idealist who believes a utopia can exist if old people are  removed from the equation.,2
603,"he just wanted to kill a random old person, that is evil. It was no reason for him to wanting to kill the second old man not like Senku was at the moment trying to free him etc.    So no that is evil.     He is an ageist that wants to kill every person who is ""old"" becasue they are automatically bad in his view. Obviously it exist old people who dont fit his ideal of them as well as can be REALLY USEFUL for them. But he wants to kill them all because of their age, ergo evil again.",2
604,It wasn't just a random old guy. It was the old guy who beat him up when he was younger,2
605,u do realize he wanted to KILL 2 people right. It was not 2 old men in the flashback,2

So in his mind. Many old people are evil so it is easier to not revive any adults than to risk reviving a bad one.     Sure, extreme and short sighted but he wants to protect the weak children from evil selfish adults.",2

616,"Killing all Germans would still be genocide. Yes, in his mind adults are evil so he wants them all dead, just like in the mind of any evil person their victims are the truly evil ones. He himself is evidence that sticking to only reviving young people will not protect the weak from evil, because 1 out of the only 3 revived people is already a murderer and a massive threat to the other two.",2
617,tx for the spoiler,1
618,"im speculating, 10/1 is a form of saying 10 to 1, in other words, a bet.",2
619,We need to revive Machio stat,2
620,If he can destroy a full tracksuit with just his side muscles he can bust out of stone no problem.,2
621,"He probably was the first to break out, but we haven't seen him yet because he's been working out. Gotta keep up with the training routine!",2
622, Reviving Hibiki    Do you want to run out of food? That's how you run out of food.,2
623,What the Dr. Stone gang hasn't realized is that they're in the one spot on the planet that Machio hasn't converted into a gym yet.,2
624,You two just had to jinx the whole thing by talking about “how bad it would be if you unleashed a murderer first thing”. Well now you’ve got something arguably worse: a genocidal nut whose only wants to revive the young and “pure-hearted” while killing the older people who are supposedly “tainted”. Oh and he can kill a lion with his bare hands.     Though I can understand what he’s talking about. I wouldn’t be at all shocked to see some old man get revived and try to claim property rights still need to be respected even though it’s been 3700 years.,1
625,I mean-is he really wrong?,1
626,"His thinking is far more wrong than right, bundling together everyone in his judgment just based on age is extremely flawed. There are plenty of average older people out there that haven't done anything wrong. Think of how many kind doctors, teachers, skilled laborers, and more that would benefit everyone, but just because they're older they deserve to die/not be brought back. If the dude could kill a lion with his bare hands then he should just help revive everyone and if someone turns out rotten, it's not like he can't get rid of them himself.",2
627,"Honestly that's where his logic is fucked up. If he's the boy in the story and I'm assuming with how he told it then, he knows older people, good older people were doing surgery on his sister. In a stone world, with no modern conveniences, like it or not he'd have to eventually admit ""maybe we need doctors"" because Senku can't damn well do everything!",0
628,"If I understood the story correctly, his sister died, so those doctors didn't do anything more for his sister than Senku could.",2
629,"Either way, that's a load of pressure to put on Senku. I don't doubt he could but that's a lot of work OAo",2
630,What I meant was Tsukasa never got anything positive from adults so it's completely understandable and logical that he sees adults as absolutely negative people.,1
631,"Yep. I agree with him on ""humans are fundamentally evil"", but if he thinks grouping by age is gonna help he's a fucking idiot. Kids are often just as twisted as adults on average, and many younger ones haven't had a chance to begin developing a system of morals beyond self-fulfillment. Its a crapshoot either way.",1
632,"Nah, humans are fundamentally good. We only think we're evil because we see this things that  other animals do and think it's bad. The fact that we even think about that stuff, let alone act in a way to minimize it, means that we're one of, if not, the most good aligned animals on the planet. Lions don't care if their prey is alive or dead when eating them, Sharks don't question whether it's ethical to eat a baby seal, and Deer don't think about their impact on the environment.    Humans are good, we're just so good that we see our tiny imperfections as the ultimate evil.",1
633,"That is actually a very interesting take. I always thought with humans are neutral and are kind of dicks because we accidentally developed a society that encourages dickishness, but yours is an in my opinion really good argument for why humans are good, as well as why we don't think we are. Thank you good sir!",1
634,  humans are fundamentally evil    What now lmao,1
635,"Human morality is a longstanding topic in philosophy. The ""fundamental evil"" argument says that we create societies, laws, and civilization to survive and prosper, even as they go against our base instincts. Morality is a learned behavior, not an ingrained one.    Tsukasa was saying something slightly different, that greed and corruption is the natural state as you get older. But he didn't really say how or why that happens. He didn't really seem to have any reasoning to back up his argument, but who needs reason when you can kill a lion with a single punch?",2
636,"Well, he's still a highschooler. He's not mature enough to think that ahead.",2
637,"Kids are evil an an edgy way and because they think it's cool and that can be correctes. Adults are evil in a bitter, disgusting way because being evil and merciless benefits them and they stay like that forever.",0
638,"So, to be on the safe side, better kill both adults and kids, got it.",2
639,"No, only adults because you can no longer correct their behaviour.",2
640,"the problem is that solution goes out the window once scale comes into play. he could be the police force and judge-jury-executioner for a small village, but as soon as there are enough people he loses his ability to determine who lives and dies.      also our mad scientist is definitely not going to go around invididually reviving people in his immediate area forever if the end goal is ""everyone"" - he's gonna have to make a system to spread that shit around the entire world somehow, which will DEFINITELY means society sorta tries to revert back to how it was...",2
641,"I also just think he fundamentally wants a system where strongest is the king rather for any other reason. Sure, it sucks when ""kings"" are mostly there because of exploiting others or through nepotism, but when you think about - doesn't it make more sense that he simply wants what he is best at to be the criteria for social standing?",2
642,"What makes you think that he wants such a system. To me it seems he doesn’t want any kind of system, he just doesn’t want the land to be privatized and exploited by a group of people that think they have rights to do that. I don’t see any intend of being the ruler really.",2
643," To me it seems he doesn’t want any kind of system    That's what aspiring rulers would say. Of course he wouldn't outright proclaim that he's their new dictator right away, if he's smart about it. But it's hard to know so far.",2
644,"You know that not everybody wants power right? Some genuinely want to make things better and don’t have any ulterior motif. That’s the vibe I’m getting from him. I’ll be very disappointed if the show makes a turn in the direction you’re predicting   especially that he actually thinks about he well-being of humanity and Senku is just being selfish and self-serving, nothing more  ",2
645,   I’ll be very disappointed if the show makes a turn in the direction you’re predicting    I give it three weeks before he carves a throne for himself with his fists.,0
646,"Yes? But I also know that he's a genuine psychopath by now. That doesn't bode well. Psychopaths don't generally shy away from any methods to get what they want, something he's already partially demonstrated.",0
647,He's asserting his own system by wanting to kill what he sees fit.,0
648,"That, and there's nothing stopping good kids from growing up into bad people.",0
649,"Kids grow up into bad people because they are surrounded by bad people. If kids grew up without the influence of emotionally-dead adults who only ever think about their own benefit, it's far more likely they'll grow up to be good people.",2
650,Kids also have the tendency to be selfish assholes even when raised under the best circumstances. All it'll take is for a few of them to keep getting away with being dicks before it gets ingrained in them that it's okay to behave that way. After enough time humanity would be right back where it stared.,2
651,You can't keep kids away from bitter adults unless you completely isolate them from the outside world meaning there never was a kid raised under the best circumstances. Also if some of the kids start acting like dicks they can figure out what to do about it when it happens but that's still miles better than reviving people who already are dicks.,2
652,I don’t think the mere absence of bad people is enough. I think they need good people to model themselves after.,2
653,"I absolutely agree and they have Senku, Taiju, Tsukasa and Yuzuriha for that.",1
654,"I think all the ""property rights"" is meaningless.    Law exists only when the collective agrees on it and there is a body that enforces it.    If you trespassed and ""stole"" a piece of land from your neighbor, you'll go to court.    But in a stone world with no police, no lawyers, no government and no army, even if some old man claims ""This is my land!"" He can do nothing to enforce it. Tsukasa can forcibly drive him out or even kill him.",2
655," But in a stone world with no police, no lawyers, no government and no army, even if some old man claims ""This is my land!"" He can do nothing to enforce it.    If every boomer is brought back, there will be that State. Comrade Shishisou knows this, and is trying to liberate the future before this takes place.",2
656,"""But muh sister and seashells and mermaids!""",2
657,"Eh, I mean, property rights only make sense in the context of a greater society that guarantees them. It's really stupid to start staking claims to land or resources in a world in which there still is no police or state of any sort to verify those claim, or make them valid. In addition it'd also be pretty selfish in such a post-apocalyptic context.     So by all means, do that, but don't complain when everyone else says ""no"" and still takes what the fuck they want and need.",2
658,"I mean thats where the moral divergence comes in. Like Yeah Tsukasa takes it too far assuming every adult is evil, but he has a point. There are definitely adults who would try and fuck things up for their greed. And in those cases, do you free those people. For example, do you free Donald Trump? Hes a manipulative controlling asshole that would be let into a world without an economy. But he is still humankinda and is it alright to destroy his statue? Of course this show will go more into that later.",2
659,"It depends I guess.     At this point in their society they really only want to revive people who have skills and can help build a civilization.     People who are motivated by greed, pure self interest, or evil/mental illness aren’t going to help. Nor will people who are infirm in some way.     But making a hard and fast rule, especially since they don’t have much of a way to confirm before they wake them up is not a good way to act. Nor is rejecting outright modern concepts like property rights. Eventually that will be needed if you really want to build a modern civilization. A bunch of life free or die types aren’t going to make money or space programs.",2
660,He's right that it's a bad idea to blindly revive people who could be a detriment to a fragile budding society. He's wrong to arbitrarily make decisions based on shallow characteristics like age.,2
661,"Imagine you find your grandparents, and then he goes and smashes the hell out of them because they are too old?    I think he may be going a bit too far on his reasoning.",0
662,"He absolutely is.    I'm not trying to suggest that modern society is in any way perfect, but it's  really, really good  compared to the alternative. It's the culmination of thousands of years of trial and error, different societal structures being tried, failing, and then new ones taking their place, until finally we've landed on one that works, and doesn't result in people slaughtering each other or starving to death every other week.    So, logically speaking, if you're attempting to revive society, you have one of two choices:    1. Try to restore society back to the way it was as closely as possible, or    2. Throw all of that conventional wisdom out the window, and try to reform society into what ""you"" believe to be an ideal society.    Which of these two options is more likely to actually succeed?    Let me put this another way. Let's say that Senku decided, instead of attempting to recreate the scientific achievements of past humankind, he was going to try to come up with his own ideas and try to think of brand new inventions that have never been tried before to solve all of the existing problems. How do you think that would turn out for him? About as well as trying to reform government all by yourself would. Better to stick to what's been proven to work.",1
663,Yes. Genocide is wrong. Killing innocent people just because they are older is wrong. Shouldn't even have to be said.,2
664,The alternative would be just leaving their statues be and never reviving them but then there always remains a danger that someone will revive them in the future and thus bring the better new world to the shitty state it used to be in. So I think Tsukasa is doing the smart thing killing them all now when he has the chance because either they remain in stone for the rest of eternity in which case there's no difference whether they kill them or not or they get revived and fuck up the whole thing they created.,1
665,He a punched a man's head off.,2
666,The old man or the antagonist?        Because the old man isn't really wrong        The antagonist yeah,2
667,"There's no possible way someone could claim their old property after all this time. The entire world is different, right down to the property. Maybe you used to own a field somewhere guy, but it's gone, sorry.  The whole concept of a modern economy and property is probably gonna have to take a back seat for a long while till they get a certain level of development and a certain number of people.",2
668,"Oh for sure but you just know some dick head wouldn't get with the program and start pulling property rights out as if they still meant something.  That on it's own is a bit silly but if you get them doing something, like say recruiting others by promising them a cut of the land/resources, it could shake stuff up to the point where it threatens the general well being of the up and coming civilization.",2
669," Oh for sure but you just know some dick head wouldn't get with the program and start pulling property rights out as if they still meant something.    And that dude is going to find himself worse off for doing so because there is nothing of value on the property he wants to claim anyway, while all his prospects of surviving is with the new society the Dr. Stone gang is setting up. Trying to act within the bounds of a civilization that's no longer there isn't going to get in the way of the new civilization, it'll just be self destructive for the guy who tries.",0
670,"Very true but it would be kind of funny, maybe a good gag character, and given some of the people I've interacted with not completely unexpected.",1
671,"Will occur but not at current population levels.   But property rights will be needed to avoid fights over who gets to grow what where, who gets to hunt what and were.   As far as old rights are concerned you have to state the former government has fallen and our new government has no obligation to recognize old property rights assigned but being clear this a one time thing and new property right when time to grant them comes will be respected.  Communism works best for a small tribe group like current with no real wealth to divide. Communism is how a hunter gather tribe works so all humans were Communists originally probably why fairness instinct is so strong but that starts breaking down as things get more complex and each member of the groups productivity no longer daily measured by everyone else. Capitalism only required once area's farmed exceed easy walk from tribe base, division of labor starts to occur and wealth starts being generated by trading with other tribe groups.",2
672,"I meant Tsukasa. Old man was definitely wrong and cruel. Tsukasa don't want to kill anyone, he just don't want to revive people because they're bad. I'm definitely on his side",1
673," Tsukasa don't want to kill anyone    He literally murdered a guy in the episode. And how the fuck do you determine who's ""good"" enough to be revived?",0
674,agreed... lmao i can't believe people are actually defending the guy. is tsukasa just going to walk around and kill every adult-looking person?    he is way too edgy for me,0
675,No he literally want to smash all their head. He was going to do it again.,2
676,Yeah wtf dont wanna kill anyone my ass.    Senku saw how he was putting his lion killing fist into that dude's head.,0
677,Oh god we are getting into death penalty politics,0
678,"Uh no? It’s all about not privatizing the land again and demanding the money for it. The Earth was initially a place for everybody to live, every organism had the same amount of rights to its sources. Only humans were shitty enough to claim it and make it their own",2
679,You know cats mark theyr territory by pissing on it. A gazelle would never hang out somewhere where a lion resides. This is all basic instinct.....,2
680,"Yes, but in the world of animals it never happens that somebody privatizes a huge piece of land, divides it and demands money from other individuals of their species to pay them to have the right to live on one of those divided pieces. If somebody has a house which they built themselves let’s say then this is his private possession and if it’s just enough for their own needs then it’s normal that they don’t want to let anybody in, privacy is one of the basic human rights and they worked for it. The point is, one should be able to do business with empty land that initially belongs to everybody",2
681,"Rather than focusing on developing agriculture or even better tools, they start right away with developing the death penalty.    This is top-down society construction.",2
682,"If it were really top-down, Senku would have listened to Taiju and gotten started on a smartphone.",2
683,"I don't think it's about whether Tsukasa is doing the right/wrong thing. The problem to me does not lie in the fact that he is discriminating against all old people - but that HE thinks HE is the one who deserves to make the choices on who lives and who dies.      ;    Although the pragmatic argument for not killing all older people because they could be useful is also strong, I think the principled argument about who deserves the right to choose who lives and dies is much more interesting.",2
684,"Yes, genocide is indeed wrong.",1
685,I like how the writer gave him good ideology... and then basically just made him interpret it in the dumbest way possible so he could be an antagonist.    Like it just feels forced as hell.,1
686,"But I love the battle of wits, they're setting their visions at episode 2, may the followers decide the world's fate.",1
687,"But a world where you don't have to worry about all that stuff, and everyone works together to not die to a super murderer does sound exciting.",1
688,What he is unaware of is there are fossils of man killing man before man was even sapiens. Certainly people fought over who controls the best hunting spots and resources along with fighting over Alpha status.     Probably not a problem this generation as they got plenty of spread out room so fighting for territory less likely but still vary possible over which area is better or just a matter of pride.     Older people especially males way less likely to fight over status and pride than younger and older more practical less likely to get into perfection vs what is achievable problems. A good mix is nessasary.  That older guy who beat him up good chance he did not own that area he just wanted excuse to beat someone up. Boy was not collecting something valuable. Anyway one purpose of property rights is so you have the law enforce things so people don't take things into their own hands.     Although Communism will work better for the group until the wealth level rises above a minimum. Primitive tribes are Communistic and it works all work for common good but there is no real wealth to fight over and no need to divide farm land yet. Once you get into agriculture and divisions of labor communism starts breaking down when something other than direct observation of your fellow tribe member's work is no longer possible.,2
689,Expected Tsukasa to be a straight-up psycho. Turns out he's an anarcho-primitivist. That's much worse.,0
690,Senku there's some lovely filth down here!,1
691,"those are not anarcho-primitivists, they are an Anarcho-Syndicalist commune.    And justto be clear Tsukasa isn’t an Anprim either, he’s more like somebody took a Maoist and then hyped the cultural revolution aspect up to 11",2
692,"def not a maoist but a fascist. maoism is marxist materialism insofar that it doesnt want to purify the society via exterritorializing what you assess as ""impure"" - instead it sees ""impurity"" greed, egoism, posessiveness etc. as the very logic of capitalist production. these necessities which they are under current relations of production are then just mirrored psychologically because hey - we live in a society.",2
693,What the  hell  are you talking about? Repeating this ad nauseam all over this thread isn't going to magically have it make any sense.,0
694,"Basically, and I'll say this right now I don't agree with him, Maoists believe that the reason why people are greedy, egotistic, possessive more or less vaguely bad is because we live in a capitalist system which incentives people to be those things. Concepts like private property, hierarchies, capital, all encourage people to compete with each other by giving those who 'win' significantly better lives and more chances to mate than others, and competition results in above traits, since those traits are adaptive towards success in competition.     If however we lived in a Maoist utopia, people won't be 'bad', because the incentives to be bad will no longer exist.    How would this work? Something something 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need' and mumble mumble Maoist communes mumble mumble voila, a system where greed, egotism, possessiveness, are all gone!    There are a lot of assumptions built into the world view, and quite a few... gaps in the replacement they envision, but thats the basics of Maoist thought.",2
695,Agreed a sane person believing in insane dogma fanatically which makes them sort of insane but in a way more organized and effective way.,1
696,Banality of Evil,2
697,"He's def an anarchist, but primitivist? He made it sound like he's down to advance society, just without who he considers the poison and without Capitalism, etc.    Did he explicitly say he wanted to keep the world retrograde too?",0
698,"He says ""we'll live in a natural world owned by no one"" and calls the stone world a paradise. I guess he could be okay with some advancement as long as they remain respectful of nature, but my guess is that he'll only be okay with basic stone age technology.",1
699,"Of course he is! He can punch a lion to death! If you could murder the alpha predator with your bare hands, you'd think anarcho-primitivism is a great idea too!",1
700,How can it be worse than capitalism or socialism,2
701,The mass genocide as a fundamental part of the system is kinda bad.,2
702,"i dont know what system you mean by that, but looking at hundreds of years of most brutal capitalist colonialism, imperialist war and the ongoing exploitation of the third world... idk man.",0
703,But it's not a fundamental part of it. You can argue that profit as main motivator leads to such things but to begin this primitive world the antagonist wants you need to start with mass genocide. It's much closer to facism which most would agree it's worse than communism and capitalism.,2
704," It's much closer to facism which most would agree it's worse than communism    Communism is a far more murderous ideology than fascism. Not to mention, Fascism and Mussolini were an ideology and a man also heavily influenced by Marxism.",2
705,"  Fascism and Mussolini were an ideology and a man also heavily influenced by Marxism.    In the sense that fascism is pretty explicitly anti-Marxist, and fascism's rise in popularity is the result of middle and upper class folk trying to find a way to crush the working people's aspirations for liberty, sure, fascism was influenced by Marxism.    In the same way the KKK was heavily influenced by black people getting the right to vote, as the KKK specifically formed in response to the threat black voters had to the white supremacist power structure in the south.    The KKK lynched black folk to intimidate them away from voting, because they believed that black voters would bring Republican governments, which would bolster support for more radical elements of Reconstruction. Similarly, some of the first actions taken by Italian fascists was to attack socialist politicians and union leaders, as working class folk had been making major gains in local elections in various parts of Italy and, as a result, were threatening the established order that fascists and the parasites they sided with wanted to protect.",2
706," In the sense that fascism is pretty explicitly anti-Marxist    No it isn't. Disagreements, and even violent disagreements between different kinds of socialists/marxists, was not at all uncommon. Everybody wanted to believe they had the right kind of socialism. You're objectively wrong. And it makes the rest of your little history lesson on the KKK utterly pointless and irrelevant. Why you decided to go on that tangent, I have seriously no idea.     black folk    As a side note: Why do you people talk like this? ""Folk."" Are you a politician or very old? The uniformity of language of certain ideological leanings is very off putting to me. I don't know when it was decided that you would start using that word and appropriate that way of speaking so often or why. Instead of using more common words like ""people."" Very bizarre.",2
707,"  Everybody wanted to believe they had the right kind of socialism.    A key goal of fascist movements was achieving harmony among the social classes, whereas socialist movements are about the liberation of the working class from the tyranny and parasitism of the upper classes that live on their backs. Ideologically, they are completely opposed to each other.    Fascism was a defense mechanism of the liberal capitalist order, it was an authoritarian means for the upper class to crack down on the working class who were beginning to threaten their position of power.    That is why the KKK example is relevant. They were both reactionary movements, made up of those privileged by the status-quo, who felt their undeserved influence and luxury were being threatened by social change.",2
708,"  Ideologically, they are completely opposed to each other.    You keep saying this. There are many different kinds of Marxism that are VERY opposed to one another. To the point of extreme violence. Again, it's among the most murderous ideologies, if not the most murderous.     Fascism was a defense mechanism of the liberal capitalist order    Lol fuckin what? Fascism is definitely opposed to liberalism. And so is Communism, btw. This is complete nonsense.     That is why the KKK example is relevant.    It really isn't.",2
709,"  To the point of extreme violence.    Leftists are a contentious bunch, no doubt, but you are completely overstating the ideological differences between leftist tendencies to try and relate them to a non-leftist, non-socialist ideology like fascism.    The difference between a typical Marxist and an Anarchist is a matter of the role and meaning of the State. To Anarchists, the State itself is an unjust form of authority and hierarchy, it is itself a source of oppression, and, as such, to Anarchists the worker's revolution must also be against the state alongside the capitalist class. Marxists, however, view the state as nothing more than a tool, a creation of class conflict that exists to regulate class struggle in the interests of whichever class is in control of it. As such, to Marxists the worker's revolution is not against the state, and, in fact, seizing control of it should be a major goal of the revolution, because the state can be a valuable tool in advancing the interests of the working class.    But despite that difference, both Anarchists and Marxists still seek the empowerment and liberation of the working class.    The inter-Marxist conflicts, primarily the issue of Trotsky vs. Stalin is more about how the revolution should continue after the working class seize control of the state. In the simplest terms, Trotsky believed the Soviet Union should be geared towards immediately seeking to spread the revolution, to continue the revolutionary momentum and avoid stagnation, while Stalin believed it was necessary to build up the Soviet Union so that it could withstand any reactionary movement against them like, y'know, the eventual invasion of fascist rats before it could begin to even think about exporting the revolution. To further that divide, Trotsky ended up viewing the Soviet Union under Stalin as a ""degenerated workers' state"", where the dictatorship of the proletariat had been taken over by a bureaucratic clique, effectively taking control of the so-called ""workers' state"" away from the workers, and so Trotsky began calling for a political revolution in the Soviet Union, to remove Stalin and his clique and restore control to the working class. Of course, around the time that started happening, fascists started mobilizing and, with the help of their nations bourgeois figures, winning, and so those who were pro-Stalin started viewing Trotsky as an opportunist who was attempting to weaken the Soviet Union for the benefit of the fascists and we all know how that ended up.    But both factions, despite their different views on how it should be achieved, were working towards the empowerment and liberation of the working class.    Then there's, of course, the Maoist thing, but Maoism was effectively an evolution of Marxist-Leninism based primarily around China's large peasant class, rather than the ""industrial proletariat"" because China was even less industrialized than Russia, and yadda yadda. There was the Sino-Soviet split, but that was a matter of competing spheres of influence and the belief that the Soviet Union had fallen under the control of revisionists who wanted to peacefully co-exist with the capitalist west, instead of continuing to push the revolution as they should have.    But, again, despite all of that, the basis of the socialist movement remained the same: the liberation of the working people.    The differences and splits between tendencies within the socialist movement are nothing compared to the difference between ""liberate the working class"" and ""further subjugate the working class for the benefit of the rich and powerful"". Class is  the  most important factor. Fascists are not on the side of the working class, they are on the side of the ruling class. Socialists are on the side of the working class, and are completely opposed to any ruling class.      Fascism is definitely opposed to liberalism    Fascism is a defense mechanism of the liberal order, they want to protect the hierarchical systems and structures that were built up for the benefit of the liberal bourgeois ruling class. However, the ideals of liberalism do not always protect the dominance of the liberal bourgeoisie. The expansion of voting rights to all people includes the working class, who, given the ability to vote for their own interests, were beginning to vote for things that harmed the ill-gotten and undeserved luxuries of the bourgeoisie, they were beginning to vote for social democrats and socialists. This made the ideals of liberalism a fundamental threat to the liberal order.    It's like.. How the US likes to overthrow democracies that vote in people that don't bow down to the western capitalist power structure. It goes against the ideals of liberalism and democracy, but they do so to protect the dominance of the liberal capitalist order that dominates the world. And so, despite the history of anti-democratic and anti-human actions committed by the US, they are still hailed by the liberal West as the ""Leaders of the Free World"". They are, in the eyes of the liberal bourgeoisie, a necessary evil to protect The Way Things Are from the threat of social progress and change.",2
710," Leftists are a contentious bunch, no doubt    Communists are a murderous bunch.     but you are completely overstating the ideological differences between leftist tendencies to try and relate them to a non-leftist, non-socialist ideology like fascism.    I haven't overstated a single thing. Different factions of marxists violently oppose one another. That's an objective fact. So you saying hat fascists violently oppose other marxists, does not mean they weren't influenced by Marxism. If that were a disqualifier, there would be no true marxists, because once again, that whole constant violent infighting thing. And nothing about fascism prohibits it from also being socialist. I don't know why you keep asserting that. State controlled economy socialism and fascism go hand in hand, in fact. Fascism is not a non-socialist ideology.     To Anarchists, the State itself is an unjust form of authority and hierarchy, it is itself a source of oppression, and, as such, to Anarchists the worker's revolution must also be against the state alongside the capitalist class.     Nothing about anarchism innately cares about a worker's revolution or a capitalist class. That is purely your redefinition under a Marxist worldview. This is all nonsense.     As such, to Marxists the worker's revolution is not against the state, and, in fact, seizing control of it should be a major goal of the revolution, because the state can be a valuable tool in advancing the interests of the working class.    Yeah, that's probably where a significant portion of the murderous bent of the ideology comes from. This exact belief.     But despite that difference, both Anarchists and Marxists still seek the empowerment and liberation of the working class.    Anarchists seek no such thing. Anarcho-communists, maybe.      The inter-Marxist conflicts, primarily the issue of Trotsky vs. Stalin    There are many, many conflicts. Doesn't even come close to ending there.     Trotsky began calling for a political revolution in the Soviet Union, to remove Stalin and his clique and restore control to the working class.     More like he did what all power hungry communists do. Tried to seize more power for himself because he believed only he knew how to best implement the ""revolution."" Which is just what they call their unending lust for power and control. No surprise coming from a guy who wanted to spread his ""revolution"" across the world.     But both factions, despite their different views on how it should be achieved, were working towards the empowerment and liberation of the working class.    FUCKIN LOL. Imagine actually believing they were anything more than murderous thugs who desired power for themselves. All they did was oppress. They didn't liberate or empower. They deported all the farmers and starved their own people.     The differences and splits between tendencies within the socialist movement are nothing compared to the difference between ""liberate the working class"" and ""further subjugate the working class for the benefit of the rich and powerful"".    When the hell did those socialist movements do anything other than subjugate people for the benefit of the powerful? You're completely delusional.     Fascists are not on the side of the working class, they are on the side of the ruling class. Socialists are on the side of the working class, and are completely opposed to any ruling class.    Is that why those socialist movements had the most genocidal, murderous rulers? It's insane how ideologically narrow minded you are.     Fascism is a defense mechanism of the liberal order    Lol you just repeat this utter nonsense. Fascism, if it opposes one thing for certain, it's fucking liberalism.",0
711,"I think Nettled's viewpoint is that fascism and socialism both stem from a similar start point, of a Marxist viewpoint of the world.    The Marxist viewpoint seems to vaguely stem from the belief that the world is inherently divided into two factions, the capitalists, who operate through capital, and the workers, who operate through labor. The Marxists see this as inherently unfair, and as such which to change this situation.    Different branches of Marxism all see different paths, and see different results. For example, Democratic Socialists Who might just be liberals disguised as Marxists see something like incremental changes, with gradual increases redirecting more wealth from the capitalists to the workers through increased taxations on the rich to support growing social services as the path towards correcting this unfairness. That is, keep capitalism but fix it.    Stalinists see this as total hogwash, and instead call for a revolution to overthrow the capitalist state, and replace it with a centralized state which will implement a communist command and control economy, and guide the country towards a glorious theoretical future where it can peacefully disband as the economy runs itself.    Maoists see something vaguely similar, but put a greater even greater is probably a better way of phrasing it emphasis on the 'communist spirit', a fire for the cause which is necessary for the transition hence the Cultural Revolution and stuff like village 'factories' making steel.    AnarchoCommunists believe that no, a state itself I'm not gonna lie, an anarchist's conception of the state is the wiggiest part of any ideology I've ever seen is part of the problem, and we need to tear down the state, then from the ruined remains build up small anarchist communes, which will implement communist economies From each according to their ability, to each according to their need, with the mechanism for maintaining this being indoctrination in order to make such behavior automatic and assumptive, just like 'greed' is automatic and assumptive in a capitalist system, and probably some sort of social pressure?. As a side note, you can totally divorce this system from communism just leave out the socialist economy part, which Nettled points out.    Each of these systems except for maybe Maoism and Stalinism are fundamentally incompatible with each other. They might ally up to overthrow the current order actually, no they won't, Dem-Socs will fight with the liberals, but once they win, they'll turn on each other with fury you only save for a heretic.    Fascism sorta fits this mold. They actually agree with the central proposition, that the Capitalist economy is unfair, that the fruits of labor are going to those who don't deserve it. If you look at Fascist propaganda, you'll see this hatred for 'capitalists' in their disdain for the liberal Democracies, who fatten the factory owners and capitalists at the expense of the souls and spirit of the people. Hell, even Nazi Germany, which had incorporated racism as its driving purpose to a significantly greater extent than any other fascist regime, still this dichotomy as a major part of its ideology. The Jew is archetypically described as greedy, moneygrubbing parasites, motivated only by money, in order to fleece the good, hardworking German worker. The parallels are obvious. Their solution even sorta lines up with elements of these other ideologies. From Stalinism, they envision a centralized state which will will implement a great purification of the vice and greedy class of people, and raise up the people oppressed by these fatcats. From Maoism, there is a major focus on the spirit and dedication of the people to the ideological cause, in order to sustain the movement. From the AnarchoCommunism, there is a major focus on indoctrination, necessary to change the fundamental assumptions and worldview of the regime, which is necessary as part of this process to excise greed and egotism. And finally, from DemSocs, there's this incorporation of parts of capitalism though significantly curtailed, and closer to the command-control economy of the Stalinists than the capitalist economy which DemSocs tend to crop up in, but with their gains redirected from the greedy parasites, and towards the people, through massive public works and a greatly expanded state and military.    Do I agree with Nettled's conclusion?    I actually  don't . I think he's right that the fascism does have Marxist influences, since they were born in the same era, and cross contamination is inevitable. However, I think this is a case of convergent evolution. Both Nazis and Communists grew up in a similar environment, with similar problems presented. As such, their doctrine tended to both point to these similar problems, with their solutions thus necessarily finding significant overlap. Beyond this, both the Fascists and the Communists, where they actually got hold of states, found themselves facing similar problems. As such, where theory before was enough, the actual act of governing necessarily lead to a bunch of the underlying assumptions of each regime being found to be false, and resulting in Totalitarian, inefficient, and brutal states to compensate that is, since clearly the theory not shaking up is because of  enemy action  and us not being wrong, we just need to concentrate enough force to  crush the rightests/Jews/badguys and fix society .",2
712,they weren't. there was lots of anti bolshewik propaganda in both fascist germany and italy. also both got financed by capital interests,2
713,"Wait this is just horribly wrong, I have no idea why people are upvoting you. I'm not an expert on the USSR, but I  am  very familiar with Maoist China, and I'll tell you this right now,  famines kill millions regularly, and Mao engineered a famine . These numbers are not propaganda, this is fact. There's debate exactly how many millions are dead, but all numbers point to the   TENS OF MILLIONS        .        This is from a single event.  I'm not even started at the mass killings of landlords, or the purges of 'rightists' and 'counterrevolutionaries', or the Cultural Revolution, etc. etc. etc.    This it total and complete revisionism in the most horrific way, and should be treated in the same way that someone trying to downplay the deaths in the Holocaust should be.    This is indefensible ground, and I have no idea what made you even consider thinking this is a reasonable position to take.",0
714, they weren't.     That's objectively false.      there was lots of anti bolshewik propaganda in both fascist germany and italy.    Even your reasoning here makes zero sense. How does this mean they weren't influenced by Marxism? Bolshevism is not Marxism. Being against is is not evidence of them not being influenced by Marx.    And none of this changes my main point that Communism is a far more murderous ideology than Fascism.,0
715,"As a direct result of the globalization of capitalism, the world is by far the best that it has ever been in history. The lowest level of poverty, highest level of health, highest level of intelligence, highest level of population, lowest level of war, lowest level of crime, etc. There has never been a better time in the history of history to be a human being, and it isnt even close.     ""In 1820, the vast majority of people lived in extreme poverty and only a tiny elite enjoyed higher standards of living. Economic growth over the last 200 years completely transformed our world, with the share of the world population living in extreme poverty falling continuously over the last two centuries. This is even more remarkable when we consider that the population increased 7-fold over the same time. In a world without economic growth, an increase in the population would result in less and less income for everyone. A 7-fold increase in the world population would be potentially enough to drive everyone into extreme poverty. Yet, the exact opposite happened. In a time of unprecedented population growth, we managed to lift more and more people out of the extreme poverty of the past.""    ",1

We had just one species of all of the species of animals on earth turning to stone before the wipe, and after they are still the only animals other than humans to have had this happen to them. Something or someone must have initiated the stoneification, so it makes sense that they would have tested it first to figure out the rules of the power and check how it works. The show has already shown that it pays close attention to the scientific method when it comes to figuring things out, so it makes sense that it would have antagonists also use this and add foreshadowing to that fact early on, as the author has shown himself to be quite intelligent.",2
765,"Only Swallows and Humans were affected, so I think it’s safe to say that the swallows were a test run.",2
766,"maybe swallows were the real target, and they took out humans by accident after they finished the job.",2
767,Humanity was a price worth paying to destroy the swallow menace.,2
768,Test run? How sure are you? It might be natural disaster like some asteroid or volcano eruption causing ashes to affect swallow first before the human?

788,I like the clash of ideals going on here. That was one of a handful of points I really wanted the show to address sooner than later. In what direction do they plan to steer humanity going forward and how will that be achieved?    I initially expected Tsukasa to be just this antagonistic figure judging from the OP but when he woke up I quickly saw him as this calm guy having a deep connection to mother nature. Eventually he developed into a more complex & flawed character that I thoroughly enjoy for now.     He wants the youth and only the youth to survive as they are not the source of his agony in his previous life. They are more prone to adapt t.   Senku on the other side loves things that wouldn't have been possible without the countless efforts of adults so he is aware of the benefit they bring. I think he wants to return to the world prior to this event whereas Tsukasa wants to reshape it from the ground up. Two distinctly different approaches clashing right here and I love it.     I can't see them split up right away though since they kinda need each other for now. But I think once they are able to awaken people in a higher frequency and a decent population has accumulated then they'll walk different paths.,1

Plastic does break down over time due to it's nature so water bottles and the like might remain but not be strong enough to use anymore even if buried in a dump. Seawater and Sunlight breaks plastic into tiny parts. Unknown if the oil eating and other sea bottom bacteria eaters can eat plastics yet although the bi products of oil being consumed are toxic to more common lifeforms for awhile.   Dump aluminum cans and other aluminum products still be good though if not to much water or air has passed though. Aluminum does rust it just rusts slowly.,2

847,"This anime is secretly a mindcontroling weapon to make children interested in   SCIENCE!  not complaining, this shit is pretty educational    Senku already prepared himself to Tsukasa betrayl, but i doubt he can do anythinng agaisn't that guy, he's fuckingsuper human, theres no human alive who ever managed to win agaisnt a full grown lion in a fair fight like he did and with such ease, or catch boars bare handed wtf. But i see his point on reviving greedy people, but i have t agree with Senku, in order to recreate civilization, you need as many people as you can, and i'm pretty sure everyone wont have time to worry on collecting taxes and shit.     ;    Plus Taiju is dumb as a rock... at least he's nice hearted unlike Tsukasa.",0

849,"Well, I'm just wondering if they'll actually set up Tsukasa as an antagonist. His character design and his motivations seem to imply coming head to head with Senku and Taiju. But I wouldn't mind a red herring here.",1
850," But I wouldn't mind a red herring here.    Next episode just opening with Tsukasa going ""oh yeah what was I even thinking this is obviously immoral of me and I shouldn't be making such impetuous decisions about society at large based on one bad experience in my childhood"", and then they go make friendship bracelets.",1
851,I was more thinking of a mutual understanding of each other's viewpoints and then breaking off. Never really conflicting much with each other afterwards. But I suppose that could also be me overthinking it and wanting to see some strange resolution.,1
852,"We don’t call it “antagonist”, we call it “opposition”. Political correctness, remember!",1
853,"I dunno, seems pretty antagonist thing to when you start murdering people.",1
854,Isn't that just what antagonist means? The person opposing the protagonist,1
855,"Look at Death Note though. Light was the protagonist with anti-hero characteristic and the one opposing him was L, whose views were morally consistent with abiding law. Was he an antagonist then? For Light yes, absolutely, since it was someone he had to defeat to succeed, but for us viewers, L was just someone with opposite views, so an opposition is a moral conflict, which is now present in Dr.Stone but instead of the problematic of justice it put’s forward the problem of economic/social system. But same goes with generic stories about heroes and villains- both have some moral beliefs, but it is created in a way that makes you side with the hero.        And of course if somebody strongly sides with the protagonist, then the opposition will become an antagonist.",1
856,"The story followed light primarily, so he's the protagonist and L is the antagonist because he opposes the main character of the story. What you're describing is closer to asking if they are heroes or villains. You can have a morally reprehensible protagonist but you can't have a villain with the moral high ground",2
857,That is what I’m talking about. L was an antagonist to the protagonist but in the sphere of the moral conflict the story revolved around he was a moral opposition to the protagonist and his ideals,1
858,It's not just that he was the antagonist  to  the protagonist but he was the antagonist of the story as a whole because the story followed light. L is an antagonist regardless of his morality and Light is a protagonist regardless of his morality.,1
859,"I feel like you’re not getting what I’m saying at all. Yes, in terms of the story they are ultimately a protagonist and an antagonist.      In terms of the presented   moral conflict  L is somebody with opposite views to Light, therefore he is an opposition in that moral conflict. That’s my point.      The political and economical background of the  moral conflict  presented in Dr.Stone made me think of political correctness and in politics we call the other party “opposition” not “antagonist” hence my attempt to make a joke. I hope you can understand me better now.",1
860,"Sorry, it was a pretty badly executed joke that appeared to be more of an attempt at bringing in politics to a context where it is mostly absent. You probably could've just said 'It was an attempt at a joke' instead of writing these paragraphs about moral conflicts and such",1
861,"It was a joke, but everything I said later is a part of how I perceive, categorize and genuinely think of things so I wanted you to understand that too        Sorry for being a bother",1

876,"I mean, it's in the name really. It's not meant for anything larger than a commune.",2
877,"Communism is actually a very idealistic system, albeit impossible considering human nature. There will always be people who think they deserve more",2
878,"Funny enough, one of the reasons it works well with low population levels is precisely because the desire for more is tempered by, essentially, peer pressure.     For example, one of the standard drawbacks of communism is that there is little incentive to work hard when you don't gain any reward for that work... but when everyone knows everyone else, when the system is enforced by human nature rather than abstract concepts like law or ideology, there's significant prestige in being a pillar of the community.     Successful ""communist"" societies don't need to call themselves communist; it's just a bunch of honest folk helping out their own.",1
879,"Of course even in that instance, inevitably you wind up with someone who gets elevated to a leader position and then the whole thing kind of falters into a proto-monarchy instead.",2

886,"How do you mean? Where has it been tried that was not some form of peasant state? Why do you think the outcome would be the same everywhere, including non-peasant states?",2
887,"So we don't have many true examples of communism as Marx would have liked it, but we do have a few examples to point to, and they pretty much are always relatively small. The largest one by far was the Paris Commune, which only existed for about two months. This society was actually a heavy influence on Marx himself, who called it the ideal dictatorship of the proletariot. Whether it could have survived or not in this form is unknowable, however, since it was conquered and overthrown by the French Government.    I'm not completely sure what you mean by ""peasant state,"" but peasants are what I'm usually thinking of. For example, Japanese villages were historically communist with everyone collectively sharing in the fruits of labor, in equipment like boats and tools, and in major expenses like ""taxes"" to the local lord.    Edit: Not what you were thinking?",2
888,"I liked your comment because it was educative for me but I was complaining the fact that critics of communism always refer to the same arguments ""it will always fail, human nature"" and such and I don't find them very convincing.",2
889,"My argument isn't that it fails because of human nature, it's that it  succeeds  because of human nature, but the aspects of human nature that cause it to succeed are only really found in small, relatively tightly-knit groups.",2

892,"i would argue that once robots take over all the jobs the path to communism will be pretty simple. Anyhow, back to the situation they are in, you dont really need to do selective reviving, just dont revive a bunch of bourguies at once.

893,"  i would argue that once robots take over all the jobs the path to communism will be pretty simple    Ironically, when resources are scarcer, people tend to share  more.  As robots take over, it's much more likely that poverty and inequality will increase dramatically.",2
894,"for the first couple years or decades, very likely yes, but eventually i believe it will reach a breaking point.",2
895,"What would cause this breaking point, though?",2
896,"My hope is that such a ridiculous level of inequality as would occur in a society where everyone is poor and out of a job while very few people actually have wealth would cause the break up of such a society quite quickly. Of course, thats best case scenario. Worst case scenario, everyone is under watch and drones quickly kill anyone that even thinks of rebellion. Theres also the possibily some sort of UBI is created, but even assuming it not only gives enough money to survive, but to live, i think such a society isnt stable either, because the rich would detain all the power, and we would be at their whim. Even if they dont kill us for being useless and consuming their money, i think eventually people would realize everyone would be better off if the robots were not under the control of a privileged elite, and would start doing something about it. So in my view, the society of the future will either be communist, or some sort dystopian shithole, with all the stuff in the middle of these extremes not being stable. And from between those two, i think communist is the most likely, because its the only one where class conflict of some sort does not exist, so its more stable. Of course, theres a non zero chance thats just wishful thinking of my part, but i hope not.",1
897,"Hm, I personally don't see that happening. The problem is that everyone knows that people who have nothing to lose fight back, so it's very rare that a society where one class holds all the cards will leave the others with basically nothing. They give enough to dissuade people from risking what little they have, if nothing else. And people tend to only despise inequality if they perceive it growing, rather than just its existence sort of a ""keeping up with the Joneses"" effect where you're fine with what you have unless you're comparing yourself to your peers.     Of course, if I were right about this in 100% of all instances, there would never be revolts in the first place which is obviously not true.    This is a little off topic, but have you ever heard of a movie called  Snowpiercer ? It sort of reminds me of what you're describing, although it's a fairly campy movie.     Basically, humanity is destroyed by a winter storm and the only survivors were those on a massive luxury train. The problem is that the massive luxury train, despite being self-sufficient, can only produce so much, and so it fairly rapidly splits into a repressive class structure. You might find it interesting if for nothing else than because the movie is about the lower class uprising. Else it stars Chris Evans, who played Captain America, and he's almost unrecognizable.",2
898,"Correct but are we going to have 90 percent plus of humanity die off because no one is needed to do any work anymore. And of course the robots might at that point think the rich not needed either.   But this is why the Federation in Star Trek is communistic, there is no money and anything you want you get from a replicator no charge, who gets to live where unexplained. Once power gets cheap enough, resources in abundance, and replication 3d printing there is enough wealth to give everyone everything they want without anyone having to work for it. And no reason for people to work as robots are even better at being CEO than humans. I use a false economy in my Sci Fi where people work at jobs and a economy functions but only to keep people interested in doing things one does not have to participate.  Resources in the solar system can supply all our needs once we can get at them effectively. Plans to mine near earth asteroids underway now with some worry that things like rare earths will have there value reduced massively.    I don't recall any greater resource sharing in poor societies except ones down at the primitive tribe level where communism works. The poorest countries on earth have huge wealth and resources gaps despite having way fewer resources. In the past all automation created more jobs and wealth than existed before but it took Unions to make it fairer and often it was the younger people getting the benefit while older people left adrift. But i agreed with you as the final wave of automation will leave no work for humans to do.",1
899," Correct but are we going to have 90 percent plus of humanity die off because no one is needed to do any work anymore.    What makes you say that? Historically speaking, people didn't just stop having kids because they were poor or there was no work. And unlike, say, horses, there is no economic force that keeps the human population high because of its usefulness that will suddenly stop doing so when their usefulness is outclassed.",2
900,"Humans will stop breeding when starvation sets in tho. And if those robots are privately owned, anyone who does not own shares in the robot factories won't be able to compete against the robots in terms of labor, and thus lose their income. Hell, they even lose their ability to subsistence farm since land is privately owned nowadays.    As such, we either move towards a society where the robots are communally owned and everyone gets to live a life of plenty. Or we get stuck in a world where a small minority owns all the robots + land with everyone else starving to death/killed by the murderbots when they try to protest their fate.",1
901,"In our time, we have welfare programs. But whereas some people seem to think these programs will be the basis for things like ""universal income"" that allow people to live relatively comfortably, it's much more likely that these programs will remain essentially subsistence programs like they have always been.     Human nature keeps society as a whole from watching people literally starve to death. People won't starve en masse, but they won't prosper and they  definitely  won't be equals. It will likely be like the Roman Grain Dole again.",2
902,"Sure, welfare can delay the inevitable, but it isn't stable.    In a perfect world where all the rich people were some kind of hivemind, that's likely what would happen. But that's not how reality works. In reality, rich people are competing with each other. As such, there is an incentive for them to dodge their taxes or lobby for exceptions. And since the general public has near 0 effective power, there won't be much they can do to counter that.     So over time, rich people trying to one up one another will cause the system's income to slowly dwindle. Rich people that see the bigger picture and thus don't pursue these loopholes will get outcompeted by those that do. And eventually the redistribution will stop buying enough calories and starvation sets in. If rich people don't like the view of that, it'll likely be cheaper to just wall off some section of their estate as a concentration camp and letting the poor starve there. Or maybe provide some food on the condition of forced sterilization.    Note also that the Roman grain dole was funded by their military expansion. Can't do that in a world where everything is already owned and there are no new territories to conquer and tax. Not to mention that even then the Roman system collapsed in a spectacular fashion.",2
903," In reality, rich people are competing with each other. As such, there is an incentive for them to dodge their taxes or lobby for exceptions    The thing is, though, that these programs exist, and money is then raised to fund them. There is a subtle difference between this and the system you propose exists; where money is raised to fund programs, and then these programs are implemented. Unless a radical change in society occurs, people dodging their taxes won't cause programs to disappear.    If this rhetoric sounds familiar, I'm basically parotting the  de facto  flaws in starve the beast doctrine.     As a practical matter, these programs will not disappear or shrink unless society basically collapses. But society collapsing is bad for business, and it only happens when the rich and powerful are actually  unable  to keep the status quo going. The language may come couched in terms like ""necessity,"" or it may be in terms of altruism, but the funds will come so long as they  can  come. And if society  does  collapse, well, say good bye to armies of robot workers.      Note also that the Roman grain dole was funded by their military expansion.     I mean, the grain dole persisted for hundreds of years after Rome's military expansion ground to a halt. Most of Imperial Rome's income came from taxes and tariffs on trade, not from military conquest. It was a tremendous strain on the imperial treasury, to be sure, but it was one the state simply ate.",2

963,   SHISHIO IS SO COOL!    He can kill a lion with a single punch!    Run faster than wild boars!    Grab birds from mid air!    Catch multiple fish with a single stroke of a spear!    He can even split a boulder with his fists!    WHAT IS HE?  I think Senku is right.     Also I'm surprised! I thought the title Dr. Stone is referring to Senku but it actually refers to a bar of soap.  That's pretty awesome.,1
964,Not just bar of Soap actually.    Senku's last name Ishigami means Stone God literally.     The Stone God who made Soap basically is the title. XD,1
965,"   It doesn't help that he has the same name with another bad guy that's also named Shishio    Well, he also shares a name with the King of Braves so you can't really go by that alone.",1
966,"Soap, the anime.     Tarzan seems like some kind of radical, sounds like he's going to strike out on his own at some point, I don't see him agreeing with bringing back the elders.    I do agree with senku though, imagine having to relearn everything from scratch with a population of high schoolers, when you can revive college graduates who would already have that knowledge. Way too inefficient.",1
967,Well that guy's a mental...    Don't blame Senku for immediately building a crossbow.,1
968,Of course reviving Yuzuriha wouldn't be that easy. But I suppose bringing back this Kraven guy is a logical trade-off. Even though it is kind of agitating. Hope it doesn't come back to bite them and I am willing to bet dollars to donuts that it will.,1
969,Didn't even think about it but Kraven is a good comparison.,1
970,"Right, thank you. Like everyone else I first thought of Tarzan but then Kraven just popped in there and I thought it was way better.",1
971,"""Wait Senku! Yuzuriha's naked!""  Jabs Senku in the eyes.     I fully expected that.    ""Yuzuriha doesn't have a dick!"" Oh god this show is gonna have a bunch of quotable dialogue isn't it.    So that's where the name Dr Stone comes from. I figured it was referring to senku.",1
972,Great they're trying to rebuild society and they awaken Karl Marx.,1
973,"Seems more like Pol Pot tbh. Don't think Marx ever advocated actually killing anyone, just democratizing the means of production.",2
974,"Well he advocated in his later years that communism could only be established through violent revolution, if I remember correctly.",2
975,More like Kars Marx,2
976,Super powerful Karl Marx that can kill lions with a punch and shatter boulders...they fucked.,1
977,nah its pretty easy to make gunpowder if you know how and guy is not gonna live through a frag grenade going off at his feet.,2
978,"Something that no one has mentioned yet, Tsukasa’s last name Shishio literally means King of Lions, so it’s no wonder he showed that poor lion who’s king. Other than that, cool episode",2
979,interesting thing when senku changes his mind from 4 uses of calcium carbonate to 3. probably caught onto something weird about Tsukasa and wanted to avoid him having some crazy info,2
980,Calcium carbonate supposedly helps with PMS source. That's the real reason they needed it before they woke up any girls. /s,2

982,"I like this villain, the ideological foil to Senku. They both want humanity back, but both can't agree on certain things. For sure none of these three are gonna die because they're all equally important, especially Senku as he's the only one who knows how to bring people back. Although, I won't say that I personally disagree with Tsukasa weeding out the old who are more than likely not going to be useful as manpower and etc. There are some people better off dead. Might as well kill them  after  you figure out their assholes rather than  before  if ya know what I mean.    Most likely, they'll be trying to convince each other of their 'right' mindset throughout the course of the series until there are enough people around that conflict would naturally arise. All the while our best boy Taiju just does his best, good best boy.",1
983,"I still think the best compromise would be to purify the young first, and wait until society progresses to the point that it can care for the old. No need to kill them all if you can just leave them petrified until you achieve utopia.",1
984,yeah probs would be easier to convince them of anarchist ideals if they see it functioning from the point of their revival,1
985,"Frankly it's not even necessary to convince anyone through making an utopia, you only need to revive people at the appropriate rate. Just revive the troublemakers gradually so they don't have anyone backing up their problematic ideas until they've settled down with how the new society works.",0
986,"Older people have knowledge, maybe not academic knowledge, but they know things like how to raise a kid or they speak another language.    Btw I expected them to start domesticating boars, they are omnivore, but the new guy maybe against it.",2
987,"Indeed, good luck finding a highschooler doctor, Tsukasa.",2
988,I have feeling Tsukasa is gonna like find the recipe on how to make the special liquid and form his own group.,2
989,Lion King2019 looked better than I expected,2
990,Lion King 2019 looks like shit. This one was by far better.,2
991,Thatsthejoke.gif,2
992,I can’t allow the words better and lion king 2019 I commented when used in the same sentence,2

994,"No doubt it, it's a jojo refrence.",2
995, And lo to the surprise of nobody our villain is revealed.     I am surprised though that Crunchyroll is putting so much weight behind this. As while I like the manga its not a series that I feel has particularly wide appeal.,1
996,"While I love the series to death, yeah, it has been interesting how Shueisha also pushes it a lot in the magazine and while it doesn't sells bad it tends to be a bit of middle of the road, I think ""We Never Learn"" sells a lot more for example, but it seems to be an editorial favorite so they are probably taking into account something else besides just volume sales.",1
997,So we gonna just act like the author of this didn't write eye shield?,1
998,Holy shit I just realized that. The drawing looks very different from eyeshield anime I swear.,1
999,The artist is completely different. The Eyeshield artist is on One Punch Man now.,1
1000,That makes sense now. Thanks.,1
1001,This is sooooo good. And I have a feeling that it’s only going to get better. Really really excited!,1
1002,I can confirm that things get 10 billion times better after the first arc. The jump in quality of the series is just crazy.,1
1003,Honestly after reading the first arc again it's just as good as what comes after. At least in retrospect.,1
1004,"Oh man, the last human arc hit my kokoro",1
1005,this episode felt like 5 minutes dammit,1
1006," Tarzan already fuckin shit up...         moeshitarcher      Woke up a murderer huh?  Foreboding...  Lets hope not...      Save her so soon?  Why do i feel like this isnt gonna work?  Carry her back huh, lets hope thats not a bad idea either.      LION!  Oh shit!  Thats bad news.  More!  Run!      Dont die for nothin big guy!  You 2 need each other!      Yeah they gotta get the big scary guy.  Hope he doesnt end up a murderer...      Punched the lion to death...  Someones gonna have a nice new lion coat.      This guy is like a native american, doesnt want to waste anything.      That introduction hahaha ""Im the simple one if you need any thinking done ask Senko."" hahahahah      Man this guy is like Tarzan.  Look at him go.  Lets hope he is friendly.      Calcium carbonate?  What for?  Hmmm im not sure on this one.      Ag, Morter, Soap.  Oh i see, all handy things.      Tarzan your being sketchy as fuck...      Seems Senku is holding back the 4th one from Tarzan ide guess.      TARZAN CALM THE FUCK DOWN.      Seriously, this guy is no good.  I dont like his thinking or the way hes handleing this.  They need to drop him off a cliff or something soon...      You tell him Senko, dont put up with his shit!",1
1007,"I love how so many people are calling Tsukasa ""Tarzan"" even though it's clearly obvious he's George of The Jungle.",1
1008,Na George of the Jungle is better suited for Mr. Brawn.       chitogheh,1
1009,Mr. Brawn you say. . . ,2
1010,"if Tsukasa is Tarzan and brawny is George of the Jungle or vice versa, who does that make Senku? The professor from Flubber?",2
1011,He's the Doc from back to the future obviously.,2
1012,"Slaughter houses don't waste anything either so that Native American statement sort of misleading. The uses everything statement was referring to the killing of Buffalo for fun were the body was just left to rot. Actual animals took to slaughter in white areas though were just as used up as Native Americans did.  Similar misleading statement ""American Indians did not own property."" But they on a regular basis fought wars over territory sometimes with tons of atrocities yes you could call it Genocide under the UN definition which killing only one person for ethnic reasons is Genocide so the definition is near worthless so I don't call it that I reserve Genocide for original intent of person coining the word so Genocide is the attempt to kill all members of a ethnic group man, woman and child no significant exceptions and clearly the intent is if the people committing the act controlled the world they would kill all of that ethnic group.. The fact that tribes hated their neighbors over past atrocities was used again and again by whites in the take over.   So in effect the tribe as a whole owned stuff just not as a individual. Plus Native Tribes had not developed the technology of assigning ownership of property by law to individuals.   I can go in some depth the atrocities committed by whites I just object to a fake natives good white only bad ones narrative.",2
1013,is Senku planning to kill Gorrilla boy with the corssbow and maybe the forth way is something like poison. So I think we could see poisened arrows or maybe a sleep inducing drug to stop gorilla boy from going overboard?    Edit : Wikipedia says the too much Calcium Carbonate results in Permanent Kidney faliure and likely death. :|,2
1014,Possibly Best soundtrack for a new anime this year,1
1015,"is anyone thinking that fighting guy isn't gonna be a bad one?    NOT READING MANGA, JUST ASSUMING FROM HIS ATTITUDE AND HOW HE'S SHOWN IN OP",1
1016,"  What kind of high schooler are you?!     duckhue    Taiju just described every shounen cast ever       super OP character shows up and kills a bunch of animals, including a fucking lion, with his bare hands      laughter    Oh shit, he's perfect.  Too perfect ...        turns out he wants to cleanse the world of boomers      KUSOTTARE    I mean, he kinda sorta has a point, but he's still got serious issues lol. Goddammit, he could've been useful.     emptyinside    And judging from the OP, I had a feeling Yuzuriha wouldn't be brought back anytime soon. I wonder what reasons they're gonna come up with to rescue the others instead though because there's  a lot  of other characters in the OP and ED.",1
1017,The ED is hella fine,1
1018,"Maybe I’m just being nit picky or I bought into the hype too much, but this series, for me, hasn’t really been anything special so far. I know we have 22 more episodes to go and I definitely intend to watch more, but right now I’m thinking that I hope it gets good later on, because it isn’t right now.    The premise is interesting, but of all the shows to have a high school based main cast, why this one? It’s so distracting to see a guy punch through a rock or engineer a pretty treehouse and then they drop in conversation that they were in high school. I really wish they didn’t go with this trope in this story. This is just supposed to be the normal world but 3,700 years later right? Unless the explanation for why kids can Saitama a lion to death is revealed later in the story, maybe as part of what caused the stone phenomena, I’m not going to be able to accept it as easily.    Speaking of One Punch Man, some of the sounds in this show remind me of the bad sound design from season 2, especially the sound of the lion getting punched into the tree.     I also don’t like how reckless all the characters are being. For someone who waited 3,700 years to confess to his beloved, he sure was excited to destroy his opportunity to do so with all the throwing and jumping he did with her body.     A bit more nit picky than others, but I don’t like Taiju’s voice. All his yelling and hoarse gasping between sentences was unpleasant to listen to.    I seriously didn’t come into this series with anything against it. I wasn’t even very excited for it as I had never heard of it until like two months ago when I heard it was getting an anime and that tons of people love the manga.    I looked through the comments of the first episode to see if there was anyone who felt the same as me at the time, but everyone was making “10 billion percent” jokes and I didn’t really find any discussion, so Im putting how I feel about this show out there to see if other people feel the same.    Well there you go. I’ve dug my grave of opinions and am prepared to be buried in downvotes. As it stands, this series is a 6 or 7 out of 10, with lots of potential to improve as it goes.",0
1019,I just can’t understand why this super genius hasn’t appeared to consider the fact that they might not be the only people on earth? Why would you just assume the only two people to have revived themselves on earth would just happen to be in the same area and there’s no possibility it could happen elsewhere? I’m not really digging it in general tbh,0
1020,"The reason those two revived was because of that bat poop thing. That's probably something really rare, and even if it did happen to someone else, they would likely be revived in a completely different part of the world or revived in some completely different time period.",2
1021,"It's a Shonen Jump manga, high school aged characters seem like the norm and you shouldn't be expecting they don't bring it up to emphasize the ridiculousness/epicness of the situation IMO.     I contest that the ""sophisticated"" treehouse isn't that out here since it was built over the course of 18 months, but yeah, I'm also a bit annoyed by Tsukasa's inhuman capabilities. Given the science focus of the show it's a little jarring, but whatcha gonna do.    I also disagree 10 billion percent with your assessment of Taiju's actions. He couldn't be certain that the lions wouldn't break her statue something clearly on his mind since Senku just told him broken statues are basically corpses or if they would ever be able to return for her with the lions around that area. It was reckless, but not entirely unjustified.    For me this is a 9, tainted so far only by superhuman Tsukasa. A plausibly baddass-yet-still-plausible power level could have worked just fine into painting him as a threat. Maybe have him punch a single leopard and hunt the boars with a spear instead.",2
1022,"                  The premise is interesting, but of all the shows to have a high school based main cast, why this one?    Because it's based on a manga which is from Shonen Jump, a magazine focused on... teenagers. That's why you have characters in highschool. When talking about anime adaptations, you just need to look from where it came and you'll see why those characters would be made in that way. A Shonen manga in most of the times will have characters on that age.",0
1023,"Based on the intro, I thought that Tsukasa was going to be the antagonist. So far that's not the case, which makes me glad. Hope it stays that way.",1
1024,I mean based on the op all signs point to him being the antagonist...like clearly.,1
1025,Red means good and nothing else. Fact.,1
1026,"I want this guy to be good man, but he has evil aura and angular eyes, he a bad man.",1
1027,"I love how anime and animation in general can just make a person as evil as they want. Seriously, the angular eyes on Taukasa look really cool on him and while his hair doesn't look like an a leek, it still gives the sense of this guy looks terrifying up close.",1
1028,"Yeah hes a straight house, has a strength opposite the protag and features adjacent he looks good.",1
1029,"Red means he's 3 times faster, going by Gundam logic.",2
1030,"He murdered a dude and went on an ageist rant about wanting to purify the world in this very episode, and Senku told him to his face that it's not going to happen. I'm pretty sure he's about to do a bigger heel turn than André the Giant.",1
1031,"Honestly I agree with him. At that point in society it's best to leave the greedy capitalists out of the picture, of which old people are more likely to be. Plus, young ones still have a lot of energy, which is what is needed. I'd say work off of a communist system, revive young ones and reproduce. Capitalism will come naturally as more and more people are born. What is needed at that stage is cooperation and sharing of all resources.",1
1032,"I don't think you'd want to found your new society on ageism and genocide. What do you do when you revive someone and their parent survived as a statue? Knock its head off?        Also, while younger people have energy, older people are more likely to have knowledge and experience that could be helpful—sure, Senku is a super genius that knows everything, but it'll be helpful to have people to delegate to if they want to expand. And if they want to reproduce, having a bigger group to start out with ensures more genetic diversity and reduces inbreeding, so depending on how many people have survived and are within reach, they might not be able to afford to get to picky.       Lastly...if you manage to start over and create your idealized communist society, why would you ever let that be corrupted by capitalism again?",2
1033,"I don't think a communist society is the ideal one. The end goal is a capitalist society. But the idea of nobody owns anything is a really good one when it's not many people trying to survive. Capitalism should start developing around the time a good infrastructure is set up. A society. Civilization. Multiple houses, people who do designated tasks. The end goal was capitalism from the start. When capitalism, and infrastructure is achieved, and everything is going steady, then you revive the older ones. Give them jobs as teachers, have them do non physical things.     I do not agree with him fully. They should not be killed, rather, delayed in their revival until a steady society is formed.     At the time of writing my original comment, it hadn't really yet hit me that he planned on killing them all. I apologise for that. But I do still believe that the older ones shouldn't be revived so early.",2
1034,"Communism isn't the idea that nobody owns anything, it's that everyone owns the means of production. Personal property still exists in a communist society. But more importantly, his entire motivation for not bringing back the adults is that they're corrupted by capitalist greed and that younger people are the tabula rasa necessary to create an entirely new society. Going back to capitalism after that would really defeat the purpose.",2
1035,"Problem being youth movements been tried turns out ugly, the overall lack of maturity and tend to pick the perfect over the achievable often dooms the young, personally prefer a mix. I think your referring to the transition state of total Socialism when your talking about property. At least in the Communism all humans lived in at the hunter gatherer level everything was shared by all, in a sense you owned your clothes and maybe a few trinkets but they had no trading value. The problems with Communism arise when there is wealth being created and distributed who gets it needs to be decided and work is being diversified with people no longer having the ability to judge the work of others in the group everyday.",2
1036,"Well there's never been a youth movement that existed in isolation so real life examples aren't necessarily predictive of how it'd turn out when there's no adults, not that I was advocating for trying it in the first place.           As for communism: I'm not talking about socialism, no. Communism doesn't require everything to be shared by all, just raw resources and the means of turning those resources into something of value. A TV doesn't fall into that category. Now, as for whether communism is actually sustainable in an advanced scarcity society, I think that discussion would break the bounds of an episode discussion thread. I just wanted to clarify a common misconception about communism and personal property.",2
1037,There are obviously seeds of discontent. I just hope that they can work around them.,2
1038,"Overpowered sexy long haired dude that pretty much guarantees their safety? The tropes are right there, no way he's gonna stay on team science.",1
1039,"I don't know about you, but I wouldn't work with no damned murderer. lol    I imagine Senku is smart enough to feel the same...",1
1040,"I don't know about you, but when that person is 1/3 of all living humans and is able to pull their weight it may be worthwhile until the situation is more stable.",1
1041,We clearly haven't watched the same episode. Dude is raising all the red flags.,1
1042,The guy just tries to commit a genocide based on age. If thats not antagonist-y then idk what is,2
1043,Sure...,2
1044,"Tarzan is crazily OP and I'm a bit worried since he was portrayed as a bad guy in the OP. He has already developed different ideas from our protags. Being against him is pretty scary, considering he could probably easily kill both of them. Luckily they really need anybody they can find now but later on in the story he might become a problem. I like how this is developing! The 10 billion % was a bit annoying at first but after getting used to it it's totally fine. Yuzuriha rescue scene was kinda funny.",1
1045,AWAKEN MY MASTERS!,2

1049,I like how Tsukasa’s entire character motivation can be summarized as “Shut the fuck up boomer”,2

1055,Workers of the stone world unite! You have nothing to lose but your stone cladding!,2
1056,"Anime watcher only I though this show was pretty dope last week, with the whole “science the shit outta the apocalypse” vibe going on, and while I realize this show is only based in reality and not entirely realistic, I feel like this week got reaaally bologna-bullshit. Dude wakes up and  punches a lion to death in one shot?  Anime or not, that felt super left field to me.    So when’s the next episode? :",1
1057,"  Dude wakes up and punches a lion to death in one shot?     A very very slight spoiler, but Tsukasa used to be a professional boxer, the best one in the below 18 category actually. With a bit of animu exaggaration, it's not really surprising he knows how to 1hitKO a lion.",1
1058,"One thing that really bothers me about this show is the whole lack of psychological effect of being stuck in a rock for 2000 odd years.  Then all of the sudden wake up and is able to move again.    Like this last episode the dude wakes up and is like ""hey whats the situation, yah totally ill punch some lions....""    I think it would be great if they added at least some sort of side effect.  The whole 2000 years passing doesn't carry any weight when the symptoms can't be seen.",0
1059,"It's 3700 years, and already established that stoner are like uncicous",2
1060,Then how did Senku count the entire time to know the years.   I thought they said the were concious,2
1061,"In the first episode, direct flashback to him counting and and nearly losing consciousness.  He even made comment of how often he felt that coming on.  So I think it's assumed that, for most people, they don't manage to fight that off.",2
1062,It will be an inconsistency if they do so according to the explanation Senku made on the 'stone',0
1063,"So, this is Cringily-Overhyped Highschool-Level Chemistry: The Anime?",0
1064,"Feels like we're back at a rare case where the ED is better than the OP! The OP is pretty good, but that catchy groove from the ED has a great rhythm to it and imo outclasses it pretty easily. Gotta update my playlist!",1

1066,He really does remind me of Dio,2
1067,"Going to be honest, I don't really like the characters so far. Taiju's yelling is just too much for me. Senku seems kind of like a jerk, albeit not a total one. I don't like the way he constantly puts Taiju down.     Yuzuriha seemed like a plausibly decent character, but I have a feeling she's just going to stay as stone for a good long while.    Tsukasa is an anarchist revolutionary haha. He's okay, but  probably  an antagonist given the whole murder thing. . .     I'll give it another episode for sure because it looks good, but I'm leaning towards it just not being for me.",0
1068,"Oh, boy just what I was predicting about anime watchers...    Ironically, the characters are a huge asset of the series... But it will start shaping up after several episodes, can't say more because spoilers.",1

1070, Yuzuriha seemed like a plausibly decent character    From all of her 40 seconds of screen time?,1
1071,"I can't aptly explain why you  should  stick with this show without general spoilers of how the plot will progress, but I strongly suggest giving a few more episodes a chance. As the opening theme shows, more characters do come into the spotlight, and they receive a lot of attention. Taiju improves significantly, too.",1
1072,Fair enough! Taiju having some mercy on my ears would probably be enough for me to stick around haha.,1
1073,"  I'll give it another episode for sure because it looks good, but I'm leaning towards it just not being for me.    Hah, just posted the same thing in another comment.    I think this show could've been 10/10 if they had just changed a few things;    1 Made it more serious/realistic despite the premise, no more superhero shit    2 Less meme catchphrases; 10 billion percent wasn't funny to me the first time, and even less the 10th time.    3 Less forced situations They have spears, presumably made for an animal attack.. But when animal attacks, they revive some guy instead of using spears? How did Senku even survive for months by himself?    I don't like the way they force these things to showcase the characters as badass. You want to revive Tsukasa fine, but have him fight the lions with the spears.     You're still a badass if you kill a lion with a spear... but you're also not an overpowered superhero, which is a GOOD thing if you're going for a serious setting.    If they're going to the ""everyone is super OP"" setting instead, I think I'm gonna pass.",0
1074,"  1 Made it more serious/realistic despite the premise, no more superhero shit    I hadn't really noticed this, partly because I don't watch superhero stuff since I don't like it. But I think I see where you are coming from.      2 Less meme catchphrases; 10 billion percent wasn't funny to me the first time, and even less the 10th time.    I hadn't noticed it, just sounded like awkward dialogue lol      3 Less forced situations They have spears, presumably made for an animal attack.. But when animal attacks, they revive some guy instead of using spears? How did Senku even survive for months by himself?    Yeah, I'm with you on this one. A high schooler defeating a lion pack with his bare hands is ridiculous and kind of cringey. Just have him wield a spear and it starts making at least a tiny bit of sense. Also, I don't think lions hunt during the day if I remember correctly.",0

1076,it's like naruto but better,1
1077," Tarzan is revived, he runs faster than giant wild boars and can one shot lions lol this is a series that requires a larger than a normal suspension of disbelief, even for a shounen sci-fi - still will give the show time to answer a lot of glaring questions but I do feel most won't. But still, it is fun, goofy, and the ideas it is presenting are intriguing.",2
1078,BUCCARATI!!!,2
1079,"According to some quick Google searches, some studies say humans could run up to 40 MPH while boars run at 30. One-shotting a lion technically is possible as well as it doesn't take much to collapse a windpipe. As for the boulder, yeah...not likely.    But at the end of the day, this is a cartoon for entertainment. Part of the advantages of cartoons are that you are able to side-step reality pretty much as much as your mind can make up. So take it easy and enjoy this Japanese cartoon.",1
1080,"LMAO WUT? Are you serious dude? Did you even read the study? Its just a theory dude and it really puts an emphasis on ""could"". Are we all Usain Bolt now? Don't get me started on the Lion stuff lol Its hilarious to me everytime I see responses like this. ""It's just a cartoon and entertainment,"" - 'don't-take-it-seriously' and proceeds to give 'real-life studies' as 'evidence' to 'dismantle' an opinion they disagree with. Yikes!    I am not going to take your advice, which is basically telling me to turn my brain off and consume media. The advantage you speak of can all be undone if there is no longer suspension of disbelief - which takes you out of the immersive world of fiction. Did you completely ignore the last sentence of my post? I enjoyed it. So take it easy.",1
1081,I agree when he could instead been really strong for a human. Maybe stun the lion by punching in the face and then they all climb a tree keeping the lions down with poking with sticks. And then him being great at hunting with a spear not by being super human.   In legend Hercules does kill a lion with a choke hold. And a man recently killed a juvenile cougar with a choke hold while being not fatally cut up him self.,1
1082,Hercules is a legend about a demigod and killing a   Juvenile   cougar with a choke hold is slightly different then killing a fully grown lion with one punch,2
1083,dude... the ED is a literal banger!,1
1084,You simply cannot convince me that guy isn’t a Pillar Man or the descendant of one. He 10 billion percent HAS to be,1
1085,He literally looks like one,1
1086,title name drop Kreygasm,1
1087,Well we know who the primary antagonist is going to be.  I mean the dude is wearing lion fur and always has dramatic wind blowing around him.,1
1088,I'm really liking this new anime. It has a very unique story that makes it very interesting to watch.     I just hope that this anime has more than 12 episodes since that would be way too short.,1
1089,Don't worry it's already confirmed for 24.,1
1090,Oh that's good news then !     Thanks :,1
1091,"I was really hoping that this anime was going to stay relatively grounded aside from the premise of the show, ofc.  Cue outrunning lions. Tsukasa comes along and one punches a lion, outruns a pack of wild pigs using martial arts to kill them, and grabs ducks out of the air. since when did ""primitive highschoolers"" become a category, much less ranked by their strength?    Oh well, still getting pretty accurate primitive technology tidbits. The calcium carbonate usage was cool though the fourth usage isn't apparent to me... maybe poison?.     Interested to see where this thing goes.",1
1092,"I swear to god, if Tarzan does anything to Yuzuriha.",1
1093,The brilliance of this premise is that you can go so many different ways with it. The fact that it's an anime just means everyone is turned up to 11.,1
1094, I HAVE ABANDONED MY HUMANITY SENKU ,2
1095,Why the fuck is a highschooler as strong as a superhero,2
1096,Because he is Kars..,2
1097,Why the fuck is Kars some highschooler now,2
1098,"Alternative universe where he reverse ages, lands back on earth, turns everyone to stone and then develops amnesia.",2
1099,The rock part is ridiculous but the one punch lion kill isn't.    There was a guy IRL who killed BULLS with a single punch. ,2
1100,"Holy shit, this anime is so good. I already gave it a 10/10 on MAL, hopefully it keeps being this good.",1
1101,Why the fuck is no one talking about  the fact that Tsukasa's way of thinking highly resembles Death Note's ideology?,0
1102,People are more focused on debating if he's communist or anarcho-primitivist.,2
1103,Me last week: I have never heard of this before.    Me today: I have finished the manga even before the new chapter is released.    I never read like this before since Attack on Titan episode 3. This series has potential.,1
1104,"I like this anime but i just absolutely cant stand Ooki, he's the embodiment of annoying and cringy. Characters like him are why people make fun of anime as childish",0
1105,You are one trillion percent right. Not even one billion. One trillion.,2
1106,Who’s Ooki?,2
1107,"For a show that's all about cool science, that world has some wack concept of physics where humans can karate chop a stone boulder into dust.",0
1108,The characters themselves are the only things that break the rules of physics. You also can't count for 3700 years without going insane.,2
1109,Ah yes just your average Japanese high schooler. Can kill lions with one punch.,2
1110,"I really did not like this episode as the previous one.    Everything felt a bit rushed... they already introduce the villain and already told he's the villain with a different world view of our MCs.    And what bullshit was that they run faster than lions WHILE holding a human sized statue?    Plus, the other dude screaming all the time is getting annoying as fuck.    I would probably being downvoted to oblivion, but the first episode was way better",0
1111,"They funny thing is, they probably  should  have outrun those lions.     Lions can run up to 50mph in short bursts, but they eluded them by jumping down that cliff, forcing them to go around. Like most big cats, lions are built for power, not stamina. and would get tired  much  more quickly than humans.     On of my favorite evolutionary biology jokes is that humans evolved to be the slasher villains of the animal world, you can outrun them, but then they just keep coming, and you outrun them again, but they keep coming, and eventually you're completely exhausted and they just walk right up and slit your throat.",1
1112,"They explained the lion thing with the lions being curious/cautious because they had never seen humans before. I assume that the lions could have caught up at anytime, but were keeping their distance to observe first.",1
1113,"UGH @ people saying Tsukasa is a communist.    It's fascism that wants to purify society via a exterritorializing what you assess as ""impure"".Communism instead it sees ""impurity"" greed, egoism, posessiveness etc. as the very logic of capitalist production. These necessities which these attributes ARE under the current mode of production are then just adapted psychologically because hey - we live in a society and how we live our lives shapes how we think.",1
1114,Omg uR So sMaRt!!,2
1115,"Well at least he is not evil, he is just an anarchist.    Yeah who am i kidding he is 10 billion percent evil too.",0
1116,He's not evil at all. He understands the flaws of the world he grew up in and he realises this is the chance to create a better world.,2
1117,He literally killed a guy and was about to kill another one if Senku hadnt stopped him.,2
1118,"He cares about Senku and Taiju and he cares about nature. His behaviour isn't that of an evil man. He didn't kill the guy because he thought it would be fun or because he thought he'd gain something from it. He killed him because of his justified hatred towards old people. Besides, they shouldn't revive the geezer anyway, so there's no difference if he stays trapped in the stone for the rest of eternity or if he dies.",2
1119,"They literally revived him and a bird. Senku literally revived chunks of corpses too, that means that the stone people arent all dead.    He literally killed one kinda justified? I mean the sole reason he did it now and not before was because he would get in jail but since society has gone to shit he wont face consequences for his vengeance and was about to kill another one because he was friggin old.    Just because some dude beated the crap out of me when i was a toddler doesnt give me the right to kill all old people wtf.",2
1120,"Well, I agree with Tsukasa wholeheartedly and I don't see him as an evil person.",2
1121,"Man, I hope you never become an old person, or your philosophy on how to treat old people might actually cause some kind of dissonance.",1
1122,"Don't worry, I won't, I'll kill myself before I become a smelly old parasite on society that blocks its progress out of spite.",1
1123,"Isn't that just because you lack any confidence in yourself? ""I could never be of any use at that age."" There are plenty of older people doing valuable work. I've met old biologists and physicists, economics and computer scientists whose eyes shine with childish glee as they describe their field of expertise. You really don't think you could be one of them someday?    Back when Stephen Hawking was still alive, would you have seen him in his later years and thought to yourself, ""Yeah, this guy needs to be   culled  ""?",2
1124,you are not even one millimeter wrong.,1
1125,Yep anarchists the first modern terorist movement made up mostly of athiests. Not all anarchists of course just the ones willing to use violence to achieve their goals.,2
1126,How the frick can a guy that respects nature so much be evil,2
1127, laughs in snapping      chuckles in every pokemon villain ever created     Hell a ton of villains are pushed by the hope of getting Earth free from humanity.,2
1128,"Great episode! Love the look of Tsukasa and  that long-ass hair. I love that ending scene with him and maybe I'm wrong but was that the guy that beat up young Taukasa? I couldn't tell.    If I have any complaints, it's the sound effect that don't sound compressed. Like, I swear in that montage where Tsukasa was gathering food, I heard a sound effect from OPM S2. It wasn't as bad as OPM2 because it sounded a little more compressed, but it was still noticeable.    Honestly, after that girl was under the rock, I feel bad for the people that were petrified while getting hit by a truck or something or hell, while being stuck on a plane. Fun stuff.    Though I was 10 billion percent certain that Taukasa had an ulterior motive.",1
1129,  Tarzan   Tsukasa has arrived and it looks like things are about to get really spicy,1
1130,"The last thing Senku didn't tell to Tsukasa is obviously some kind of weapon. He was smelling something was wrong, and didn't wanna tell him you can make weapons as well with lime.",2
1131,So the name of this show is the soap made from crushed shells which is basically their only way to clean themselves and stop germs and infections. Coming from this show it makes so much sense now. A small yet needed item made from something you wouldn't think of.,2
1132,Soap can also be made from animals but the form he's going for is superior in many ways.,2
1133,"Calcium carbonate is widely used medicinally as an inexpensive dietary calcium supplement gastric antacid.  However, excess calcium from supplements can be fatal. That's it boys. The fourth use is poison. Maybe that's why he was reluctant to say it in front of Tsukasa.",2
1134,"The problem I have with Tsukasa's thinking is that unless he plans to only revive teens and kids, then how is he supposed to know which adults are tainted by evil? Does he seriously think 100% of every adult on the planet is a child-beater? Until they're revived, they're just stone statues; you can't tell a person's character based off just that.",0
1135,"I mean, that's precisely why Tsukasa's the bad guy here. He wants to damn countless people because of what they MIGHT do; he wouldn't be the antagonist if he was perfectly reasonable.",2
1136,"I've looked for it a bit online but can't find the answer to this general question: why do they need acid to revive people? It seems like there are only a few millimetres of stone, so can't they just like chisel people off? If not, then how come when you behead people you don't actually see their head in there? If they're just covered in millimetres of stone then also when people lost a hand or something their skin would show. If there's a reason for why they have to use the acid that is revealed later and a spoiler, please don't tell me that haha, thanks.",2
1137,"It is explained quite soon, I'd recommend not trying to look for it online as you'll likely run into a lot of spoiler.s",1
1138,"Okay, thank you for answering.",1
1139,"I have to say, as someone who saw when the manga first came out and ignored it thinking it would be yet another post-apocalyptic battle shonen I couldn't be happier I was dead wrong.    I love the tone of this show, and how it's one of those series that would never be serialized let alone be animated ten years ago. I'm liking it way more than I thought and I'm happy I have something new to watch this season.",1
1140,Anyone have any guesses as to what the fourth use is?,2
1141,"Weapons or explosives as a way to defeat Tsukasa if he proves to be dangerous to them latter, so he doesn't want him to know about it.    I'm just guessing though but that feels the only logical thing of him changing his mind and not telling them.",2
1142,Considering how crazy OP every human character appears to be... are we sure they are humans? Is this set in an alternate reality where the world is populated by the Pillarmen?,2
1143,You haven't watched Danganronpa huh? Highschoolers are OP.,1
1144,Damn that was seriously intense.,1
1145,"Going by the end of the ED, the gang are doing the Tarry Town sidequest.",2
1146,Senku could be written like Doc from Back to the Future.,1
1147,"hmm..i never read the manga but i knew about this character from some certain videos talking about the show....and i always thought its a bit too forced and convenient to release a guy who just happenes to be their BIGGEST obstacle to revive modern society .    but now after watching it....i can see how it happened more naturally, seeing how they were forced to bring him back due to the situation...and him having a bit of justified point of view to hate modern society  and live like a caveman for the rest of his life...",1
1148,Gez what kind of person kills a lion in one punch or grabs a bird out of midair. Senkuu had every right not to trust Tsukasa and lucky he did not tell him what the fourth use was.,2
1149,So Tarzan is Light Yagami.,2
1150,"What kind of title is « The Strongest Primate High-schooler » ? It’s so weird.     And Tsukasa is famous for it too. Like people notice him and go «This guy ? Stronger than a gorilla, I’ll tell you» ?",2
1151,Light spoiler: MMA,2
1152,the bad guy is an anarcho primitivist lol,1
1153,Pave the rich!,2
1154,"It's hard for me to disagree with either person. On the one hand only reviving younger people with less of a set in ""stone"" perception of reality can be good for forgetting a lot of old and backwards thinking that harms progress. Which also makes it extremely easy to create any kind of society the person with power or leadership wants. However, excusing the wisdom of more experienced older people can be a recipe for repeating the same mistakes of the past.    Tsukasa reminds me of the romantic ideal of communism or socialism where people can rally together and live in a utopia. Set out with pure intentions of making a better world but at the same time it's also ripe for corruption and can lead to something like Mao's china or the Soviet Union. His world views are born in hate and disdain for a group of people that mistreated him from a single encounter. Generalizing an entire group of people does not lead to good judgement.     Senku want's to revive everyone even if they're detrimental to an otherwise functioning group. He is either hiding his own idealistic beliefs underneath a colder more calculating exterior or simply wants to achieve as much by his own hands, science, and works regardless of outcome. By reviving everyone hes kind of taking a capitalistic stance of let everyone decide their own fate after they're revived. There is more to it than that, but that's the first thing that comes to mind. Also I'm drunk and just blabbering.    Interesting to see how this develops. Is it a communism capitalism analogy or maybe just a conjecture on what if humanity was given a clean slate to start again? I'm excited to see what happens either way.",1
1155,I think you're forgetting the aspect where tsukasa's idea means that they're gonna commit a genocide on basically over half the world's population.,2
1156,true. I got caught up in the ideologies.,1
1157,I hope this show doesn't do a recap at the start of every episode...,1
1158,that i'm aware of Japanese tv does that because they dont do reruns. it's buy the dvd or miss out if you missed the episodes.,2
1159,This anime isn't nearly living up to the hype. A human being punches a charging lion and sends it flying?  All this complex chemistry works but Newton's laws? Fuck them right.,0
1160,Science-FICTION,2
1161,A bit late but not sure how much I like OP Tarzan. Kind of still wanted it to stay somewhat realistic inside this universe you know,1
1162,The comedy part of these 2 episodes is silly and very cringeworthy in my honest opinion.    Though the setting and the world is interesting and I'm looking forward to what's coming next.,0
1163, The comedy part of these 2 episodes is silly and very cringeworthy in my honest opinion.    Elaborate,0
1164,"Hmm elaborate what? The humor in this anime so far just isn't my taste or type. Too much shouting and silly animation. I found these cringwowrthy more than funny, especially in a world that's pretty much fecked up.",0
1165,"Ugh, so, last episode I've seen tens of crumbled bodies but in this episode they run and jump off the cliffs with Yuzuriha's body and nothing happens? Taiji even tosses her like a bag of potatoes towards Senku and he grabs it like it weighs nothing at all? Yuzuriha herself should weigh at least 40kg not counting the stone layer. Senku should be knocked back like a fly...     While I like the premise, I absolutely dislike all of those 3 characters...      kurisudisappointed",0
1166,"My last two animes were Trigun and the second season of Mob Psycho...    This whole ""LET'S RULE THE WORLD BECAUSE WE'RE STRONGER"" anime villain shtick is getting old, I liked the premise as well but I'll pass on this one for now    What I hate the most about this trope is that the villain is always absurdly powerful for no good reason, has some sad backstory that makes him despise humanity, and despite his megalomaniacal tendencies and delusional ideologies they always seem to pull some nebulous evil organization out of their asses.    For fuck's sake, give me a good villain for a change",0
1167,"But you’re wrong about Tsukasa’s intentions... he doesn’t want to rule the world because he’s strong. He doesn’t despise humanity. He wants to take advantage of the petrification incident and only bring back people he feels could lead to the creation of a better world than the one that was left behind. He’s not evil at all, he just has a bit of a harsh ideology that sounds good on paper but wouldn’t actually play out well.",1
1168,I think the fact that the premise is people being turned into stone and coming back to life 3000 years later with no consequences should be a good sign that this show is not trying to be realistic or logical x,1
1169,"  logical    So, while Senkuu is talking like the most intelligent human on earth, the viewer should stay in the same role as his muscle headed friend? I can't support that even one millimeter. Talking about science but being unscientific the whole episode.",0
1170,"I think it's trying very hard to be realistic and it's succeeding pretty well. Yuzuriha surviving the tossing bothered me too but aside from that, there's not many holes you can poke through it. Of course, the premise isn't realistic but it's a fantasy show, not slice of life, you need to maintain some suspension of disbelief to be able to enjoy it.",1
1171, And ideally the reason is foreshadowed but explained later in a way that reveals the truth that's always been there.     There's still time for that to happen,1
1172,"Jojo Part 2""I'm pretty sure Kars didn't last as long as this bunch of high schoolers.""",2
1173,"Yeah, I feel the same...     The premise was great, but I feel the show might be a bit too childish for me.     I'm fine with silly/childish stuff in silly slice of life or comedy anime... But when I watch a show for the actual plot, I expect it to be a little more serious. Between Tossing the statue around like it's a feather pillow, one-punch'ing lions to death, jumping in the air to catch birds... I'll try to give it a few more episodes, to see whether it's going the ""plot"" way or the ""strong guy does unbelievably strong things, smart guy does unbelievably smart things"" way. if it's the latter, that's not gonna be a show for me.",1
1174,"Before the season started, I was looking forward to this series because of all the hype it got and the first episode was interesting, but now I feel like this is going to be the second show after Arifureta, I feel like dropping... I truly wasn't expecting this.",1
1175,"I cannot give out any major spoilers, but I'd REALLY suggest to stick around until  ep 8. If you decide to drop it after, it's fine.",1
1176,"Okay, I guess I can stick around for that long.",1
1177,"Well we don't know what caused the stone statues to break. And it was super scary when they jumped off the cliff just like that. I'll chart that up to plot armor.    Yuzuriha is super heavy, which was why Senku fell to the floor after catching her. Taiju is strong, so he's the only one who can carry her.",1
1178,"I'm satisfied with it. Yes, it's not Fireforce or Kimetsu class physical animation, but this is not an action anime, so hiring a top-class action guy is not the priority. More importantly, I think they got the character designs and visual quality very strong, which is important for a manga with such a distinctive art style. If they can't afford to produce ""the perfect anime"" with all the boxes ticked at once, then I'm in favor of them leaning more towards the ""high quality colored and voiced manga panels"" approach than the ""squash and stretch sasuga movement"" approach.",1
1179,"Right, I'm just saying, if they had to drop the ball on something, then I'm glad it was the action animation rather than the overall visual fidelity. It's rare to find anime that nails everything all at once.",1
1180,So no one is going to mention the fact that Senku was literally building a crossbow during the night?,2
1181,"the man just punched a lion in the face. and won.    I, for one, welcome our communist genocidal overlord.     takaradasalute",1
1182,"Tsukasa is suspicious as hell. Plus, he's framed looking like a bad guy in the OP. Trouble on the horizon?",0
1183,"He literally just murdered a dude, I think it’s safe to call him the antagonist.",0
1184,It still feels surreal seeing Boichi's art comes to life.,1
1185,"That was a lot of fun, ED’s great too. Just hope they don’t prolong Yuzuriha’s awakening",1
1186,"Kinda looked like he was making a crossbow or something in that scene at night. Calcium Carbonate can be used to purify iron ore, so maybe arrowheads?",2
1187,"Ah shit good point, he can literally teleport as seen in the goose hunting scene.",2
1188,The antagonist is trying to start a communist revolution.,2
1189,"So Soap the anime has now a Tarzan which apparently kills animals. Seems like the antagonist but let's see.    Also, anyone getting Minecraft vibes while watching this anime?",2
1190,"I think Tsukasa is perceptive enough to have worked it out if Senku tried to BS him about agreeing. It's not like Senku has shown great acting skills, he very much wears his heart on his sleeve so far.",2
1191,Tsukasa has some Baki the Grappler vibes,2
1192,Honestly poor youth getvtaken advantage by the old has been happening 10 billion years with 10 billion certainty,0
1193,Two minutes and half recap on episode TWO of an anime is a new record.,2
1194,Bruno's soul respawned 3700 years later!,2
1195,"Calling it now, they're totally going to revisit that name drop once we found out the 4th purpose for Calcium Carbonate. It's about to be a series arc I can just smell it",1
1196,Anyone else think that Ending Song is pretty fire?,1
1197,I love how Taijou's whole reason for doing this is cause he's horny,1
1198,Horny enough to survive for 3700 years. Considerate enough to not wake her up naked despite being Horny enough to survive for 3700 years.,1
1199,"So there's this shells powder which can be used for 4 things, but then Senku retracts and claims only three things can be done with it.    I suspect the fourth would be for weapons? We could see him making some kind of a cross bow at the end.    I wonder if it's for hunting, or maybe emergency weapons in case Tsukasa runs wild. He might be insanely strong, but an arrow from a crossbow will stop him",2

I'd also settle for foe turned friend, though, since I'm a sucker for these things.    This series is actually far more enjoyable than I expected. Senku and Taiju's dynamic is a blast, and I'm even a fan of Senku techno-babbling, something I'm not usually keen on.    As an aside, a question - I believe Doraemon was mentioned by name this episode, and Mario was in the last. It's too specific to be a homage/reference, but I don't think it's enough to fall under copyright-related stuff, but isn't this a no-no in general?

1216,"Man, I want Tsukasa to remain as a trio protagonist of this show, but he screamed a would be antagonist by being on screen alone :    I really worried that Yuzuriha wouldbe smashed when they rescued her.    Again, a really good episode.    Edit: again",1
1217,"I'm enjoying this show truly. I like Senku, his logic, and so far they've been doing logical things. Interesting how this will develop, with more people and technology. There will be other people who freed themselves, right? This guy was in opening giving away antagonist vibe and in the end of the episode he sure is one.    There are marks around eyes that everyone has, I wonder if that's just artistic or has real purpose. And I'm saddened that they're changing some stuff so people don't reproduce it. I'm not very hyped as I didn't read the original, but I see why people are hyping. Overall I'm interested in seeing an anime with a rare theme of science and making stuff from scratch.",1
1218," There will be other people who freed themselves,    Nobody in the show actually freed himself with his pov, only Nitric Acide with the right measure can free you     There are marks around eyes that everyone has, I wonder if that's just artistic or has real purpose.    That's the body parts where the stone first cracked",2
1219,"Oh, so you say that these conditions are extremely rare? Okay, I can agree with that, and the plot says that we need certain characters to become free. I just thought that these conditions may be somewhere else.      ... the stone first cracked    I know that, but I thought maybe it bears more purpose to it, maybe I'm just overthinking.",2

1223,TIL the anime is named after a bar of soap,2
1224,And there the fucker appeared... oh boy...,2
1225,What is up with the 2 minute long recap for just one episode?,0
1226,It's not nearly as bad as most Jump adaptations. ;,1
1227,I thought this episode was very well paced . The adaptation from the manga is done very well . Even though it is a Shounen . The story telling is the true strength of this show .. an amazing series,1
1228,"Shishio hasn't thought this through. Those rich people aren't so rich anymore. All their wealth was mostly fiat currency. It exists mostly in computers. Computers which more likely than not, don't exist. Same goes for anyone in debt. The debt no longer exists.     Even if that wealth did exist, it's still worthless. There is nothing to spend money on.     There's no way to prove anyone owns any piece of land. Or hell prove anyone owns everything. They don't even have the clothes they were wearing when they turned into stone.     Good luck even finding ant land you owned before.",2

Yeah, but he's right in that they would  try  to boss people around, and generally be a nuisance. They would be  accustomed  to owning everything and would behave as such. I don't agree with his solution, but I do agree with him that it would be an issue if they just went around waking everyone up as fast as possible.",2
1230,  THE ED WAS AMAZING      The song and the visuals are just awesome for both OP and ED. I wasn’t sure what kind of song they would go for with the ED but that was realllly good.,1
1231,WAIT THIS IS A THING HOL UP,2
1232,Are you trying to tell me that this guy isn't kars?,2
1233,Tsukasa is a pillar man.,2
1234,How many times can he say 10 billion and logically,2
1235,"Still really enjoying this series. Tsukasa seems like a real interesting fella, I'm looking forward to seeing how Senku handles him.",1

1237,Piller men,2
1238,The true origins of Kars. AYAYAYAYAYAY!,1
1239,Is this guy related to the pillar men?,2
1240,Just read the manga and you will know what happens,2
1241,"👉That’s exactly, right ! As expected of Anime4eternity 👉",2
1242,lol i just realised.I am Anime4eternity but i said to read the manga. facepalms ,0
1243,Lppl,2
1244,Legit thought he was gonna break Yuzuriha during that pursuit and have like a crisis over how his white knighting got her killed,1
1245,I love that we apparently have the resources to make such a dramatic outfit for Tsukasa.,1
1246,He skinned a lion. It was made of parts.,2
1247,"Yeah, and we used them for fashion. I'm not the most knowledgeable about this kind of thing so I could be wrong, but I feel like there were probably more useful things they could have used the lion for. But I'm not complaining, I really love how extra his outfit is.",1
1248,"I mean, what else are you suppose to do with animal skin other than make clothes?",1
1249,"  Duh, it's called fashion, look it up.",1
1250,"Really digging this show so far. This and Fire Force are the most interesting shows so far this season, can't wait to see where they go.",1
1251,LMAO they awakened fucking tarzan.     Well now were getting the spice added to the story! Interesting to see how they will approaching awakening the next few people. How will they know if there person is good or not? What makes them worthy of deciding that? Interested to see how they approach it all.     Dude is a straight badass thou,1
1252,"Time to wrap it up guys, Dr. Stone is simply a bar of bath soap that they will market to become the rulers of the Earth.     ;    I really have a bad feeling of Tsukasa though... My guess is when there are enough people that are revived, he will propose is ideals and some of them will agree, breaking the group into several factions. And from there, an eventual war will occur. We don't know, Senku might revive a person that is skilled as him but will agree on Tsukasa's views.",1
1253,"We gonna talk about that ED? Pretty nice. I’m also worried for the headphone girl. Seems like she’ll stay on stone form for a while, judging by the OP and ED.",1
1254,The strongest primate idea doesnt really make sense,1
1255,He's just renowned for being an abnormally strong young man. They will explain a bit more about that probably next episode.,1
1256,"First ep. was kinda meh for me tbh, but this one was completely the opposite. This show is gonna be amazing lol",1
1257,"I'm interested to see where the show goes now, since we now have a set up for conflict.",1
1258,"I'm loving Senku so far. His character design gives off a mischievous and wicked vibe, but I love that we have a character that just wholeheartedly wants to do great things, especially when they possess the power to do so.",1
1259,"I really like the premise of the show. Even though I am not thrilled about some of the characters, I am going to continue to watch just to see the worlds progression.",1
1260,"its showing first the extremes of human limits, so far in stamina, intelligence, and strength.  But, it's also showing that strength without temperance is very dangerous.  so its giving a sort of build up for the villain in our new guy.  And of course, when one has a weaknessnot being as strong as someone else it breeds mistrust, so the intelligence is building a weapon to kill the stronger man should it come to that.  I like how raw its humanity in its many forms this show is taking.",1
1261,Which characters aren’t you thrilled about so far?,1
1262,That felt a bit slow and quite fast at the same time.,1
1263,That strong guy is about to rewrite the communist manifesto isn't he?,1
1264,No way Tsukasa was not referencing Kars from Jojo.,2
1265,Bruno has now become a Pillar Man.,2
1266,"There's obviously a fourth way to use the Calcium Carbonate, but as he kept it a secret, it's either something to kill Tsukasa poison, explosive, etc, or something he doesn't want to risk putting in Tsukasa's hands.    But as Tsukasa's likely able to kill the 2 of them easily with his bare hands, it's probably not the latter. So it's a weapon of some sort. Then again I'm not sure one is needed, if they want to get rid of him surely they could kill him in his sleep with a spear. So maybe it IS something they don't want him to know about. Maybe there's some area of science they don't want to progress toward? But it would be futile, someone at some point would discover everything, like it happened in real history. So I'm not sure what this is about. If it's just something to get rid of Tsukasa, I have a feeling this might be some needlessly convoluted scheme when they could just kill him in his sleep. Even tough guys need to sleep.    Or maybe they think it's an urgent situation, given how they already have opposed ideas about who to revive...     Anyway, I'm not a big fan of him/his introduction in general; Why did they not use the spears, instead of having him fight them with his fists? If the idea is ""Senku&Taiju aren't fighters and need someone else"" that's fine, but... Still, have him fight with spears? You don't need a ridiculous human vs lion unarmed fight, to introduce someone as a badass;     He'd still be a badass if he won a fight vs a lion with a spear.     But beating him with his bare hand makes him a superhero with inhuman powers, not just 'a badass'.    Unless there's a real reason why this had to happen, I think they scene would've been much better had they just used the spears. It was over the top ridiculous.",1
1267,so how do you know if someone is good or bad ? they're all turned into stones,2
1268,I can't take Senku seriously anymore. All i hear is Subaru now @_@,2
1269,🗿,2
1270,i liked this episode.,1
1271,I love that they were able to introduce an antagonistic character while still having the overall episode feel pretty chill.,1
1272,"I really like the lessons they give out. Also, the music is awesome",1
1273,this ED is a......banger!,1
1274,Episode had me growing crazy towards the end!!!,0
1275,"There are no gym storage rooms around anymore, geez!    I don't know if that's meant more as a funny gag, or to specifically address the question of why they don't use ready materials. So everything from tools like knives and metal containers to materials like chalk and cement has been reduced to literal nothing in 3700 years.    It's kind of a hard claim to swallow, but I guess the survivor theme wouldn't work otherwise.",1
1276,"it could have survived but might be under roots, etc.  many metals would have decayed without humans maintaining or replacing them.",0
1277,I guess depending on the location it's likely that buildings are buried under a lot of dirt and shit. It's a oddly convenient though that the main characters were not buried.,0
1278,yep and conveniently in a cave!,1

1282,So the first one they revived is NOW a murderer😂😂😂,1
1283,"So last week I was a little harsh on the first episode not being very good in my opinion, and overall being a little nervous about the show.    I'd like to go back on that and say that episode 2 was great.",1
1284,"I'm so glad this show is turning out to be well done, I read the first 18-19 chapters and then stopped because I knew this series was going to be quality and was 100% going to get an anime.    I do want to emphasize how amazing the art in the manga is though, it's really amazing.    Here.    Plus it only gets better later on, but I can't share any more yet!",1
1285,"Getting really interesting, improved over ep1. Looking forward for ep 3",1
1286,"If there bodies are stone all the way through then how do they think or revive when only the outside of them has the ""miracle"" liquid poured on them?",2
1287,It's most likely a chain reaction resulting of rejection of 'stone' it not a regular stone btw molecules on their body then collapse,2
1288,"A good set of episodes but is anyone else really worried about the flanderization of characters, specifically Senku? I just hope he gets a personality that isn’t just DUDE SCIENCE LMAO",1
1289,"He does don’t worry. It’s just how he is right now because he’s been in full science progress mode, not having to deal with much else.",2
1290,"People wondering what the ""fourth use of calcium carbonate"" There's like 20+ uses    But I think the one he meant is ""used in making rubber"" since they show him building a crossbow and it has a rubber part.    Another use is in extracting iron from the mineral ore.",2
1291,"2. It took only 2 episodes for this show to reach, ""wait, end credits already? Naniiii"" level",1
1292,That new guy looks like necalli.,2
1293,I love how people learn shit while they watch this. I hope you learn a lot!,1
1294,"What a cool villain introduction, and already a great ideological foil with Senku. Didn't think I'd ever see the day where a shonen antagonist's goal was to remake the world without boomers. I hope this guy sticks around in the story for a while.",1
1295,The MC is going to keep saying ten billion the entire show isn't he?,0
1296,“im going to beat fantasy with science” or however the quote went. i feel like that what the author saying “this may look like a fantasy type anime but theyll be a proper explanation for everything using science”,2
1297,Pilot ep didn't sell me but this one got me all in    Also both ops and eds are dope af,1
1298,I really enyoing this show so far but I still some more time to get used to Senku. I find him a bit irritating.,0
1299,"Tsukasa's idea is pretty dumb actually. I agree that as long as resources are scarce you should wake up the people that have the best capability to pull their own weight and adapt to the situation. This would mean that starting with young people is a good idea, since they are generally more fit and adaptable. But limiting the selection to this simply because ""adults are dumb"" is idiotic. Numbers are the best guarantee for survival and wisdom is something that is applicable to any situation, and it is something that you build with age. Also while Senku is very knowledgeable, he doesn't know everything as far as I know. Gathering people with diverse knowledge and skills would be beneficial, and the older you are the more time you have had building your skills.",0
1300,"I still wonder why girl has headphones that look to be half as big as they need to.  Isn't it normal to hang them around your neck when not in use, instead of making them as small as possible and leave then on top of your head?",2

1302,I am curious to the fact that evolution or new species of animals haven’t seemed to appear despite almost four millennia passing. Or is there going to be some super creature in following episodes?,1
1303,"""Revive only the pure people,"" says the murderer...",2
1304,Where can I find the song when Senku was talking to Tsukasa in the beach   in the 21:00 Min I guess     THANK YOU :D,1
1305,Tsukasa did nothing wrong. Landlords and rent seekers have no place in this new stateless and classless society.,1
1306,The ending song is pretty good!,1
1307,I like Kars... well until the last part.,2
1308,So now we have Kars the primitivist anti-boomer in this series.,2
1309,"Every scene involving Super Tarzan hunting/fighting was hilariously dumb. I really enjoy the parts with Senku, though.",1
1310,Yeah no clue why they showed so much of that. He never says it in the Manga and it just made him seem ridiculous. Same with the boulder though i could be wrong there.,1
1311,"it's true, he did say there are only 3 uses! don't go back and double-check!      hey, I said don't go back and double-check.      gununu",1
1312,"Anybody else bothered by the final scene. I mean, it’s supposed to be suspenseful and intense, but it ended up feeling okay.",1
1313,Calcium carbonate is a salt and salts are stable over time so if they know where a gym used to be and they should cuz they lived in the area there'll still be plenty of chalk lying around if a bit buried. That is all.,2
1314, sees person under rock      able to kill a lion with a punch so prolly strong enough to pick up rock      breaks rock risking breaking the person     Wot,2
1315,Yea lol forgot how formatting worked,1

1317, sees person under rock     able to kill a lion with a punch so prolly strong enough to pick up rock     breaks rock risking breaking the person     Wot    That scene was definitely anime filler.,2
1318,I agree with Tsukaka 100 percent,1
1319,"For those who agree with Tsukasa's point of view, I'd ask you a simple question.    Do you think this Dr. Stone anime or most of the other great anime are made by a bunch of high schoolers?    Do you think the fact you can use internet, browsing website, typing in reddit right now, playing games, enjoying computer and technology is because a bunch of high schoolers made these for you?    Children and youngster got those foundation for granted from those who layed out the foundation for them =  older people who live a longer life than you.    Tsukasa's point of view is biased, childish and edgy.It's like those chunni kids who think everything is other people's fault, and the world is revolved around them.Bad people and good people can be of any age, any gender.Also eventually young people would grow up into older people too and become just like them. Are they going to kill themselves then?",0
1320,"No, old people already corrupted so he will make uncorupted youth, simple",2
1321,"Yeah, so you're watching the anime Dr. Stone made by corrupted old people.    Ok then.    You're only looking at the very selected few politician who're highlighted and then generalize every older people as corrupted, which is laughable.    Statistically speaking we can find even more selfish/ braindead youngster bullying people in the school, doing bad things, being insanely selfish and whiny.    Also looking at our ""new generation"" of 2000s, are they any better than old people?    I say they're even worse, and they're already corrupted due to the information explosion of modern technology.  Only babies are not corrupted now.",1
1322,Oh MAN have I longed for a communist anti-hero!    This is becoming real exciting!,1
1323,"Bruh I wish the author didn't make Senku  that  obsessed where it puts their survival and outlook at stake. Isn't he smarter than that?    Why you gotta step up to Tsukasa like that and make him the antagonist? There goes your protection and hunter    You can compromise on the current situation and just say ""yeah we can wake up the decent people first and leave the asshats for last- don't need to kill them tho""    It's not a save all or kill situation",1
1324,You can't reason with a fanatic or irrational person and the hunter guy is exactly that. His worldview is extremist and can't be easily changed.,2
1325,"I mean he didn't even try    ""We should kill off the boomers and rebuild society with the youth""    ""Lol no I'll revive every single one regardless or priority or usefulness""    That's more irrational than Tsukasa. AND they were the ones that revived Tsukasa over Yuzuriha in their time of need, so he does have an understanding of priority    Even if Senku wanted to it's not like he can even revive everyone at the same time. It will be gradual, and it does make more sense to revive people that will better adapt to the current world first, and leave the less useful for last    Senku could even just lie and say ""you're right, but it's better to let them suffer in stone since their mind is still awake"" or make up any other BS to appease Tsukasa from just killing people",2
1326,"Senku never said anything about regardless of priority or usefulness. He just said that he was going to revive everyone. I doubt he was actually thinking of reviving everyone at the same time, or to just revive random peopl with no thought behind it.",1
1327,"Man the premise is pretty cool, too bad the show is waaay to over the top shouneny. The ""muscle guy"" is annoying as fuck, the art style doesn't fit for me, and the foreshadowing is way to obvious. Could have been a good show, like i said the premise is pretty cool, building a society from the ground up...",1
1328,Drop it already lol,1
1329,Am I the only one that find the fact that a teenager killing a lion with hands is absolut shit writing ?  or is it something that will be explained later ?,0
1330, Am I the only one that find the fact that a teenager killing a lion with hands is absolut shit writing ? or is it something that will be explained later ?    Some characters in this universe are blatantly superhuman.    This series was never going to be 100% scientifically accurate.,1
1331,"It’s not shit writing if it’s a foundational part of the world that some people can do stuff like this. You may not like it, but it isn’t inherently shit writing",2
1332,Tsukasa is woke af. Senku is a moron for not agreeing with him and realising the full potential of the situation.,2
1333,"I'm looking forward to this show every week! There's so many ways this show could go since it's ""from the ground up"". It's exciting to watch every week. I really wish the girl was revived but reviving Tarzan was the best choice at the time.His survival skills are definitely handy.    I absolutely love Senku as the protagonist. He's strange and has a weird way of expressing emotions but he's a good guy. He does care for people but he masks it by ""logic"". Telling Taiju to choose the person to revive or telling him not to sacrifice himself, I truly believe he's trying to be nice but not overtly showing it. And of course, Senku does have morals even if he doesn't make it obvious. Tarzan Tsukasa did make some valid points about creating a new world but it's a cleansing pretty close to murder. Just as a doctor makes oaths to save those in need, Senku is the same in a sense. He'll revive everyone within his power. Tsukasa just wants a new world where he can pick who can live in it. Senku may be an awkward boy but he knew from the very moment they met eyes that Tsukasa is dangerous. That of course, led to hiding the creation of weaponry. I can see where the conflicts are beginning to arise.    Taiju is a good boy and even though Tsukasa overall is way more useful, this show is proving that just being strong like Tsukasa doesn't make you the best. Taiju is kind-hearted and loyal, someone Senku trusts completely. With Tsukasa around, he's undoubtedly capable but you'll always be looking over your shoulder. They defeated the lions that attacked them but now they've unleashed the most dangerous lion in their own home.",1
1334,seen alot of comments about Tsukasa and how he is somehow crazy? how come? can someone explain to me whats wrong with taking your chances of reviving the youth instead of everyone including the bad ones? is it because u can never tell the good people from the bad in their stone form?,2
1335,hes an ageist with murderous intent.,2
1336,There's nothing wrong with ageism,2
1337,"But Tsukasa is right, this is an opportunity to create a different, better world and old people would just want to bring it back to how it used to be. If he has to kill some people to make it happen, it's more than worth it.",1
1338,"Technically, we could already make a different, better world but old people running it refuse to do that because they like it this way and they are the ones profiting from it. I think that's enough proof that old people would want to bring this kind of world back.",2
1339,He's boomer hunter,2
1340,"  whats wrong with taking your chances of reviving the youth instead of everyone including the bad ones?    Huh, the opposite of ""youth"" is ""bad""?     So I guess he'll revive the school's bully who's also a drug dealer, but will let the science teacher die?    I don't entirely disagree about having a ""selective"" process for revivals, but    1 Age wouldn't be my criteria    2 As they don't magically have everyone's file, their best bet is to take a chance. You don't know how good/bad someone is by looking at his statue.",1
1341,OHH boy im a chemistry student and its so satisfying to watch im about to start reading the manga i cant wait to see what happens and how senku will use chemistry for the progression of the world of stone,1

1345,Does it really need one? As long as the shows airing are enjoyable and we'll animated it should be fine,1

1347,But... we have Maidens in Your Savage Season.     morethanonewaifu,1
1348,That's gonna be underwatched. Remember that 3-gatsu no Lionwhich had a similar tone and pacing was never as popular around here as any shounen manga adaptation.    Character-driven dramas barely get half as many watchers here as action anime.,1
1349,Implying Vinland Saga isn't it.,1
1350,First week of aot and kaguya wasnt that great for me though especially kaguya. Can we let the season go a little further? The episode at the end for those two were great. But seriously it's just episode 1 and 2 for the animes.     Nvm those 2 anime has the biggest fanbase here anyway.,1

1359,"I'm 10 billion percent sure Senku wouldn't have confronted Tarzan strong guy they got out of stone this episode and I think he made a plan in the time between Tarzan decapitating that one guy and confronting him because he wouldn't have done it otherwise. I'm sure it has something to do with the 4th use of limestone calcium carbonate, maybe make gunpowder. Gunpowder since I think Tarzan could tank all knife attacks that's not lethal but Even then he could probably take out the attacker before he dies cuz he freaking one shorted a lion with his bare hands, range is the only option like bow/crossbow, arrows, and guns. Finally, I think Senku is same level of intellect of Tony Stark with the narcissism dialed down to a 3.",1
1360,"It was obvious that Tarzan was the bad guy, so I'm glad that it was stated on the same episode. Kinda sad for Muscles-kun tho : I mean, since Tsukasa is the strongest man alive now, what's the point of the other guy then?

Of our two protagonists, one is completely incapable of expressing himself in any other way than screaming at the top of his lungs or yelling every thing he says and also has a literally objectified love interest tho hopefully she's broken out soon since the is no reason not too and it keeps finding excuses it's even dumber than I thought. And the other protagionist is completely insufferable, talks about logic more than a YouTube ""skeptic"" who hates women, has the worst catchphrase in anime and is constantly getting jerked off by the show and the characters about how great and smart he is.    The only character I can stand is the antagonist. And honestly he seems like a pretty chill dude who seems to be making the most sense out everyone. Honestly, with how much ""modern civilization"" is screwing up the world, I'd be in no great rush to bring it back either.     Imma give it one more episode to give it the proper three episodes and see if it gets any better, but after that, the only reason I'll keep watching is to root for the bad guy unless he ends up going full megalomanic, which there is totally room for.",0
1367,"Agree 100%, Senku is an amalgamation of every post ever on iamverysmart and I hate him, like just say you’re smoking the fish asshole",0
1368,Why Force yourself to watch something you don't like ?,2
1369,"I will give you this suggestion: Probably give it more than three.     I mean I don't know you, I don't know your tastes, I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy the show, and this is a jam-packed season so I can understand if you don't, but you might. I will just say that things shift gears rather significantly over what is likely to be the first 6-8 episodes possibly less, and that you  might  enjoy where it's headed more than you like where it is now although some things you probably wouldn't like.     But hey, it's your time, spend it how you like. the OP and ED give some hints as to the future direction, btw.",1
1370,This anime already bored me 😢,0
1371,Yea this ain't the action shonen you expected bro,0
1372,"I don't know how you could read the premise for this, or even watch the first episode, and think that this was going to be some big action show.",1
1373,Yeah but I'm not into action shounen bro,0
1374,"Ah man... this whole episode I was watching the intro saying ""oh no the cute girlfriend isn't here anywhere. Oh no... no just keep running... don't wake him wake the girlfriend... ah shit no just wake up the girlfriend and climb a tree or something.""    Fuck.     Well now I'm invested in this show I guess. At least until they actually wake the cute girlfriend which, if I'm guessing from the intro, won't be until the last episode of the season/series.",1
1375,Watching DanMachi after this and Fire Force just makes it look so bad lol,1
1376,someone rate my meme,1
1377,"He's not advocating for equality though. Just restarting the supposed meritocracy, particularly one where Zenku noticed currently it being about might makes right and the new dude one-punches lions.",1
1378,"Realistically, he makes a lot of sense. Not everyone has the skills to nor should have the privilege of resurrecting in an eden-like world. Climate change, destruction of biodiversity, invasive agriculture - all of these problems miraculously vanished while all knowledge remains, why would anyone want to bring them back?",1
1379,"What gives one the privilege of living? Or being born in the first place?     In this case it would be Zenku & Co, and even then, how would he know which one is deserving? There are plenty of ""worthy"" adults, and ""unworthy"" teenagers out there.",1
1380,Unfortunately I have to side with Tsukasa. He's right. They have the chance to clean the world.,1
1381,"Yes, some girl got hit by an old man so now everyone over 30 is evil :D Damn fine villain motive right here",1
1382,"Think about it logically: anyone above 50 will be a hog on resources more than a benefit, unless we're talking about an expert in some useful field. Older people are also more likely to be resistant to new societal norms. Sure, ""only those pure and young"" is a stupid way to choose who's being resurrected, but it's still better than ""literally everyone"".",1
1383,"I do think that it might be a good idea for them to  start  with young people, ones they have reason to trust to set things up in a way that they can keep in check, but I think it would be stupid and cruel to just destroy the adults entirely. Worst case scenario, just set them aside, build an entire generation of a new world, in which the teenagers age to middleage and their kids are teens, and they already outnumber the stone adults, and  then  start waking up adults a few at a time, getting them fully acclimated to the new world before they start picking up delusions about running things themselves.",2
