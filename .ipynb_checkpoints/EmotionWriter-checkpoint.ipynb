      "5      I think he will either be the circuit-breaker seeing as though he was able to wake up his friend physically, without the need to dream-dive, or possibly someone related to Teratsuki. It would be possible that Teratsuki is one of the company that Kentarou breaks in; which leads me to my theory that, not only are the people in Moon Temple dreaming, but they must also have interacted with Teratsuki at some point in time, seeing as though even before his death, Teratsuki already referred to himself as \"King of Distortion.\" It could be coincidental as well, but the rain may have played a role in separating those who goes and those who stays outside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

      "11        Character Charts    Not updated today because I don't think there was anyone important to add except maybe that dead girl from the train tracks, but I'll take another look at that in the morning.    ---    So that was... an episode    I really don't know what to make of it to be honest. Starting off with flashbacks inside memories inside dreams, but other then that it kinda just wafted around and didn't really show or do anything. So Sakiko feels bad for her friend and wants to atone through death, and Kentaro can hack and got saved from being busted by Nagi and that's it? Bit of a waste of an episode I felt, to the point when it ended I was confused because I felt we were only half way through because we'd seen so little    They are determined to screw us over with the character designs again. The mom did NOT look like her at all during that initial scene, neither did Kentaro until they flashed forward again. If that happens again next episode I'll add their alt looks into the chart as well just so we actually know who's who.    Edit: I did notice the illusion/memory people that the King of Distortion is creating to interact with our cast all have huge pupils so thats a nice easy way to see who he is currently 'possessing' as it were    And why the fuck was there a godzilla? ahahaha. OH this show I swear, just when I think I maybe have a handle on it, it throws that at us    ---    Edit: Something else. Is it just me or did it feel like they forgot to include the characters in this shot?\n",
      "12       did it feel like they forgot to include the characters     in this shot?    I noticed it too and thought it was weird, but just assumed there was...some kind of reason for it. Feels like Boogiepop's always gotta try and be a level deeper than other shows.    On the other hand I like the idea of everyone confronting their greatest regrets, or whatever it's supposed to be. Maybe it's just cause The Magicians did the same thing a few weeks ago, but somehow I enjoy the introspection that it invokes.      people that the King of Distortion is creating to interact with our cast all have huge pupils     Gundam IBOI saw it as the same as Mika's dead eye.\" But yeah, same difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

No Boogiepop and Suema today. I am curious what they're up to.    I still don't get what the King of Distortion is trying to achieve here.

      "19     So was I the only one who was actually frustrated when the ED started playing? Man, the story just started to heat up. I sure wouldn't mind having a cluster of episodes be released right now.      So, this episode is kind of cool despite not really giving us much new information. Kentarou has suddenly risen up as one of my favourite characters from the series. He kind of shed that bad boy look he had with his resourcefulness and kind-hearted feel. He knew Nagi as well! Interesting.      So, apparently Kentarou had met/seen Saotome before which is interesting. We thought he died but this either points to 2 possible options, he died and Kentarou met him before that OR he was actually in the tower which is kind of intriguing to think about. That Kaiju tho.      Sakiko on the other hand doesn't seem like she'll wake up anytime soon. She's kind of been consumed by the dream and I'm not sure what changing the pain into gold means but she's just been lured into a tunnel of light with her dead friend so it feels pretty morbid.      No Boogiepop this episode and with only 3 episodes left, I wonder if this is the last arc. I'm still super curious on the cliffhanger they gave us in episode 14. Still super intrigued and honestly besides Run With The Wind, the only show that grips me hard with its mysterious aura.                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
      "20     That kaiju was some pretty good plot element that they remembered to bring back. Very nice touch. I feel people's frustration but still as a seasonal anime, I can appreciate the wait for the future episodes.      Promised Neverland is alright for me.

      "23     The King of Distortion is talking about gold. I feel the word \"gold\" is the key.    For some reason i was thinking about \"stay golden\". About how you should stay who you are. But i think it will be more in a sense of ppl getting at a standstill, almost like a statue or puppet, unable to move and progress. Atleast that is the feeling i get.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

      "26     I don't know why but... i loved this episode. It went in a instant, and wish i could just skip time until the next one. all the conections between the characters, and the mistery of what the King of Distortion is doing. Is he really the guy that built the Moon temple?? Or the true King is using him?? But how could he use him, if that is not his power?? Are they the same person?? Or the King have way more power than we thought? Did he has all acess to everyone memories?? Could he have found a way to counter Boogiepop through Myashita, by using info collected in other's memories??    I fucking love this show. The way it tells the story, all that flashbacks, and the taste that the weekly eps have, while make you wanting more..... It puts a smile on my face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

      "257     but isn't he the one keeping them asleep?    No that's one of the traps Teratsuki added into the building. There's some machine that throws sleeping gas into the ventilation pipes. It has nothing to do with the king of distortion.

      "8    I think the kid just got next level validated by the guy. Imagine you're some loser nerd and then Bill Gates dies leaving behind this weird tower. It's this huge attraction and everyone goes inside.    Everyone falls asleep, and then your friend wakes you up but has no clue about anything. You then serve as the intellectual backbone of the investigation, such as finding hollow places in walls etc... Suddenly you get to the control room and Bill Gates lets you in on this huge conspiracy and declares you to be the chosen one simply due to the fact that you managed to find this room, even if you don't know it yet/nothing in your life proves it yet.     My man just got Isekai-ed IRL. Like there's no way you don't 100% believe Bill Gates at that moment right?

      "10   Just taking it logically...    Kentaro reached the top of the tower. Assuming Teratsuki knows what he's doing, that means that Kentaro is evolved past humanity. No obvious indication of what his power is.    We see at the end of the episode that the Shirou who was with Kentaro was probably the King of Distortion, but they were both in the real world and not the dream world it's mentioned repeatedly that only things the dreamer has seen before can appear in the dream world.    So... where did the King of Distortion come from, and how is he appearing in the real world with Kentaro? The only logical explanation is that the King of Distortion is created subconsciously by Kentaro's power.    I can't wait to see what happens in the last episode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "11   Shirou got to the top of the tower as well so he could be the evolved one. Maybe Kentaro is just a regular human and only got to the top because Shirou was with him the whole time.

      "23   Isn't this early or did it hit daylight savings somwehere?      Character Sheets - Updated    Gotta love when a character in this huge cast dies... to a character we haven't seen or heard of before. I admit to spending way too long trying to figure out if he was already on the sheet, if I missed him, or if he was just new    Um, okay, moving on. Episode thoughts!    This one lost me a bit. Lots of dense dialog with a pretty bland presentation, and I admit a lot of it was just how overall disinterested in the show I am at this point but yeah, not a whole lot to see. The sudden flash of seeing him decapitated before it actually happened was cool, much like Manitcore back in Ep1 except this guy actually died to decapitation, not an arrow hahaha.     Also I had a little laugh at Boogiepop saying \"I kill people\". One person, You managed to kill ONE person Boogiepop, hell even Echoes managed to kill one person and he did it by accident.

      "25    a lot of it was just how overall disinterested in the show I am at this point    Then I'm sure this will also not interest you, but have you considered doing some relationship-lines for the character chart? Just cause I super don't remember which girl Shirou was supposed to be meeting up with and they've referenced her a few times now   .<    As for the episode, I kinda saw it coming that \"turning their pain into gold\" was basically gonna be coming to terms with whatever their issues were and becoming a better person as a result, but that's just cause that's how self-reflection is supposed to work, both irl and as a trope.    I did enjoy Boogiepop's little explanation about it tho, \"If that's not gold, then nothing in this world glitters.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

And shes turned on them.      Cut off the air supply huh?  Hmmm...      King of Distortion found Boogie's BF       OoooOooo a secret door.      That girl got hooked on the good life and wants to go back... damn.      You have to live to have the right to be killed.  Wow.  Deep.      The King of Distortion has no body like Boogie and appears as things from your heart.      Man Boogie is great, such an awesome character.      Greaser Hair and Bow Boy made it to the top.      Its the original guy      He works for the Towa Group and is an artifical Human.  Hmm... but he had a son, arnt they supposed to be sterial?      He was trying to find people to fight the Towa group.  Wow thats a twist.  Hes basicly trying to find heroes.      So i guess Greaser Hair has the potential to be a hero.

      "74   Ha, looks like my initial guess that Teratsuki and King of Distortion are separate was spot on. People are overblowing out of proportion how convoluted this series is. The basic premise of every arc so far was the same - I knew Teratsuki != King of Distortion simply because there were always at least two iindependent antagonists.
