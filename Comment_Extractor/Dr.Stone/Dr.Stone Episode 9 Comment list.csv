30,"I am familiar with the other scientists/inventors mentioned in the show so far, except for the Wasilewski guy Senku mentioned in this episode.

Since I was curious and Google is a friend, here's an excerpt of what he did:

> Wasilewski created lodestones using lightning in much the same way as Ben Franklin did, but with tools that are much more expensive. To make a lodestone, first he had to go where there is lots of lightning. Summertime months in places like Florida and New Mexico are hotspots for strikes.  Then, he needed a better “kite.” Wasilewski replaced Franklin’s contraption with a small bottle rocket that he launched into storm clouds. Attached to this rocket was a three-mile long metal wire fastened to a plastic box. Inside the box was a bed of sand, and the soon-to-be-zapped rock sat on top.

> The experiment happens in a flash and everything melts or burns, since the lightning heats everything to over 2,900°F.

> And the rock in the box? It’s a magnet now.

31,Wow! Thanks for the info fellow Kingdom of Science citizen
32,"Huh that's interesting, I tried googling but there weren't many results about him (and nothing on wikipedia as well)."
33,"Sometimes (actually most of the time) you have to include other words used in the same context as the one you're searching for so that Google or other search engines could help you better.

Keywords I used were: wasilewski magnet lightning nasa"
34,"Oh, that's true. I searched only his name and I got some Saxophone player or something?"
35,"Seems like he used some expensive materials, could Senku really pull it off with what he has?"
36,He used those materials so he would have a  nice chance to get a lightning strike to hit it. Senku had to have luck for his stick to get hit but it still works with the materials hes using.
37,And the bold rock already had magnets on it so it's a great spot for catching lightning.
38,"It had magnets which is likely a sign lightning hits it before if not frequently.  
The part about it being a bald mountain is also important, as it means there were no trees for the lightning to strike instead in that area. (making it more likely to hit the metal they wanted...)   

At the end of the day it was still dumb (plot) luck, but as senku mentioned, his original plan would have been to basically fill that mountain top with iron staves so the lightning would eventually at least hit one of them"
39,I feel like it would be easier to just build a kite with some string and clothe
40,Then they would have needed the expensive materials as the scientist.
41,A lot of the show is dumb plot luck tbf.
42,And the show acknowledges that.
43,So was the very discovery of a lot of science back in the day.
44,Just realised though... I only remember seeing one bar being made and struck by lightning... so where did they get the second bar to repel it? Offscreen?
45,"Super realistically, Chrome was incredibly lucky to come across the amount of materials that he he has. Like, gathering that amount of raw copper just because it ""looks pretty"" would normally take a long-ass time. Likewise with most of the stuff he's got in that hut, but whatever, it'd be a less interesting story if actually took them years to gather everything in sufficient quantities."
46,"Also he apparently became an artist, making polarised light photographs with ice:

And he might have a mountain in Antarctica named after him (if it's the same guy):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wasilewski

And now he's officially an anime character too. Too bad he's probably dead so we can't let him know :(."
47,"He's still alive and still doing science.  Just not credited on any technical papers since 2010.

isn't lightning just like... so fucking cool? (hurr durr no it's actually really hot!) 

but seriously, how crazy is that... a random bolt of electricity comes down from THE SKY and heats a random thing to nearly 3k degrees?"
52,"On local Skyway Bridge Lighting often frys a sensor or camera or something. (sure it does everywhere) Politition asks should it not be be easy to protect the electric Items or even better generate electricity. Power Company Engineer, some how they messed up and sent a real one, just says No and sits down. Of course that did not fly so he then gave them the full hours long on how powerful lightning is and nothing Man has currently can take anywhere near that power level. (hope I recall this right been a few decades, oh Tampa Bay Florida)

Yes efforts are always underway to figure out how to store lightning power but I have not heard anything close yet."
53,Amazing! Thanks!

71,and everybody within a half dozen yards of that lightning strike certainly suffered great hearing damage
72,"They're basically dead anyway, because the lightning strike would've created a potential gradient away from where it discharged that would likely have been sufficient to force a current up through one leg and down the other, electrocuting them."
73,"People have survived direct lightning strikes, I think this just falls under dramatic license rather than completely impossible."
74,"No one I know of has survived being hit by the main bolt but someone getting hit by that is rare and when it does hit person is reduced to burned beyond recognition corpse. 
But yes people have survived being real close to one and being hit by secondary bolts. 
I do think this one Dramatic license."
75,"I thought touching the iron was bad, but you're saying the ground itself would of carried a fatal current?"
76,"[This explains it pretty well](https://www.quora.com/How-is-it-that-one-lightning-strike-is-killing-so-many-cows-or-reindeer-but-you-never-hear-about-this-happening-with-people)  

But to be honest I was looking for something I heard before (I guess it's likely a myth)   
About a bunch of cows dying from a lightning impact and others surviving, based on how they were standing.  

For example if the lightning would hit directly in front of them, the charge in the ground at their front legs would have a bigger difference with the charge at their back legs, then if it hits to their side, because the distance and charge would be smaller between their left/right legs.   

Even if it's fake, it at least managed to imprint me with how lightning kills in an AOE"
77,"Yeah, there will be a gradient in potential radiating out from the point where the lightning struck.  When you're near a lightning strike, if your feet are on points with different potentials, the difference can easily be enough to kill you.  There's a chance that you'd be standing exactly on a level curve of potential, which would mean you're safe, but since the ground there was inhomogeneous, those level curves would be very difficult to predict, and the potential gradient would likely be steep enough that even if your nearest contact points make an angle of only a few arcminutes with the level curve, there is likely to be enough current to kill outright or fatally burn you.

I did some calculations based on reciprocal-square drop off with my physics tutor in uni, and it was pretty scary."
78,"People vastly underestimate just how fuck off strong lightning is.

If it was realistic, every character with lightning powers should go around one shoting everything in their way."
79,"While that's true, when discussing humans specifically there's less of a chance of that happening due to how we're built. We're bipedal, with our two points of contact with the ground (our feet) typically being very close to each other. Consider then that these are mostly children or adolescents, so they're even smaller meaning their feet are likely even closer together than an average human. This is why you hear about this kind of thing happening more to cows and other larger creatures because there is more distance between their legs so the potential gradient is larger."
80,"Not to mention electricity follows the path of least resistance.  So unless you are lying down, or standing like a cow with both hands and feet on the ground then it shouldn't be able to kill you from the electricity.  Whether you become infertile, get fatal burns, or go into shock from the pain is a totally different thing.  This makes me wonder.  If you stood on a slab of iron would you theoretically be safe from a lightning strike.  Since human skin has a higher resistance than the iron.  I know Edison fried an elephant with electricity, but he attached wires to each of the elephants legs (and gave the elephant cyanide.)"
81,who knew that this was *actually* a show about superpowers and not science?
82,The teenage villain who punches boulders to pieces with one blow wasn't enough of a hint?
83,...good point.
84,"> would likely have been sufficient to force a current up through one leg and down the other, electrocuting them.

I don't know much about electricity, but since the heart is nowhere near the legs, it should be 100% fine, no? Considering the fact electricity goes for the ground."
85,"Yea, they like science when it fits their needs lol At other times it's comletely nonsense. That hut roof must be made of extremely sturdy thatch too to hold up two people without budging."
86,yeah extremely touch thatch there is probably totally not wooden beams below it to hold the thatch up where they can stand on totally not.

100,Seriously. I was surprised how emotional that whole ending was with Senku explaining how humanity conquered darkness. Never really thought much of it until now.
101,"I know we don't think about it often enough but humanity has done miraculous things, conquering the night, defying gravity, editing the very building blocks of life. The great thing is that since technological growth is exponential we should see far more astounding advances within our life time! I love how this show spark's excitement for the future by showing our past discoveries."
102,It's hard to tell if technology is exponential or logarithmic at this point in history.
103,I don't know about that. Theoretically there has to be a point where we've learned everything and as we approach that point you would expect things to naturally slow down. Luckily we *know* there's a ton we don't know and there's also a lot of things we don't know we don't know so we don't have to worry about it becoming an issue for a *long* time. Plus once we know all the things we will likely have solved most of the solvable problems so there wont be the urgent need for new solutions in the first place.
104,There was a time most scientists thought we discovered it all and all that's left was finer measurements and a few years later Quantum Physics were discovered.
105,Yep and every so often after that some declaration like that is made and completely wrong.
106,Complacency is a fundamental enemy of Science
107,i don't think it would be logarithmic. technology as a whole is  slower then for example IT-tech which doubles in speed and growth every 2 years(except for moore's law) .
108,"Moore's law is dead. I wouldn't be surprised if exponential advancement is next. Eventually you grab all the low hanging fruit, and then it just gets harder from there as you go up the tree. I'm not saying that's going to happen soon, but I do think it'll happen."
109,"People have been saying that forever. The thing is science is synergistic between disciplines. Better chemistry leads to better material science leads to better computers which leads back to better science in all those fields in addition to all the benefits of each discipline on it's own for example. We're about ready for an explosion in bio-tech with our rapidly increasing understanding of genetic engineering, stem cells, and nano-scale and DNA based machinery as just one example of where tech is about to pick up speed. We also already know several possible paths to getting additional massive gains in computation. We just haven't quite figured out how to achieve it yet, so this could be more a hiccup in Moore's law (as applied to computation generally) than anything else. Moore's law also specifically was about semi-conductors, if we move to a different model entirely (which was bound to happen) of course it has to die at some point.

The only time what you're talking about would reasonably happen is as we get to close to running out of new things to discover and we *know* that's a long way off, even with the rate of technological progress."
110,"Exactly. Moore's law was never about all technology, only about how many transistors could fit in a square inch of space. It's like if steam train advancements started slowing down and every one said ""That's it! We have reached the pinical of transportation and delivery technology!"" Not even thinking about bullet trains , planes, freighters, and fkn Amazon delivery drones. No! It's worse than that, it's literally saying this one technology has slowed down for a second, I guess all science is done now. Smh"
111,They literally just made a processor with carbon nanotubes which could straight up prove your point. Like we reach the peak with silicon? Stop using silicon.
112,"> People have been saying that forever.

Yeah, but at some time it ought to be true. Mind you, it doesn't *have* to be now, but you can get to a plateau - a point where the previous discoveries aren't enough to jump the step to the next useful ones. For example nuclear physics is in such a place right now, which is why the LHC didn't turn up a single fucking thing that's really revolutionary. We *know* there's a certain energy scale at which something freaky is bound to happen, and general relativity mixes with quantum mechanics. If something like warp travel exists, that's where we'll find it. Unfortunately, to be sure to reach that energy scale we'd need to build a particle accelerator as big as the Solar System. And that's not really feasible any time soon. So unless there's something completely unexpected at a scale *lower* than that... for the foreseeable future, we're screwed.

In the end, we have no guarantee that Nature is so neatly arranged that we can progress through its secrets like we're exploring a tech tree. Real life is a shitty game with terrible difficulty scaling."
113,"The LHC discovering the Higgs Boson *is* a big deal. Beyond that what didn't happen is as important as what did. While discoveries grab all the headlines it's confirming or disproving things that really lets us *know* something. There's also a lot more going on in nuclear physics than just the LHC. What about the advances being slowly but steadily made in fusion power? Positive net energy gains, highest temperatures, more stable designs, ect? And that's all with it being criminally underfunded, seriously look at how much funding it gets and you'll realize why we don't have fusion power yet. I'm sure there are more but I'm neither a nuclear nor particle physicist and I'm sure neither are you but things are **definitely** advancing in that space.

Fusion power could also get us exactly the type of power we need for the types of things you're talking about to become even theoretically feasible. But yeah if your standard is ""the LHC didn't develop warp drives so we're not advancing"" then maybe it does look like nothing is happening, but most people didn't expect that to be the result of those tests nor was it the purpose.

The fact that nature isn't a tech tree is a *good thing*. It means there are usually multiple paths to achieving the same thing which in turn means the type of getting 'screwed' you're talking about is unlikely and there's certainly no proof we're anywhere near there yet. 

Unless of course climate change wipes us out but that doesn't really have anything to do with scientific advancement having no where to go."
114,"I'm actually a quantum physicist, and I know the basics of quantum field theory - enough to appreciate what people hoped to get from LHC and what they didn't get in the end.

No, in pure foundations of physics, we're right swamped. Been for a while now. And now some people in the community are actually starting to being louder about it and pointing out that the emperor is naked, and a lot of the new physics (like string theory) has become empty navel-gazing because *we have no new data to go on*. The Higgs Boson turned out just as predicted. There are no hints to any new physics, just confirmations of things already deduced decades ago. And it's a dead end. Yeah, we know the Standard Model very well, but it's like finding out the Mendeleev periodic table but never finding out about protons and electronic shells so you can't figure out *why* it has that shape - it's just a zoo of particles that have certain regular properties for no apparent reason. Either there is no underlying reason (aka: we're at the end of the line), or there is and it lies in quantum gravity, in which case, we need that solar system wide accelerator.

Fusion power is an amazing application, granted - though last time I've heard someone from the current main research centre on the field (which is, like, 20 km from where I work - at least until they finish building ITER in France), they didn't sound all too enthusiastic about their chances. It's damn expensive, we keep finding new problems with it, and the running joke is that ""fusion has been 50 years in the future for 50 years now"". However, it's mainly a feat of engineering at this point. The principle is well known, there's nothing new to it compared to an H-bomb. The difficult part is keeping it reined in. Don't get me wrong, getting fusion working would be *amazing*, goodbye climate change, we could start just reconverting CO2 to pure carbon with excess energy for shit and giggles. But it's not fundamental science, it's an application of known science; a long overdue one, at that.

The one thing that it could allows us to build, agreed, is fusion engines for spaceships. Now that's an interesting prospect. However even from that to the aforementioned solar system spanning accelerator it's a lot of road - a *lot*. Stagnation would still be a significant risk, at least as long as it concerns physics. I'm doing my part (personally I think it'd be interesting to focus more on the measurement problem and the quantum mechanics that we have access to but still don't entirely understand, which is one of my research interests), but I can't say I'm extremely optimistic about it all."
115,"We'd have to build a particle accelerator as big as the solar system yeah. Unless we find a method to condense it smaller. but to reach further points in that we need to explore other regions of science aswell. If one part of science slows down, that usually means other parts are now getting more work  until something gets discovered. We don't know many platue's we could actually hit with science. Like one for example in science fiction would be transportation. If we are able to make cheap and quick warp travel/teleportation systems then we have hit a platue in science since there isnt going to be something faster then that besides instant movement atleast we think that right now that might change once we actually hit that tech."
116,"I thought Moore's law was specific to computers and not technology overall. Also though computer development has slowed down due to electrons jumping through logic gates if they get too small, I think quantum computer's get around that problem. I know they aren't really all there yet but they could be the solution to getting back up to speed. I have heard of other cool ideas to beat the problem as well such as using better materials like graphene or restructuring circuit boards to be more efficient."
117,It is specific to computers. It's about how many transistors could fit in a square inch space. We are hitting the limit on that with the current technology. we might be able to make it even smaller and smaller if we have technology for it later. but for now it's broken. But that specifically only aims at transistors we could create an entire different system that could handle way more and have different methods of creation.
118,"A method of building computers that didn't use transistors would require a complete redesign of what we think a computer is from the ground up. And even if it eventually came about, it would *still* hit the same problems with Moore's law. Whatever material you use to make the computer, the only way to make the computer stronger is to add more of its base unit (eg the transistor). If you make your base unit smaller, you can fit more of it in the same space. If you make the computer itself bigger, you can just have more units and not worry about space. But at some point, whatever your base unit is, whether its transistors or unobtanium, you're going to hit up against the laws of physics if you try to make it too small."
119,"No one is saying computers will never stop getting better, only that we haven't gotten there yet. And there are many existing technologies that could already bring us back up to speed. We just haven't decided which direction is most cost feasible and convenient yet. But when customer demand get's high enough you will start seeing new products on the shelves, whether they are 3d circuit boards, graphene enhanced, or whatever."
120,">I think quantum computer's get around that problem. 

No, they don't. Quantum computers are better at certain *specific applications* than regular computers, but they aren't just better in general, they don't completely circumvent the issues with Moore's law, and they'll almost certainly never be produced or marketed for normal consumers. Even perfected they'll probably just be in advanced computer labs."
121,"Moore's law simply states that the number of transistors per square inch of space will double every two years. It has slowed down because when you build too small the electrons that run the thing start misbehaving. Quantum computers don't use electrons but are instead run on qubits which are much smaller and are there fore much more open to miniaturization. 

Now it's possible that quantum computers are not the future, but there is still very much a future. Whether we use super materials like graphene to give our current designs a boost, redesign circuit boards into more efficient 3d models, or do something crazy like switch to wetware (since we still haven't designed a computer that is close to the power of a brain), there is still near limitless room for computing technology to evolve."
122,">Moore's law simply states that the number of transistors per square inch of space will double every two years. 

I *know* what Moore's law states. I'm a software engineer, I've taken the classes on computer architecture. Any system we design for computers is going to run into exactly the same problems. 

>Quantum computers don't use electrons but are instead run on qubits which are much smaller and are there fore much more open to miniaturization. 

This statement is utterly and completely wrong. Firstly, electrons are the smallest individual particles known to man. Quarks might be smaller, but they always exist in groups of 3, never individually. Secondly, Qubits are made of *atoms*, usually phosphorus atoms. They aren't ""smaller than electrons"", and they definitely aren't inherently better than regular computers in all applications. They are better at *a specific subset* of computing problems that scientists are interested in, but they're not going to browse the internet faster, or stream netflix better, or even run plain business software better. They will *never* replace the standard computer, only exist alongside it for researchers in advanced computing labs. 

>Whether we use super materials like graphene to give our current designs a boost

Still hit the same problem as Moore's law

> redesign circuit boards into more efficient 3d models,

Run into problems with heat production and finite max density of computing units

 >or do something crazy like switch to wetware (since we still haven't designed a computer that is close to the power of a brain)

Way off if even possible, and still wouldn't replace standard computers because brains aren't better than computers at everything (though would still be a total game changer if it doesn't kill us).

>there is still near limitless room for computing technology to evolve.

My point is that exponential advancement of computing in particular, but of science generally, *can't go on forever*. There are plenty more advancements to be made, but *eventually* other fields of science will start to run into the same problem particle physics has run into, where further advancement requires something stupid like building a particle accelerator the size of the solar system."
123,"Okay clearly I was mistaken on the size of qubits. However it's your original argument that  transistor miniaturization has slowed down, ergo the rest of computer science will slow down, ergo all area's of science will break it's thousands of years long trend of exponential growth. Putting aside the idea of all sciences being dependent on the continued advancements of computer processing power for a moment. We already have solution's to increasing processing power within the same amount of space. Again I also agree that science will theoretically run out things to study and slow down. My point is Moore's law has nothing to do with it."
124,"That's if Quantum Computers work at all as they depend on certain Quantum Mechanics Ideas being right while others are wrong. They are a good test for figuring out more about Quantum Mechanics though. 
Also there are strong doubts if we can actually get Quantum error down to a usable amount within the limits of physics. Again a great experiment but not yet proven that it can be done."
125,"I think your talking about computers, but I'm talking about technology overall which I think has  been pretty well confirmed.   
https://youtu.be/IxRDRMWyYhE"
126,A 3 minute youtube video by a high schooler doesn't really prove your point unfortunately. A logarithmic curve largely follows an exponential growth at the beginning but eventually plateaus and growth slows. We are pretty much already reaching that point as we're reaching physical limits of computers which is the driver of all of our technology in recent decades.
127,"The video was based on the work of Erik Brynjolfsson an MIT professor and does an excellent job of showing how all area's of technology have followed an exponential growth pattern for thousands of years. Here is another article explaining how different fields of technology build on and advance each other. 
https://singularityhub.com/2016/03/22/technology-feels-like-its-accelerating-because-it-actually-is/
Of particular interest is the section that compares the growth of different sectors that are unrelated to the doubling of transistor counts (which is what Moore's law is based on).
And though computer advancement has slowed in recent years it is likely just a slight dip in the Grand scheme. Whether we go in the direction of quantum computer's, graphene computers https://futurism.com/graphene-computers-work-1000-times-faster-use-far-less-power , wetware computers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_computer
,3d circuit boards, or combinations of all of them and other technologies, computers have many many ways to advance far beyond where they are."
128,Software in the computer industry is a great example of where we can advance by miles still. speed and growth of it almost double's every 2 years. The moment we can realise quantum or graphene computers to be commecially viable is the moment where technology will get a huge burst in improvements since a lot of limitations will be gone then because of the silicon based systems we use now.
129,"I think about that kinda stuff a lot in very similar ways, and it always makes me feel dumb since I'm finding that sort of stuff really cool. Things like 'humans basically conquered mother nature with their houses, and conquered the ocean with boats'. Random stuff like that, with a lot more thought put into how cool it is lol. Humanity is cool as shit."
130,">We have defeated the night

Such an awesome quote"
131,"My joyless ass was just sitting here like ""What about candles though?"""
132,candles suck ass at lighting rooms up compared to a bulb
133,"Oh sure the quality is incomparable, but I Senku was like ""Thomas Edison conquered the darkness and set humanity free from day/night cycle"" and I just felt like that was a bit exaggerated because, as I said before, candles."
134,"I think it's more like, light bulbs has allowed people to *do* things during night. With candles, you can read something in your room or maybe make your way around the house, but compare that to Tokyo or New York, 'the city that never sleeps'. It was less about having a way to see in the night and more night time is not even an issue anymore, hence the usage of 'conquer'"
135,Except that cities had oil lights illuminating the streets before lightbulbs.
136,There's a reason why the darkness is a primal and common fear. What lurks in there is unknown to us. Predators could be lurking there unbeknownst to us.
137,">Even Gen was shocked

[Indeed.](https://i.imgur.com/2XnMnEH.jpg) I like [how they replicated the experiment](https://i.imgur.com/Qeh9X06.jpg) at the end of the episode. [That last scene was simply majestic.](https://i.imgur.com/bpZ0yXw.jpg)

[](#gintamathispleasesme)"
138,"> I like how they replicated the experiment

I'm curious about this one.

It looks like the fire makes the machine move, which then produces electricity and makes the light bulb light up, but how *exactly* does it work?"
139,It's a Stirling engine. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine
140,"There's one guy at my lab that has a desktop model of one of these. You can get it to turn by simply holding it in the palm of your hand, with your body heat! These things really can work with tiny temperature gradients."
141,"I imagine they have to be really well made for the hand thing to work, though, or friction will mess things up."
142,"Yes, it's a precision thing, and this was pretty delicate.

What I'd really like to have is a fluidyne - a Stirling engine that doesn't have any mechanical moving parts, it just uses water as its piston!"
143,"It's a [Stirling engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine), and it looks like the one they used is [this one here.](https://www.stirlingkit.com/products/stirling-engine-double-cylinder-engine-motor-model)

The basic theory is based on the relationship between the temperature of the gas and the amount of volume it takes up. As the temperature of a gas increases, so does its volume, and vice versa. All Stirling engines have a hot side and a cool side. As the hot side is heated, the gas within it expands and drives a piston. This expanding gas is then moved to the cool side, where its volume decreases due to loss of heat energy. The gas is then moved back to the hot side to begin the process again. The piston drives a wheel which which causes it to spin. The spinning wheel is used to power a generator which creates the electricity.


[Here's an animation that shows the movement with two pistons.](https://www.stirlingengine.com/two-piston-animation-detail)  
[It looks like the one shown uses two of these displacer type versions.](https://www.stirlingengine.com/displacer-anim)

[The site I used to double check my memory from intro physics (also labels the parts for the animated images)](https://www.stirlingengine.com/faq/#1)"
144,"Thanks!

I've read about it and watched a few videos about it but you had the simplest explanation, which was exactly what I needed.. Haha"
145,"That's a [sterling engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine), they use the engine to drive the rotor of an (I think) [dynamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo).  I believe the proper thing to read up on would be [Faraday's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction)"
146,"good lord, i love Dr.Stone fridays... a really good anime and there is tons of science on its respective thread on /r/anime"
147,"I really like Gen's expression here. When that shot came on while I was watching the episode, I could only think ""that looks like a man gazing upon the face of God""."
148,"They didn't replicate it, they used it last episode too."
149,I found it really interesting that Gen specified that it was an Edison light bulb. Makes me think he knows more science than he is letting on. Perhaps he became disillusioned with it in the past and this is the spark to renew his passion?
150,"Would it? He saw a filament-like object, which Senku was going to use right after generating electricity. The light bulb is the first thing that comes to mind."
151,"Yeah, ""light bulb"". Not ""Edison light bulb""."
152,Edison light bulb is pretty much the most basic light bulb you could think of.
153,"Yeah, but who fucking calls it an ""Edison light bulb"". How are so many people missing my point. 99% of people would have said ""he's making a light bulb"". It's unusual because Gen said ""he's making an Edison light bulb"". That's my point."
154,"Because its using a japanese bamboo filament, a design which Edison used in his prototype versions."
155,"Right, but Gen *knowing* that doesn't mesh with the persona he's been projecting, which is why I think it's significant."
156,Gen isn't a dumb guy at all. He doesn't have science smart but he knows a lot by himself too.
157,We don't know that. I'm assuming you're a manga reader based on what you've just said. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't use your knowledge of what's going to happen to shoot down theories of anime-only people. It's kind of spoiler-y.
158,"It's not. Gen is a trickster and a pretty famous dude overall. It's not about why he knows it, it's about 'off course he knows it, considering he has the same knowledge level as your standard Japanese high schooler', cause if you didn't know Edison and his Japanese bamboo light bulb is pretty popular stuff in Japan (because you know, he uses JAPANESE bamboo)."
159,Yep just read up on Japan and how famous Edison is there and the statue and shrine. So common knowlage to Japanese not to others.
160,Me too. This series pays a beautiful homage to stuff we take for granted these days.
161,Who knew bamboo could make this much light lol
162,Yeah in reality a torch makes a lot more light than an edison bulb lol
163,"Not to mention that the bamboo twig would almost instantly catch fire and break soon thereafter.

That's why lightbulbs have bulbs around them: To suck all the oxygen out so it won't break within seconds."
164,the manga emphasized that the light as only there for a split second. they dragged it out for dramatic effect.
165,"You _can_ generate some light with enough current through a weak resistor that isn't in a bulb, but yeah that shit burns up pretty quickly.

Not to mention I imagine it's super hard to get a bamboo fiber the perfect length and thickness to do this lol"
166,"Yeah, there are a lot of fortunate coincidence, like the thunderstorm, but I still love it."
167,[Here's what happens with electricity and several different metal wires in the air.](https://youtu.be/kexteGM2V2s)
168,"it wouldn't, and it would generate quite a bit of light, google ""Arc Lamps"", that's also why he made his generator with two discs, because arc lamps need alternating current"
169,"Mate, you have no clue what you are talking about.

First of all, what Senko made is not an arc lamp. An arc lamp is when you bring 2 high temperature electrodes close to each other and use a high voltage pulse to strike an arc. It's [the arc that produces light](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Lichtbogen_3000_Volt.jpg), not the electrodes themselves. Senko wasn't doing that, he was just using the twig to close the circuit. If he just wanted to make a spark he could've just held the electrodes close to one another, no need for a twig.

Secondly, the plasma in an arc lamp is still ridiculously hot and will eat through the electrodes at a frightful pace when it happens under atmospheric conditions. That's why arc lamps either have huge electrodes that slowly get fed into the arc, [or they are enclosed in an inert atmosphere.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Xenon_short_arc_1.jpg)

And lastly, arc lamps don't need AC. They just need an initial high voltage pulse to ionize the gas and after that it really doesn't matter whether you use AC or DC.

And lastly, that generator Senko made is a faraday disk, [which produces DC...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_generator)"
170,"A torch isn't reasonable indoors though, what with all the smoke and soot and big open flame.

But candles and oil lamps are decent."

175,Underrated
176,"Senku remembering that modern society extinguished dark gave me the goosebumps, I love that customary things can be so awesome."
177,"I mean, they did that waaaay before electricity.  Lanterns were used for hundreds of years.  I assume he used the light source for a wow factor, but actually wants to use the electricity as a step to build something more valuable than a single light bulb."
178,Was watching it with a very good sound system. The soundtrack is awesome it brings so much emotion to it
179,Light the night as darkness is begone!
180,I wish the show could stick to stuff like this and leave the edgy villains out of it.

It's a truly awesome thought. Man, this show is fantastic.

Actually we have the opposite problem. Due to light pollution we can no longer see the stars or the other planets of our solar system in cities, even if we use a telescope. To see them we need to travel out of the cities, preferably to the darkest possible spots. 

Having a way to light the darkness is good, but when you cannot turn the light off you get that ugly, blurry, grey-brownish light which covers the entire sky like a veil at night and you cannot see anything. Once, while I was travelling, I ended up in a place so dark that I could literally not see my own nose. There was no moon and there was a very faint light only from the stars. How was the night sky view? It was very beautiful. Truly magnificent actually. I stayed there for a couple of hours in awe.."
208,"Love when out in a Rural area of Alabama up on a ridge line you got out of the light pollution and the sky was spectacular some nights. 
You could also see how the light pollution covered some of the towns so I'm sure even more remote would be even better but the view was so great. 

On the other hand I love my electric city party spots."
209,I was wondering if anyone besides me truly felt the impact of that scene. Looks like I'm not the only one.
210,"Senku's playing modded minecraft while everybody else is playing vanilla, huh? I just realized why I love this show so much, it has that same sort of ""build from scratch"" that so many modpacks have, and it's just as satisfying to watch as it is to play."

226,"Honestly, Dr. Stone gives a very refreshing perspective on the technological age.

Instead of bashing the technology for ""ruining the planet"", Dr. Stone demonstrates that we live in the greatest time period in the history... So far."
227,"Indeed. It's easy to think about how much damage we've done to the environment by over-indulging in certain things, but a surprisingly large number of people who complain about it forget that there was a time before all this - and that it sucked.

Smallpox is a good example - as it is eradicated, we enter into an age where people do not know the trouble it caused, and thus can't appreciate how good it is that we managed to rid ourselves of it."

and yet...everyone's miserable. crazy, isn't it?"
232,"It’s not because of the technology, it’s because of the societal structures we live.

Tsukasa May be a crazy anprim but he’s right in identifying that the modern world had a crap societal structure."
233,"technology is part of the cause of the societal structure we live in though.

eg people today are more isolated than ever, so what do they do? spend time on social media to ""feel connected"" except it's a false feeling of connection so it doesn't actually help at all. why were they isolated in the first place? because we no longer live in communities that depend on eachother, everyone can be an independent entity who does whatever job he wants and just goes to the store to buy food he had no part in gathering and has no relation to the person who gathered it etc."
234,"So the worst thing people today have to deal with that you can think of is isolation? You think they'd prefer living in a time when they have to worry about whether or not their family will fucking starve to death, freeze to death, eaten by tigers, or even straight up dying at birth instead?"
235,"> So the worst thing people today have to deal with that you can think of is isolation?

A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man""."
236,">and yet...everyone's miserable. crazy, isn't it?

Yeah, because people have been raised in this society, are super privileged and take everything for granted.

Even working class people of the first world are living better than kings of the past. If you have clean, hot water, a comfortable bed, climate control, access to supermarkets, modern medicine, the internet, etc. And you can't figure out how to live a relatively happy life, that's a *you* problem."
237,"I actually wonder if the petrification isn't going to be an occasion to delve into that. I think it'd be fair to dig a bit into the dark side of science, as a learning experience - to discuss how we can make a better use of it. It seems a natural conclusion point for this theme. If the petrification was actually an experiment gone awry, or an experimental weapon of some sort, it's certainly an interesting foil to Senku's pure optimism about science. Something he needs to confront and indeed a worthy ""final boss"" for his story."
238,yes welcome to how literature works it sells you on a perspective. Just know that that the cutting edge of philosophy of technology sees it (and history) more gray than the black and white shades most redditors force themselves into.

can you further explain how the whole thing actually worked?"

So to make electricity you will need a force and a magnetic field


As you saw, senku made a magnetic field by inducing the metal with a current which is how one is created, so all he needed was a force within a magnetic field. The force was the movement of the two brothers on the machine, this creates a current/ electricity.

266,Ah a GCSE candidate! Make sure to read up more in electronics and magnetism cause they're gonna double down on it in IAL.
267,"I just did my alevel physics, and from i what i see. The new 9-1 made the GCSEs alot closer to alevels so they'll be less stuff to learn. Another thing to note, it's not just that there is a force but what direction it is in. You can apply alot of force in a specific direction but it won't produce any electricity (freaked me out when i learned that)."
268,"Yeah its best when the force is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field I believe, thanks a lot for this information as I've decided to choose A level physics for my sixth form- so seeing Dr stone just before I start it is a funny coincidence"
269,"It's not specifically about being perpendicular, because it can be perpendicular and still not make any electricity. The force needs to be cutting the magnetic field, if you can imagine what that looks like. I found a level physics to be fun, i really hated waves and optics but i loved the particles and quantum phenomena chapter (the first one you'll do probably)."
270,">really hated waves and optics

This was literally me at GCSE and you're telling me it's going to be harder!?

>It's not specifically about being perpendicular, because it can be perpendicular and still not make any electricity. The force needs to be cutting the magnetic field,

My bad thanks for correcting me on this I always appreciate gaining new knowledge of things I thought I knew or wasn't completely sure on

272,">hated waves and optics


We stand along with you on this. Especially SHM, smh."
273,"In short when a magnet (iron bar) moves past a conductor (the copper circles) the electrons in the conductor sort of move around to follow the magnet as much as possible. Through the electrons trying to follow the magnetic if set up in the right way you can get them to move around an electric circuit creating electricity. 

If connected up right one can get electricity following between the disks connected by two wires (as it needs to go A to B and B to A to complete circuit (as electrons density must be maintained so they move around like water)). By placing the bamboo filament along the wires electricity to moved through to continue to other disk. The bamboo then heats up (but doesn't break apart ) and starts glowing at very high temperatures (due to black body radiation but that's a whole other thing). 

There is jargon and a fair amount of maths but this is an ELI5."
274,"Hey, black body radiation. There's a fun term I haven't heard in a few years~

Took a little bit for me to wrap my head around the concept"
275,is it DC or AC? i thought wires in a bulb use ac so they don't burn out too quickly.
276,In the case of the show it would be DC as spinning of disks creates a constant direction of flow and reversing the spin would make it follow of the other direction. For it to be AC it would need to spin then stop and spin other way endlessly.

278,"For more details: running a current through iron only align then as long as energy is flowing (principle behind electromagnets, however if the iron is heated up it will be able to align those electron permanently while cooling down.

Thunder heat the iron a lot while also creating a huge magnetic field so the heated iron will have its electrons aligned (permanently once it's cooled down)"
279,"Out of curiosity, what would I look up to understand why cooling a still hot magnet would help permanently make it a magnet?"
280,"This page ( http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/lodeston.htm ) talk about this phenomenon and cite the passage talking about it in *de magnete*, that's where I found about it, while searching about wasilewsky

The Wikipedia page about the Curie Point ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature ) also talk about how the material change from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic above that point, and how a magnetic field applied to a paramagnetic material align its magnetic moments, and how the magnetic moments are kept in their position as the material drop under the Curie Temperature.

So basically, when you heat a possibly magnetic material above a point, the moments float, like in a soup, 

when there's a magnetic field (like the earth magnetic field or bigger) more or less moments will align to it (depending on its strength),

 when the material is cooled, the soup solidifies and fix the moments in their position. The material has now a magnetic field about the same strength (or weaker) as the magnetic field who aligned its moments.

So if you try heating a modern iron magnet above the Curie point and let it cool, it will just become way less powerful (since it aligned to the earth magnetism instead of some electromagnets or permanent magnet used when it was made) however an iron with no magnetic properties may aquire some like that"
281,wow ! thanks for the explanation Sorcerer
282,~~Magic~~ sorcery.
283,"Maxwell's equations. In short: there are magnetic fields and electric fields. A magnetic field that changes with time generates an electric field, and an electric field that changes with time generates a magnetic field, and there's a sign in the equations so that if you have a magnetic field that generates an electric field that generates *another* magnetic field, the second magnetic field goes *against* the first (otherwise they'd just explode to infinity). So if you build any kind of conductor and move it through a magnetic field, it will experience a changing magnetic field, which will create an electric field and thus induce a potential (think the electric equivalent of a pump, pushing water uphill so that you can then have it flow down - aka, have a current).

What they built was a [Faraday disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_generator), I believe. Not sure about why they needed twin discs though. Perhaps to stabilise the structure with opposite rotations.

Fun fact: when you learn Einstein's relativity you appreciate just how much magnetic and electric fields are really just two sides of the same 4-dimensional coin. They are all derive from something called 4-potential which in turn is affected by how much charges move in either space (generating magnetic fields) or time (generating electric ones). That's probably hard to wrap your brain around though without studying the math."
284,"Was trying to figure out why they needed two discs as well, and Tesla's ""Dynamo Electric Machine"" ([on the same page as Faraday disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_generator#Homopolar_generator_development)) also used a two parallel disc model. Maybe something similar here?"
285,"Right, but then why prefer the seemingly *more* complicated model?"
286,"Good question and unfortunately I can only speculate that either the less complicated model isn't capable of supplying enough power for the future inventions they're planning, and/or the more complicated model brings with it significantly more efficiency and power and signifies the best they can build with their current constraints."
287,"As I said, my thought was it might involve a structural failure problem. They said the two discs need to be rotated in sync, not sure why. But it could all be tied to the idea that, with those shabby materials, the whole contraption is very unstable and having two discs that rotate in opposite directions helps stabilise it. Otherwise, conservation of momentum would have it tip on one side (and that would end up inevitably happening for a single disc version)."
288,"That was probably not the best way of making electricity from nothing tbh.  I'd probably have used a number of Voltaic piles in series to start, and use them to magnetise my iron for use in a water wheel generator.  You can also use a water wheel to automate bellows pumping to forge the iron."
289,He'll be needing more electricity for sure. This is just the start.

303,"Not that often. Usually most erratas are just optimizing the wording (use less words, better explanation, updated terms, etc.). There are some banned cards that got nerfed and unbanned, but the only cards that got this treatment (so far) were cards that were banned for years, not recent cards."

306,"Yeah I can definitely believe older cards are more prone to it than others, I've seen the old version of Oubilette vs what would be expected of a reprint. I cam into that game right at the end of Scars block, so by that time they had more or less figured out better templating and whatnot."
307,"I'm not sure, but that card definitely hit above its weight class on its own so I shouldn't be surprised, but that's a hard nerf.

I remember, but it doesn't seem to be documented on that site, there was an errata where it didn't affect itself that I thought would still be standing."

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Like, if half his head got un-petrified first, he would be half-petrified and... uh... half his *brain* would still be petrified. And if it's more than 100 years he would be half brain-dead. And even if it's not so long, I can't make sense of wtf would be going on with this partial getting old.

Dr. Stone is just hope incarnate. Even the opening and ending themes all scream this cry of pure HOPE."

Saya no Uta (I haven't read Phantom) is incredibly grim and dark. He said Fate/Zero was freeing for him because no matter what he did, Stay Night already existed to give the work an ultimately happy ending. Madoka too, after everything, ends in a uplifting and hopeful way. Psycho Pass ends up rejecting Makishima's worldview, even if the writing feels a bit enamored with it. In recent years, he's almost completely outgrown his Saya no Uta phase, and is having a lot of genuine fun with his puppet show. It's nice."

411,"The thing about the pacing is that it's... close enough to the real world curve to feel realistic.

Senku goes on and on about 'trial and error', what I've been discussing with my wife as 'failure mode science'. You learn from your mistakes and iterate. Senku's got a huge heads up in that he knows the underlying principles, but he's still bound by that 'failure mode'.

In this episode Senku mentioned Edison, and while reddit loves to shit on the guy **[because of the oatmeal comic](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla)** (which i would say is quite biased by minimizing Edison role to *""lol he was nothing more than a lightbulb seller""*), he really deserves the credit here. **[It is Edison and his japanese bamboo fiber filament for the lightbulb](https://www.amusingplanet.com/2019/05/how-japanese-bamboo-helped-edison-make.html)** that advanced the lightbulb technology, even if other scientist were working with lightbulbs too. A lightbulb lasting 1200 hours would be unthinkable before that. His use of japanese bamboo fibers is celebrated in Japan, as the link shows.

437,"> reddit loves to shit on the guy because of the oatmeal comic (which i would say is quite biased by minimizing Edison role to ""lol he was nothing more than a lightbulb seller"")

That's not even the worst part. Westinghouse (who was Edison's main competitor in the War Of The Currents (DC vs. AC)) isn't even mentioned, Tesla's revolutionary three-phase AC motor (which runs most industrial machinery) is virtually a footnote, instead of being given a top billing, as it should have over stuff *nobody* has been able to replicate (it's not science if you can't replicate it), J.P. Morgan didn't get namedropped as the financier who wasn't down with Tesla's free electricity idea (gee, maybe it's because there's still a very wealthy company with his name on it?), etc.

I like Tesla, and I've studied even some of the most crackpot accounts of his incredible stuff, but that comic is ridiculously biased, and grants credence to some rather dubious reports of what he managed to do, while drilling down Edison for kicks and virtually ignoring (or at least not naming) any of the other players Tesla came into collision with.

Yes, it's clear Edison was generally an asshole, and screwed over other inventors as hard as possible (at one point during the DC vs. AC struggle he paid journalists to refer to execution via electric chair as ""getting Westinghoused""), but that comic is hilariously biased against him, when there are *plenty* of other targets if you're running down the list of people who messed with Tesla.

It wasn't just Edison v. Tesla. (Which is unfortunately the popular opinion.)"

Now with oxygen a fire would break out immeadiatly the bamboo wire would burn away almost in a flash (the anime dragged the scene out), but the light would be very very bright."

445,There's plenty of reason to hate Edison beyond his dealings with the light bulb. He was a litigious piece of shit that tried to control all cinema through patents and having goon squads come beat the shit out of you and steal your equipment if he found out you were putting anything to film without his direct permission. It's the reason why Hollywood/California is the film center of the world. He drove the rest of the industry across the country to get away from him.

451,"Tesla was an actual scientist, and probably one of the most intelligent minds in human history (at least according to Einstein). Edison was just a really smart guy who tried everything and stuck with what worked, an inventor if you might (but then again it's not an easy task on itself)."
452,">  Edison was just a really smart guy



> Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor.[1][2][3] He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures.[4] These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world.[5] He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory.[6] 

>  Edison was just a really smart guy"
453,"That's the definition of a really smart guy who worked hard. Congrats, you expanded my sentence without adding anything new."
454,"It is interesting to note that with advanced electronics and switching units DC has actually become the most efficient way to transport electricity recently. High voltage DC power transmission can carry massive amounts of power with smaller wires and up to 40% lower transmission losses than AC.

456,"Senku needs a nice big river, a bit of hydro power would help out a ton of his experiments"
457,"Hydropower sounds more modern-age, except for maybe water powered windmills."
458,People started making water mills in 300bc. Senku could make one with about as much effort as he did his pulley system.
459,"Interesting, I was just making a guess - didn't realise it was that old. Thanks."
460,"I've been thinking the next step for electricity is to make either a hydro powered generator or a wind powered one. Given the current generator I would say it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to convert it into a water or wind powered one, would save manpower for other tasks too."
461,"Ya that was my thought, kinda how they use to do grinding mills"
462,"Honestly doesn't seem like it would be too hard to use a waterfall or something to power those bellows for the iron smelter. 

Make a water wheel, then convert that to up and down motion and you're good to go."
463,">except for maybe water powered windmills.

...

>water powered windmills.

...

That's what we call a watermill my dude.

But nah, it's pretty simple.

Think of it this way: a generator just needs rotation, it doesn't matter where it comes from. A water wheel is just wood on an axel placed into water. No harder to build than a basic house."
464,"Yeah I didn't know what the actual name was, thanks."
465,fcking manga reader with his spoilers
466,"like the other person commenting said, water mills have been around for a long time. Like the name suggests, they were used for things like milling flour. But you don't necessarily have to use it to mill flower, you essentially just have a rotating gear that you can hook up to whatever you want. In the case of hydro-power you would hook it up to a generator to spin around magnets making power."
467,One of those big wheel house generators would do nicely if he had access to it.
468,"Honestly, I'm not sure a low power steam engine is out his reach, even without iron.

If he has enough copper for those disks, he has enough to make a cylinder. He could make a [multitube boiler](https://cdn.hswstatic.com/gif/steam-boiler-ft-a.gif) from clay and provided he kept the temperature of the fire down, he should be able to keep it running in same way bread ovens could be used over and over. He could use soft metal tubes like the copper if the clay ones didn't work. The only rub I can see is making a tight enough seal to push the rod."

470,"1) Senku does pull a lot of scummy tactics, but don't think that Tsukasa isn't smart enough to catch on it. Senku has the book smarts, but Tsukasa has far greater instincts, so trapping him is extremely hard in and of itself. He would've probably caught on very fast if Senku tried to lie about the formula.    
2) Senku isn't the type to use poison, and it isn't an easy task to create a safe tranquilizer, especially for supernaturally strong men line Tsukasa.    
3) Also a lot of the problems you mention gets clarified by the show sooner or later, don't get too impatient."
471,[deleted]
472,"1. It doesn't take lie detection or spider sense to avoid getting lured into a trap or be careful when using a recipe from someone you just murdered.
2. Sulfur antibiotics are very simple compared to a safe tranquilizer not to mention he could probably just snatch the dart out of thin air. The crossbow wouldn't have killed him if it wasn't somewhere vital especially with how weak it was."
473,"Anti-biotic isn't too difficult compared to a safe tranquilizer. Especially if you wanted to create a tranquilizer strong enough to completely knock out Tsukasa, you'd need a ton of more resources than you'd need for a sulfamide drug, it just has way more complex structure and production route. Another problem of tranquilizers is that it can very easily become lethal if the wrong dose is been given, and Senku has no way to know what a safe dose for Tsukasa will be, you need an actual professional anaesthetist for that. Senku does have limits fyi."

Japan has about 600 varieties (there are over 1000 known varieties of bamboo) so there were a number of choices which were to be considered for tests to find the best filament material.

The type of bamboo that was chosen was from Yawata and is known as Ma-dake (this is also used in high quality kendo shinai). This Yawata madake was used to make filaments that lasted 2450 hours (remember the cotton was only 40 and Edison's fan material lasted 200 hours)."

604,Can someone remind me what happened to Taiju and Yuzuriha?  Senku mentioned Taiju and Tsukusa in the same sentence in this episode and it sounds like they’re together but I don’t know what episode that happened in.
605,They went to live (as spies) to Tsukasa's kingdom in episode 6.
606,They're pretending Senku is dead to keep Tsukasa quiet.
607,"Which is funny, because, as proven by Gen's presence, Tsukasa ain't buying it."
608,"They left at the end of the episode where they saved Senku's life. The plan was that they would meet up with Tsukasa and keep an eye on him, which he would allow because they would be useful to have around."
609,"When Senku said “are you afraid of the night?”

I felt that 😩🙏🙌😭😭💯💯💯"
610,Senku's lack of using a waterwheel in the stream to pump air into his blast furnace and how he overlooked using a rope/vine as a drive/timing belt for his generator makes me think that he may be a scientist but he's definitely not an engineer
611,"Waterwheel requires specialized iron tools and more importantly, a shitton of time. They are running against the clock with Ruri's illness, and even though a waterwheel is a better choice on the long run, a manually operated power generator is much much easier and faster to create."
612,"He could've built a wooden or bamboo waterwheel in the stream to run a [impeller bellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyGLE0usN_I) to keep air going into his furnace

And the generator wheels could be kept in sync with a set of vine/rope drive belts and simple wooden [differentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYAw79386WI) instead of looking for people who can turn them in perfectly in sync

What I'm saying is that he's leaving free energy on the table for building an [ever-growing factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVvXv1Z6EY8)"
613,Senku likes girls who can blow hardcore.
614,This anime is about appreciating the things we neglect in our everyday lives. So beautiful.
615,"That lightning scene.


Wouldn't the bar of iron be extremely hot for senku to just run up and grab it?


Also i forget the name but standing near a lightning strike can still get you affected by it even if it doesn't directly touch you, so in theory everyone there would end up with some burns or scars"
616,"They could have set the pole, gotten far away for a while, and come back to collect the completed magnets, but that would have been less dramatic so they didn't. It's not like they accomplished anything they couldn't actually do, they just made it a bit more dramatic than having them sit in the woods for a while waiting for it to be done."
617,If it were that realistic then probably the iron couldn't have been forged either but here we are.
618,"> Also i forget the name but standing near a lightning strike can still get you affected by it even if it doesn't directly touch you, so in theory everyone there would end up with some burns or scars

Anime science is not true science. I think this series would've been even more epic if everything outside the petrification was super realistic."
619,Ultra Realism ruins the purpose of animation and it's liberties. Dr.Stone us already realistic enough in what it is. It wouldn't have been epic at all.
620,That's certainly true.
621,">Anime science is not true science

The whole point of THIS show is to have true Science so I think this is a valid Question still since the show is actually quite realistic in it's Science"
622,It is but I don't expect this show to go by without some dubious shit. It's be really cool though if they eventually show if the petrification is somehow real science or if it's pure fantasy.
623,">if the petrification is somehow real science or if it's pure fantasy.

All I can tell you is that you'll find the answer very exhilarating"
624,I've been reading the newer chapters but missed all the stuff in between so I'm super excited to see the anime cover that.
625,i sense a [saber face](https://imgur.com/V1SIVs0) :D
626,"With the yellow light making her blue eyes appear green, she really does look like [Mordred](https://i.imgur.com/4DFBUgz.jpg)."

Then again, the plate bra is not exactly realistic."

631,"Would have been a LOT simpler to just make a better air pump, just sayin'."
632,But Senku wants to see girls pumping air into a furnace
633,"You can still make a pump and have girls manning it. Just make up an excuse for why you need big tiddies to operate it, those villagers ain't the brightest bunch."
634,"That final scene was so inspiring, to what? I don't know but it was inspiring"
635,Didn't think I'd get a little emotional just watching some characters make a light bulb but this show did it. It was so well done!
636,Actually cried at the end
637,How come they are making a generator instead of antibiotics?
638,It's on the roadmap to antibiotics.
639,They need electricity to progress in the roadmap Senku drew in the last weeks episode.
640,it's a quest chain. He needed to complete this quest before going to the next one in the Antibiotics quest line.
641,Chicks are temporary but science is eternal!
642,"God, the ending bit was beautiful. The first light in 3.7k years!

...and so bright that I doubt Tsukasa didn't see it. Senku's just screwed himself over by trying to flex that he's got electricity."
643,"Tsukasa is over 80km away from them, they are fine."
644,"""Gen, I'm going to win you over with science so that you don't let Tsukasa know I'm alive.""

""What, this super-bright light bulb that only I could have made with science? Hell yeah, let's light it up somewhere high up and super-visible."""
645,Tsukasa's camp is like fifty miles away or something. They could put a torch on top of that mountain peak and it wouldn't show up that far away.
646,I thought the show started hard. I am really enjoying it now.
647,"God the music in this series is phenomenal. Both during the lightning storm and during the light bulb scene, super enthralling."
648,"Random girl: What kind of girls do you like?  
Senku: A girl who can pump a ton of oxygen into the furnace.  
  
So basically a girl who can blow stuff.."
649,"Oh man, I love how they portrayed this. It's such an important achievement of humanity that enabled so much progress, and the way it was animated and acted here is breathtaking. It's restrained and almost subtle.

Fucking hell do I love this show."
650,"This show is so god damn amazing

Demon Slayer gets me hyped but this show just keeps so fascinated. The appreciation for the simplest things humans have done in the world."
651,GEN! Easily top 3 characters. Lowest I’ll accept is top 5
652,It's so cool to watch a shonen where the hypest moment of a season is a glowing twig instead of a fight scene.
653,"So when Senku have some new idea, that bulb will probably make its appearance again"
654,"My question is why did Senku give the unpretrification formula? He was put in a corner, but there’s no way Tsukasa could have verified. Also, why didn’t he just go on and make the guns he originally was going to make? There would be no worry at that point"
655,"Well, if he really died, at least the knowledge of reviving people won't be lost together.  Senku's goal is to revive everyone, regardless of whether by him or someone else.

Most of the gunpowder were lost in the fight, and he doesn't have access to the cave for ingredients to make more."
656,"And if he lied, Tsukasa would use it on one person, to see it fail. Senku wants to save ALL of humanity. Letting Tsukasa accidentally kill one is a non-starter to him."
657,Science does not lie
658,">Science does not lie

[This snake disagrees](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/28/article-2641537-1E43939A00000578-8_634x591.jpg)"
659,"He doesn't have the Nitric acid he needs for the gunpowder, as Tsukasa is in control of the cave right now. Additionally guns would require a lot more build up, he only just got to make a block of iron."
660,"Tsukasa already has a good idea of the contents of Senku's 'lab'. All he needed were the right proportions. He would've definitely caught onto any lies, cause Senku is just a bad liar in general. He's very much a straightforward person, just like Taiju, only difference being that he's smart."
661,"It’s triggering me that they’re crediting Edison with the lightbulb. My American homeboy merely improved upon an existing product and patented it and later went on to make it much cheaper, turning a common prototype into a household thing. 

But he sure as hell didn’t pioneer that shit. Ya boi  Ebenezer Kinnersley was most likely the one who came up with it around 1760s. That idea was then passed down to Humphry Davy who gave it his best shot. James Bowman Lindsay realized you needed to give it a constant voltage. Claimed he could read a book about a foot away from his bulb. Only then did Joseph Swan and  Edison vastly improve it with some carbon filament wires and vacuuming the bulbs out with a pump around the 1880s. Cmon, Senku get your shit together, man."
662,"Edison is the first recorded use of *bamboo* as a filament, so this *would* be an ""Edison bulb."" Also, it was Gen who called it that, and he would be less well researched."
663,Our Best Boy of 2019 has finally arrived !
664,Wow such a interesting episode
665,"#IT'S ALI—  
  
oh wait, no, too soon."
666,Anybody saw kurita from eyeshield 21 at 17:32. the lineman that say funuraba.
667,It was a great reference. Came out of nowhere. I heard the author of Dr. Stone is the same one of Eyeshield 21 so that makes sense.
668,"Good episode, I'm loving the empire building stuff."
669,Love it when Kinro and Ginro are in serious mode. So different from happy-go-lucky ~~golden spear~~ ^^RIP mode.
670,"Holy crap they invented electricity already.

That escalated quickly."
671,Man this Asagiri maybe really untrustworthy but man can he talk people into doing things. To bad Kinro he may have lost his golden spear however it went to good use.
672,[deleted]
673,"Thorkell, but if you're not a manga reader, explaining why would be spoilers."
674,"Man I love this anime, that twig moment was golden"
675,"9 episodes in and it's stayed pretty true to the manga. I love the colors in this show, everything is very well balanced. Like it's bright but its not, you know?"
676,"Emet-selch, is that you!?!

Great episode as always, the ending was especially illuminating"
677,"Omg yes, Gin reminds me a lot about Emet, hopefully not the same ending :3"
678,Thank you
679,The crank engine is cool but I'm a little confused by why he didn't just build a steam engine? It would require minimal man power and there's plenty of wood for coal. Is there some benefit I'm missing or is this just a plot beat to get the guards on their side?
680,he got limited materials and manpower atm. He is just speedrunning tech with the most minimal effort/resources
681,"I'm not sure the minimum development it would take to make a functioning steam engine. I mean a ""semi modern"" steam engine would require building some fairly sturdy and balanced gearing, and a fairly strong pressure vessel. Maybe whatever design he could build himself right now would fall apart too quickly."
682,"Honestly this was a smart episode. Although I'm surprised by the design of the generator. I expected it to simply be a really big capacitor, or a solenoid generator using a magnetic field to generate an electric field in the wire. I really couldn't say how that design works and wish they could have told us a bit about it."
683,I forget if they explain it more in later chapters. [Something like this maybe?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homopolar_generator)
684,That would be it. Seems really inefficient. Moving the magnet through a big copper coil and building charge on copper plates/capacitors would have made more sense. But regardless this show is going into some really great stuff.
685,Maybe this generates more power using the scales and speeds available to them.
686,"No fucks were given that day by the science team about the dangers of being thunderstruck.

I need to consult the society building map to see what's next after electricity. 

You'd think with the threat of Tsukasa looming over, weapons would be the priority over antibiotics, or did I miss something. You can't make antibiotics if the lion puncher comes after you, lol."
687,"He's doing it save Kohaku's sister. Its the reason why Chrome and Kohaku are helping him in the first place, and he also wants to unravel the mystery behind why she has knowledge that only people from the modern world should have. 

Also, he's making stuff like the lightbulb along the way there, and antibiotics are actually really important in the stone world where's theres no proper hygiene or medical care."
688,"I get all that, all I'm saying that all of that is pointless if Tsukasa would show up and they didn't have weapons because they prioritized something else."
689,"Yeah, but Tsukasa won't show up as long as they get Gen on their side. And getting things like iron will be eventually useful to creating weapons."
690,Gotta try Cola with ramen before possible Stonification then
691,The best character has been introduced.
692,Asagiri gen ..sosaruse korewa!!
693,Now I want a anime about Thomas Alva Edison inventing electricity bulb ..
694,"It would be more an anime about Edison stealing the idea for the light bulb though, like most everything else he was credited with"
695,Dont guys think suika's voice is cute?
696,Couldn't senku make a simple gear system to spin the generator with one handle instead of 2? It would make operation easier and doesn't require 2 people to be in perfect sync
697,I think just making the gear design is far harder than just making two circular discs. Granted it's an anime and they can just do whatever but logically if you have this primitive civilization to work with it's easier to beat a piece of metal into a circle than a gear.
698,You can make gears with a stick and a branches ( like the muscle generator thing senku said) it doesn't have to be metal
699,"So I'm late to the party, but I have to get this off my chest:

IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING EYESHIELD REFERENCE!!?

*One google search later...*

Son of a bitch! So this is what Inagaki has been up to! I didn't even realize it until now! Now I've got another reason to love this show."
700,"Another good episode.

The great thing was I had a thunder storm overhead while the episode played which made the lightning scenes feel extra thematic."
701,I want Kohaku to touch my spear.
702,"Yeah, science!"
703,Wasn't there only 1 iron bar on the spear when the lightning strike? Then suddenly Kohaku was holding 2 magnets in her hand. I don't get it.
704,I think they split the rod in half.
705,can someone explain how that generator works
706,"Fleming's left hand rule

Generators and motors are actually incredibly similar

For both you need a ""force, electricity, and magnetic field""

For the generator senku needs a force and a magnetic field in order to make electricity, which is why he gets lighting to strike the iron because the electricity in the iron will cause it to make magnetic field


And then he needs a force which is the movement of the brothers

With those two things he makes electricity


A motor is just electricity and a magnetic field making a force

Generator: Wind turbines 

Motor: Propellers"
707,"It still doesn't make sense to me. In essence, Senku is basically producing electricity using induction. A rotating copper element causes a change in electromagnetic field, converting kinetic energy to electricity. 

However, this only produces electricity while the copper discs are turning, no? The bulb shouldn't stay alight unless the brothers are turning the wheels 24/7

And why are two discs, in sync at that, required?"
708,it's a coupled Faraday Disc
709,"> this only produces electricity while the copper discs are turning, no? The bulb shouldn't stay alight unless the brothers are turning the wheels 24/7

Yes.

I dunno about the two discs though."
710,Fair enough
711,"It would be pretty funny that the brothers are probably still turning the wheel during the duration of the light bulb experiment offscreen almost dying exhaustion (actually the manga had that happen in a small side panel)

They probably don't need to turning it 24/7, for now it probably only needs to be turned when the generator is actively being used to power something at the time

They also mentioned that the in synch thing is for not breaking the machine itself, if it's unbalanced the machine would probably be shaking around a lot at those speeds like an unbalanced centrifuge probably"
712,"> The bulb shouldn't stay alight unless the brothers are turning the wheels 24/7

You would be surprised at how easy it is to make a huge capacitor."
713,How easy?
714,"As easy as having paper, wax and a wire."
715,"Or a pot, some copper wire, iron and some acid (vinegar, fruit juice, ect)"
716,"[I believe they made a homopolar generator](https://skullsinthestars.com/2014/08/27/physics-demonstrations-faraday-disk/) , its pretty simple in construction, just need a magnet next to a spinning conducting disk and you can make electricity (assuming you can get a wire from the edge and a wire from the center)"
717,"Why did the two discs have to be spun at the same speed though? They are probably connected in series, so there shouldn't be any problem with that."
718,"The Faraday disc generator normally produces an electric current by setting up a potential difference between the edge of the disc and the center.  The problem is the edge of the disk is spinning, so to maintain the edge in electrical contact, Faraday tensioned a contact against the disk with a flat spring (i.e. a primitive electric brush). 

My guess is that Senku didn't have a way to create an effective electric brush without a metal spring (maybe wood isn't good enough?), so instead he's setting up a potential difference between the centers of the two Faraday disks by rotating them in the opposite direction.  As long as they were rotating at the same speed, there wouldn't be any excess current built up."
719,They gave the lightning a bit of personality by adding a bit of a growl to its thunder
720,You know.....lighting up a bulb in a stone world is probably not a good idea.  If just one other person was sent it would confirm Senku is alive.
721,Thomas Who-dison?
722,is that a 21 eyeshield references?
723,"It is, Eyeshield 21 is the authors previous work."
724,"Cool, thanks :)"
725,What was the reference? Never read/watched Eyeshield.
726,"Great episode as always, but i still can't shake off the feeling that the kind of generator built by Senku & co would not work. It doesn't even show where the terminals are (in theory they should be touching the copper disks). Anyone has a better idea how it would work?

Not to mention that when they turn on the ""lights"", the generator isn't running (or doesn't seem to)"
727,the generator is running when they light it
728,The 2 terminal are connected to the copper disk. You can see 2 small bamboo sticks on the bottom of the platform holding the 2 wires
729,Anyone else noticed the eyeshield 21 reference when senku mentioned the generator was muscle powered?
730,How long does the anime runs ? 12 ep or more ??
731,24 episodes this season.
732,"I love this show, when they got light at the end that was an incredible moment!"
733,"Great episode. The reference to Eyeshield 21 in the minute 17:34 was so great too.

This series just keeps getting better and better."
734,whats the sound called at the beginning? the ramen sound?
735,"The *charumera* is a [shawm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawm)-like instrument traditionally associated with this kind of noodle cart in Japan, like an early form of food truck. I suspect it appears more on TV than real life these days."
736,"Senku: *Makes iron*

Lighting: *Delicious, finally some goof fn food*"
737,Love how Kurita from eyeshield 21 was shown in of the manpower examples
738,Loved
739,"With each episode, Kohaku gets closer and closer to the top of my waifu list. 

Senku’s pretty fucking badass too, goddamn makin’ lightbulbs in the stone age."
740,Such a great fucking episode
741,"gen is a sly dude, seems like they just glossed over the fact he was originally with tsukasa. good amount of funny moments this episode"
742,Is there any information about the science experiments that are in the previews
743,EXHILIRATING
744,EXHILARATING!!!!
745,Eyeshield 21's kurita in da house
746,the ending scene with the light paired up with the OST was simply beautiful
747,Man i teared up near the end there.
748,the BGM for the first 15min of this episode is very annoying. anyone feeling the same?
749,"This episode was pretty touching, especially when the last part.
But I'd rather they credited someone's else instead of Edison. Y'know, him being more of a scumbag than an inventor."
750,i hope with the future episodes senku gives a nod to nikola tesla with the current inventions he's making and he seems like such an inspiration point for the character as well in my opinion
751,Holy fuck what an ending
752,Where did Gen get his clothes?
753,Why did you switch to Like/Dislike? It's not as accurate.
754,What a magical moment! The first light bulb made with science :)
755,[deleted]
756,"Senku, to his credit doesn't seem to WANT to kill Tsukasa. His entirety of WHY he wanted the gunpowder was to intimidate Tsukasa into giving up so he wouldn't have to kill him. Tsukasa decided ""lawl, let's do this shiz"""
757,[deleted]
758,"Senku ain't the man to make poison, he's just not that kind of person. Also Tsukasa caught a freaking crossbow bolt flying at him while simultaneously using the momentum to kick Taiju, you seriously think his ultra instincts can be beat using blowdarts?"
759,[deleted]
760,"The idea of intimidating Tsukasa became pointless the moment Tsukasa got the formula. He's not against a single person anymore, he's against an army that possibly shares his ideals. Okay, kill Tsukasa, then what. Kill the next Tsukasa, and the next one, and the next one, until there are no Tsukasas left, eh?

Without access to the cave, Senku's only real option is to either convince them to leave Tsukasa with the power of science, or get an army on his side big enough to oppose."
761,[deleted]
762,"Senku doesn't kill. And if you wanted to sedate a monster like him using tranqs, you'd need extremely strong compounds, and Senku doesn't have the material or the machines needed to create those. Senku's entire plan hinges on making the enemy surrender without killing anyone."
763,No Taiju means it was a good episode.
764,"Ugh, I already hate this Asaragi dude."
765,Let There Be Light
766,Let there be light!
767,"unpopular opinion but im not a fan of the random fanservice, its shows up in wildly in appropriate times (like the spear scene from this episode) doesnt last long enough or go hard enough for it to be sexually capitalized on by the viewer, yet its there enough to make watching it in company ruin your reputation/ induce cringe.

if your going to be lewd either commit to it or dont even bother"
768,"This show is pretty underwhelming, I really don't enjoy how the primitive people interact like modern humans."
769,Their village was likely founded upon modern humans over maybe a few hundred years or even less. The idea that they'd be guaranteed to interact completely different is insane. Humanity wasn't there the entire time people were(and still are) in stone.
770,"there's probably a reason tbh, and honestly, it wouldn't be as good if it was Senku and a bunch of cavemen, He needs characters to bounce off of"
771,FFS SENKU IT WAS TESLA NOT EDISON.
772,Tesla came up with fluorescent bulbs which helped give birth to LED's. Edison was first to the filament bulb.
773,[Not really](https://www.amusingplanet.com/2019/05/how-japanese-bamboo-helped-edison-make.html)
