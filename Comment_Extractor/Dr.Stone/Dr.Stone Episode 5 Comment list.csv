1,"Wow, that mentalist on the cover of that book one of those guys was reading seems like a pretty cool guy. He looks like he likes Coke too."
2,"It’s interesting how he has been in the opening, so viewers may recognize him, where readers are not likely to pay much attention to him. Cool foreshadowing either way."
3,I didn't notice until I went back because I felt I read the first couple of issues real quick. Nice to go back.
4,"""that book's absolute trash"" I love how Senku shit-talks him this early"
5,"Does the pacing seem inappropriate for anime to anyone else? I feel like the anime is taking forever [](/s ""to get to the island, what I would consider where the story starts to really pick up. I really feel like for the anime we should have gotten to the island by episode 5 (for the record that's a pace of about 4 chapters per episode the island is introduced in chapter 20)."")

[](/s  ""I know the pacing is about the same as the manga, but I just don't feel like it works for the anime quite as well. At this pace we may not even meet Kohaku till episode 7 or even 8. And I think that's a real shame. That's over half the cour without even introducing one of the main characters. I'm not saying we need JoJo's 4 chapters per episode all the time but maybe to at least introduce the real heroine and the excellent supporting cast pretty early on?"")

But what do you guys think? I definitely am still enjoying the anime a lot, probably a solid 8/10 for me right now, I just feel like with some adjustments to the pacing it could be amazing."
6,I think that it's just this part of the manga that was slow. The anime adapts 3 chapters per episode. I didn't think we were going to be finished with the prologue in just 5 episodes.
7,Yeah pacing does seem kinda slow tbh.
8,"It's the same pacing as the manga as you said, but this set up is absolutely important as it sets up everything to come."
9,"I was waiting for the senku's eye number counter expression while calculating those seconds, but that didn't happen.... but we get a super shiny monkey, so everything's alright XD"
10,It also lacks the outward zoom to earth when he lit fire for the first time. It was breathraking in the manga. Oh well
11,"They sure like to tease us after Senku's aparent dead and then half the episode being about his awakening and first days in the Stone world.

P.s: That free style rap from when he was crafting the tools… fucking amazing."
12,"Yeah, like at least finish the episode with him opening his eyes! It is not like anyone is still thinking that he is dead."
13,"Well, [he never closed them](https://i.imgur.com/Zag8OY2.jpg) in the first place. Guess [he might have wished they were closed](https://i.imgur.com/drS0m0p.jpg) though.

[](#cantbehelped)"
14,Wow I never noticed that his eyes were open the whole time
15,"People's eyes don't close when they die, so that doesn't really prove much. 

Obviously he's not dead, but that's just not a key to him being alive."
16,They are saying when he wakes his eyes will be very dry
17,10 Billion percent drier eyes
18,bet you can use this for science somehow
19,"Got dry, itchy eyes? Clear it up, with clear eyes."
20,not if it's raining though.
21,Didn't realize that Taiju was related to Chew.
22,Is this a reference to the comic?
23,It's a reference to [this motherflipper.](https://i.imgur.com/lx2oH8H.jpg)
24,...Oh. Not the comic then.
25,Lmao that lippy boi from one piece
26,"Important to note that his name is ""Chu"" as in the kissing sound/onomatopoeia in Japan."
27,Are you sure? I don't have the databook myself but Chew was the referenced official romanized spelling when I checked.
28,"I checked Artur's Vivre card translations and indeed, his name was written as ""Chew"", though much like ""Level Li"" I take Oda's Romanizations with a grain of salt."
29,"It's pretty obvious they're gonna bring him back but damn, I didn't expect him to stay dead for an entire episode. That's 2 whole weeks of dead Senkuu!"
30,"I didn’t expect him to take a chop to the neck like that, and then have there be a meaningful explanation to explain how he’s going to live it. The dude who made this manga is playing 5d chess and I love it"
31,"I mean, I love the manga, I love the anime, I love Senku and this might sound rude but it bothers me how you feel like this level of planning ahead is 5d chess when it's nothing compared to actual 5d chess stories."
32,It’s a hyperbole but this is still really good ~~storyboarding~~ writing
33,Storyboarding? What does that have to do with it?
34,"the other reply to my comment sums what i mean nicely. No need to read so much into this lol

\>There was no logical way he could have justified Senku surviving that blow. So Inagaki sensei used the only thing not explained by science that exists in the manga to save Senku. Just amazing."
35,"There was no logical way he could have justified Senku surviving that blow. So Inagaki sensei used the only thing not explained by science that exists in the manga to save Senku. Just amazing. 

Sasuga Inagaki sama"
36,exactly my point rt
37,[removed]
38,"Plot twist: Senkuu got isekai'd, but it's the exact same world only a few months earlier.

YOU NEVER EXPECT THE ISEKAI TWIST"
39,Subaru every time he dies.
40,and that's why Subaru and Senku shares the same voice
41,I love ~~Emilia~~ science
42,"Omfg, how have I been watching anime for this long and still be this bad at Japanese voices. Like I've nearly been watching anime as a full weeb for over a decade, c'mon man, this is 10 billion percent embarrassing"
43,\*insert witch sound*
44,They invent a bus just so he can get hit by one to get sent into the isekai
45,"He can't be isekai'd. He hasn't reinvented the automobile yet, much less truck-kun."
46,"Could be him in spirit or something, Gurren Lagann had Kamina in the OPs too"
47,"I need that freaking rap, the whole OST is gold."
48,"This was unexpectedly, to me at least, the best episode so far. I'm not usually a fan of flashback episodes, but this fit in perfectly timing wise, and answered a few plot questions from the first episode that I forgot I had."
49,I liked the monkeys mocking him.
50,The flashback isn't over! So look forward to that.
51,and they didn't even explain why he still has some rock on his neck left over. did he put it there? did he just leave it there?
52,I'm guessing he left it there because it wasn't really an issue besides him constantly cracking his neck maybe?
53,I guess a little armor on a weak point is better than no armor at all.
54,"He left it there. They just recently discovered the miracle water and considering its limited supply, I guess he didn't think it was worth it to use it on a minor inconvenience."
55,I like they foreshadow that not all of the body will become unpetrified with her foot.
56,most everyone so far has had some. yuzuriha had some on her leg or foot and tsukasa has some on his hair.
57,Free style rap? What?
58,Rap was by Hybrid Thoughts..they were also on the Kekkai Sensen and Beyond OST
59,"Yeah I didn't need half an episode of flashbacks, I already filled in that blank spot in my mind."
60,"> half the episode being about his awakening and first days in the Stone world.

I really didn't like how they ""re-arranged"" this, why isn't this in like episode 1 you know. I'm trying to see the point, but meh, they just ruin the adrenaline and emotional impact in reviving Senku."
61,"There is a really good reason for the flashback to be placed at this point and time, you'll see next episode."
62,"Honestly, this is how it was in the manga too. It'll all be explained no worries. Promise."
63,"I quite like the idea and everything, but the conflict feels just way to forced that I can not laugh  at it."
64,"The god damn monkey commentary for this episode was something else.  
  
The two old monkeys gave me some [Statler and Waldorf vibes.](https://i.imgur.com/qTunlAH.gif)"
65,"[Yakuza Monkey](https://i.imgur.com/L6HByIA.png) are [the best!](https://i.imgur.com/OT7hfqh.png)

[](#wow)"
66,Chin Chin!
67,*ppfffffffftttttt*
68,"If you're referencing Speed Racer, I believe it was Chim Chim.
Gotta love a kid and his monkey spending all their time in the trunk of a race car eating candy."
69,Why am I instantly reminded of Aoki and Takamura...
70,The fact that they had Kansai accents made it even better.
71,haha yes
72,">The two old monkeys gave me some [Statler and Waldorf vibes.](https://i.imgur.com/qTunlAH.gif)

That's also what I was thinking about. Having absolutely no faith in the shiny monkey"
73,Is it too obvious to be said that they were just Senku's self doubt?
74,Get that nasty peepee outta here!
75,"Definitely liking that Yuzuriha brings something to the table and isn't just someone to be rescued. 

Tsukasa should've been suspicious that Senku easily gave up. Dude always has a back up plan."
76,"According to what Senku said during this episode, Yuzuriha appears to have superhuman dexterity, just as Senku has superhuman intellect, and Taiju has superhuman durability. I'm willing to bet in the next few episodes, she's going to do something ridiculous, like invent pillows, or sew up a bunch of outfits for them to wear."
77,"If they already have the deer hides, string, and sharp rocks, clothing shouldn't be that hard for her to make"
78,Maybe she’ll make a Buddha out of clay or paint the Mona Lisa. Something like that.
79,"Dunno about the next few episodes, but she'll definitely do some ridiculous stuff."
80,Then she'll talk about how she could rival athena
81,"Manga reader here. I can tell you right now it ain't gonna be in a few episodes, dude.
Those are some *interesting* guesses though"
82,[removed]
83,[removed]
84,"I mean I hardly spoiled anything, what I said is both true and false, you'll have to wait and see."
85,You have to be brain dead in order not to understand the meaning behind your words.
86,"I think you have to do thing called READING. It's practice that's been around for thousands of years, but if your not into that there's another thing called: PATIENCE."

89,"She's quite possibly as useful or more useful than Taiju, but let's not pretend she's nearly as useful as Senku"
90,"But that's the point of division of labour. Even if Senku is objectively better in every single aspect, Yuzuhira and Taiju's existence is still massively beneficial to Senku and would accelerate his goal much faster.

Think about how much slower Senku would have been to developing the serum if Taiju didn't basically take over 99.9% of all the daily maintenance activities to free him up to research. Yuzuhira being above average useful is absolutely huge."
91,"I absolutely don't mean to say that Taiju and Yuzuriha are useless. They're clearly not, and I agree that Senku would struggle without their assistance. 


Nonetheless, Senku is more useful. He is the key existence in rebuilding society, and ultimately the others can only play a strong supporting role."
92,"I get what you’re saying. But Senku isn’t better in every area. He’s maybe a normal human in everything but intelligence but when you have super humans like Tsukasa and Taiju around that means his strength and stamina are immediate weaknesses. 

We still haven’t seen Yuzuhira shine yet, but last episode and this episode make me hopeful she will too. If that happens then he might even be below average in strength."

98,"It's good to know.  I don't WANT to think that she is a dumb bimbo, and this episode proves that she ISN'T...I just can't get over how dumb-moe she looks (Which is a critique on her art style, as opposed to her as a character)"
99,"From my recollection, the female characters are actually useful or at least equally so to the male ones. 

They're just drawn, uh, strangely."
100,"It's Boichi's weakness, unfortunately, that even the anime couldn't fix; he can't draw women that don't look like sex dolls."
101,"Can you blame the man, He used to write doujins"
102,Yeah? I don't find awkward anatomy sexy. Like obviously there's a suspension of disbelief when dealing with drawn anatomy but his breaks it for me
103,If he just drew some men and added some boobs and called them woman I would be less annoyed by their art style.
104,"I don't read the Manga, so that is a relief to know, I hate when animes have these characters. Thanks for the no-spoiler information :)"

107,"As a manga reader, can you just shut up. There's literally no reason to make this comment other than to spoil things."
108,I told you guys he was actually dead.
109,"Men can you imagine that actually happening.

More balls than every other manga this days combined."
110,"It'd be an interesting alternative story, focusing on the universality of the scientific method rather than the hypergenius walking wikipedia's collection of knowledge. It'd need to have set it up though, like some conversation along the lines of ""wow senku you're so cool"" - ""no no my meatheaded friend, you too can learn this through Experiments And Shit."" And then he has to and it's very character growth. It'd be a wildly different tone for the story, though."
111,"I remember some quote somewhere about how science advances in two ways: one way is through massive leaps of progress spearheaded by one or two visionaries (e.g. Einstein), while the other is through slow and methodical trial and error. While the first way is more glamorous, both are equally important."
112,"The notion of the ""paradigm shift"" was first widely popularised by Kuhn, but the quote you're very likely thinking of is from one of my all-time favourite video games, Alpha Centauri:

>There are two kinds of scientific progress: the methodical experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius which redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging our debt to the former, we yearn, nonetheless, for the latter.

>-Academician Prokhor Zakharov, ""Address to the Faculty"""
113,[deleted]
114,"Or an inevitable result as the slow process starts to grow ever slower towards a limit, people are driven to start questioning the system more and searching for something to break through the limit.

It's not like we have just regular scientists and then superstar scientists who magically make leaps and bounds in progress. A super genius person can spend their life doing fairly normal science because they're born in a time where we don't have enough information for a breakthrough. Whilst a fairly 'normal' scientist can become a superstar given the right circumstances."
115,"Senku does have absurd anime intelligence with an encyclopedic knowledge, but it's not like he also doesn't use trial and error. He explains to Taiju in episode 1 that science is a long and tedious process and in this episode we watched him make several attempts on stuff like making fire, making spearheads, hunting, etc. I liked how it showed Senku trying over and over instead of finding the answer right away"
116,"It's one thing to have knowledge, it's a totally different thing to be able to apply that knowledge."
117,I have read on how primitive man had to be as smart as us with all the different types of knowledge of how to do stuff they had to deal with. Article then broke down examples like seen here what rocks work best. And how complex tracking something is.
118,"I mean yeah, it's a pretty big misconception to believe that primitive humans were dumber than us. We're almost literally the exact same organisms as humans tens of thousands of years ago, and we're likely dumber than neanderthals. 

Humanity has just done a good job of maintaining, teaching and growing its wealth of knowledge so that each generation can stand on the shoulders of the last."
119,I honestly loved that. The manga/anime could've easily let him be an all powerful genius but as shown he's still quite limited. Keeps the story very grounded in reality because I can easily believe someone as hardworking as Senku can be very knowledgeable since we're shown he's been very hardworking since young.
120,Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality
121,"Well, I have been known to say that it would have been much better if Harry died."
122,"[Light manga spoiler I guess](/s ""I think that's basically what he teaches to the Village's ""crazy"" kid, how it's not magic but actually science and he becomes his apprentice. But yeah, Senku Deus Ex Machina happens most of the time."")"
123,You do have to remember being ballsy != good writing. Killing off the far and away most interesting character is a great way to disinterest so many people.
124,Because fake killing them off is better?
125,"Ehh taking into account the general comments i can't think of Senku as the most interesting character.

I like him but he is definitely not my favourite and some people even dislike him.

Besides isnt the main appeal of GOT the fact that aside from 3 guys everyone dies?"
126,"GoT doesn't actually kill essential characters, it just doesn't make it clear in the beginning which characters are essential. As early as book 2 it's clear that certain characters are covered in plot armor just like in any other story."
127,">GoT doesn't actually kill essential characters, it just doesn't make it clear in the beginning which characters are essential.

Really good comment and it's a highlight of Martin's writing. He's very good at using conventional expectations of 'importance' against the reader. But with hindsight, the deaths are almost always reasonable."
128,"Game of Thrones writing went to shit, it used to make sense why people died and it related to character arcs, towards the end of the show they ditched all that and it became dumb.  The writers apparently wrapped it up in 8 episodes when they could have done 3 full length seasons so they can work on Star Wars, but it was already going downhill by the 7th season."
129,"I used the word ""appeal"" instead of good writting.

The guy i replied to was arguing about the fact that killing a MC would be unatractive and unpopular. I tried to argue with something that it has MASSIVE MASS APPEAL and its popular as hell, i didnt said it had/has/will have good writting."
130,"There was others below your comment I was probably more responding to. It had mass appeal in game of thrones because there was good writing behind it, when the good writing went away and the shocking mc deaths stopped having a reason it became shit and everyone stopped liking it."
131,"You failed to take into account that the others were referencing the books, not the show."
132,I just wanted to comment and didnt care where or to who/what so I did it
133,Ditto.
134,Yeah GOT is shit writing.
135,Well i thought it might have SOMETHING since its the most popular thing i ever heard of. Almost 20% of the Internet was GOT related a couple of weeks ago.
136,Because it has popular appeal of “oh it’s so violent and people die that’s so edgy.” George Zimmerman got lucky his books got the attention of people who hate women and critical thinking.
137,You know plenty of women also love GoT.
138,I’m really not interested in who loves shitty writing. You can be a woman and still not be able to tell good writing from bad. You can also be a woman who hates other women. Liking George Zimmerman’s hack writing is not a personality trait sweaty.
139,"> sweaty

Hey! I showered this morning!"
140,"> George Zimmerman got lucky his books got the attention of people who hate women and critical thinking

What?

Are you trolling? Or seriously just this incoherently dumb?"
141,Buddy I don’t even know what point you’re trying to make. If you can’t understand what I said or even form a coherent question on why a retarded old man’s books sell so well to other retard uncles please move along or read a book or something. Maybe try taking some basic reading comprehension courses.
142,"In the manga, the character polls put senku at 1st, while taiju and yuzuriha are like 8th and 9th"
143,">I like him but he is definitely not my favourite and some people even dislike him.

Who is?

Mr puppy dog? Love interest-chan? Edgy hercules?

>Besides isnt the main appeal of GOT the fact that aside from 3 guys everyone dies?

Game of thrones has always had a split story showing the perspective of many different characters as protagonists of their own story.

And sure, the risk of death is interesting, but if they kill off all the actually interesting characters, people wont want to watch anymore.

Really, the show just killed off characters at the start to make you feel like there's a threat of people dying, when really, the main protagonists manage to stay alive through a lot of bullshit."
144,Subverting expectations? Hmm

148,"no, it's 12 years old"
149,"You can't kill the main character early on, because then he is not the main character.
It's not balls, it would make no sense."
150,"The beginning did make me feel a little bad for Tsukasa, especially the part with Yuzuriha's dolls. Really nice we see Senkus first days in the stone world.

The urge to read the manga is getting stronger and stronger each week."
151,"[Speaking of the beginning, who was this girl?](https://i.imgur.com/rIp8kaZ.png) They put her right in the front like she would be a main character, but we never saw her before or after. Interesting bit."
152,Remember Tsukasa backstory? That girl has a seashells around her neck and is looking at Tsukasa. She is probably his sister.
153,"I missed last week's episode and watched before this one. I distinctly remember saying that he had admirers, but no one that he thought of as ""precious"" to him.

Dick move, Tsukasa."
154,"He did love his sister, but in episode 2 I think it's implied she died when he was young, as he said she was undergoing surgery and that in the end she was never able to be the little mermaid.

In last week's episode when he talks about only having admirers but no one precious to him we see him close to his current age and in a ring, so he was most likely talking about not having a close relationship with anyone his age."
155,Doesn't even have to be anyone his age; if his sister is dead and she was the only one he cared about she doesn't really count right? He currently has nobody he is close to who is alive.
156,oh and that evil guy he broke statue of was the guy that beat him up when he was a kid looking for shells ?
157,Is that also the stone girl he put seashells around the neck? Because that would mean he killed his own parents.
158,[removed]
159,That's literally all information we've already been presented with in the anime and then a very obvious theory.

161,We've literally already seen the character lmao
162,Pretty obvious that's it's his sister with the shell necklace and all.
163,Take a closer look to what she has around her neck and start connecting the dots to info Tsukasa already gave us.
164,Not sure but I'm goin to assume the blonde girl that was doing the signal fires ?
165,"His motivation for murdering the adult population is that he was beat up by a middle-aged man for ""stealing"" shells to make a necklace for his sister, so it's safe to say that it's supposed to be her and he wouldn't have developed his crazy ideology."
166,Well that and seeing what the Adults were doing wrong more than what they were doing right and being unaware from lack of historical knowledge that having the Warlords be young only makes it worse. He missing the scientific knowledge that humans are naturally tribal and territorial and thus war will come without  old people involved. Chimpanzees wage wars on each other it not just a human instinct.
167,"That's what I've assumed as well, the blonde hair is too much of a coincidence."
168,"Seems Tsukasa has knows that blonde girl, seeing how she appeared in his 'what if'."
169,"Very unlikely, it's probably his sister lol...look at her necklace."
170,"she kind of looks like the girl setting off the smoke signals, also ik im late but i just watched episode 5. Reason I say it might be her is because they both had blonde hair. Just an assumption. Also like other comments say, it could be his sister. So was his sister the one to set off the signals?"
171,">The beginning did make me feel a little bad for Tsukasa

This bit made me tear up! I was such a tragic moment."
172,yeah those beginning shots showing the life that could have been were a really nice touch that I wasn't expecting to work as well as it did.
173,There was even the Avenger dusting scene
174,I gave up and started reading it last night and it rocks. You won't be disappointed when you get into it. I'm gonna finish reading all the chapters today!
175,Every episode makes me want to pick up the manga man. It's so rough.
176,"I read the whole thing, it's worth it"
177,I say Tsukasa isn't wrong. Adults are all corrupt and bad for the new stone world.
178,Fuck the OST is so good in this adaptation.
179,Yeah the OST has been great so far. Feel the songs played have really encapsulated the manga
180,"You can say anything about the course of the story but you cant deny that the OST its incredible.

It's probably amongst the 2 or 3 anime OST i can actually remember."
181,"Honestly, that beginning segment with the alternate storyline of Tsukasa being friends with Senku really stuck with me. I feel rather sad that we didn't get to keep that friendliness from right after Tsukasa was revived."
182,"Shows how little it takes for someone's life to go the wrong way. It's a little, but amazing segment."
183,"If Tsukasa was a friend they'd have a well-balanced RPG party; a DPS, a tanker, a wizard, and a... uh maybe you can treat Yuzuriha as a healer"
184,A stress healer.
185,"Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow, and insidious killer."
186,"Driving out corruption is an endless battle, but one that must be fought."
187,"And now the darkness holds dominion, black as death."

189,COMPASSION IS A RARITY IN THE FEVER PITCH OF BATTLE .
190,gachiBASS
191,"People in the reply chain are really underestimating Yuzuhira. While trying to start a fire with his barehands, Senku commented that Yuzuhira would have been able to do it because she's very dexterous. We also know that she's pretty good at hand crafting and she appears to be above average intelligence.

She's a much greater asset than we give credit for."
192,"She's the trickster, advanced class combining Rogue and Cleric :p"
193,A cleric. She's definitely the cleric.
194,"> a wizard

Making senku, who viewed depetrifying people as science vs magic, into the wizard"
195,Alchemist sounds more like his role
196,"wizards are well studied and intelligent class. If magic had rules and properties, then wizards would be mathematicians and physicists."
197,"Wizards aren't superheroes though, they don't have powers that ""just work"" they studied relentlessly. In fantasy, wizards are generally people from privileged backgrounds who could spend their time studying and learning instead of working fields or mining. It's a pretty strong analogue for scientists before the modern era.

Seeing the signal fires should indicate to him that some humans didn't get petrified, which means after 5000 years there will now be plenty of old corrupt people already lording over the world as before, so his plan to stop them from reviving so that the world can remain pure is already a total wash. 

Plus, some could reasonably still have guns, a team of them are probably physically fit enough to subdue him, having been raised in an environment with lions roaming about."
204,"I'm not entirely sure that guns would still function reliably after 3700 years. Some guns can be pretty finicky, even with proper maintenance.  
To say nothing about lacking a reliable source of ammunition."
205,"Yeah but there's also be libraries dotting the landscape, which someone would have attempted to extract useful information to transcribe for future generations. The extreme scale of the loss of civilization implies to me that the last remnants of humanity went through total moral breakdown at the trauma of the event, indulging in immediate pleasures and forsaking future generations because the world as they know it is over."
206,"Admittedly, we don't definitively know that every single last human was petrified that day, and there could have been a small handful of people left behind afterwards, but I still think you're underestimating just how fragile most things are with respect to aging and how much maintenance has to be put in to keeping them from falling apart over such a long time span."
207,"Well it's not like Senku is really providing truly pivotal intellectual insight that only he could provide, he's basically a walking encyclopedia. Which means anyone should be able to just get a wilderness survival guide from the library and recreate everything he's got so far within year one of the apocalypse. Plus they'd have free food and gasoline for at least a month.

It could make sense if the remnants started to fight each other for scraps on year 5, maybe. Or maybe the surviving population is so small and monocultural that the negative effects of inbreeding cause generations 3 thru 10 to suffer from severe deformaties affecting their intelligence."
208,"Ammo is the problem. Most guns are just hunks of reciprocating metal. Kept  out of the elements most should function fine. Especially if they never had corrosive ammo fired in them.

254,"It's the nitric acid in the cave. The say in order to revive someone, they need the miracle water mix, but that's only to revive someone instantly. Senku was under the spot it dropped when he woke up. He also dragged Taiju to the same spot, where it took like a week for him to wake up. They don't give exact details, they just know if you want to put it in a jar, you need to add some other things."

But after manga I thought that Tsukasa hit the stone part, which protected Senku's neck from breaking, so I thought it was kinda too lucky.

271,"Definitely a next level decision. He really is sure of himself, for good reason apparently"

He knew senku couldnt retaliate, he had yuzuriha as a hostage and her death would cause taiju to go berserk leading to tsukasa killing him as well. It's a complete and total checkmate. The only outlier is tsukasa doesnt know about the regenerative properties of the miracle fluid or that senku was still slightly petrified."
281,"It's one of those times where you can give a character credit for the self-sacrifice even if they had a plan, because that plan was far from a guaranteed success. The stone healing his neck enough to revive him wasn't sure to happen, and even if it did the other two would need to be able to get him to a safe location, remember what he said about de-petrification healing wounds, and de-petrify his neck before his brain was too far gone to be revived by just fixing his neck."

I still dont really understand the point though? Wasn't he gonna let them go free with senku's corpse anyway? He was only gonna fight them if they fought him, so what was the point?

>[For a man of science he's pretty ripped.](https://i.imgur.com/xv3kRVO.png) How is he ripped like that but still has the stamina of someone who doesn't workout?

287,"It was not only you, many had that impression. The only way to truly be sure was if you read the promotional material that came out a couple of months before the series started, most of it in Japanese, it made clear that Senku was the main character and Taiju his sidekick. I think Viz also ran a couple of small pieces on it in English. I remember being confused when I started reading and seeing how much focus Taiju was getting."
288,The cover of the manga kinda gave away Senku being the main character for me.
289,QFT. This is an aspect that is really not apparent from the anime.
290,"I thought that too. 

I liked Dr Stone in its first few chapters, but I didn't *love* it. The chapter this episode covered though, showing Senku waking up in the new stone world, changed that, and the focus shifted from Taiju to Senku. It was in many ways a reboot of the series for us readers. 

I actually think that was a good choice. I love characters like Senku – powerful, intelligent, motivated, revolutionary characters, but they are almost always more interesting being watched from the perspective of another. As main characters they are hard to write, and their brilliance may come off as more pretentious and OP, because few can relate to someone like that. But if you can look at them from the viewpoint of a more normal person like Taiju you can appreciate just how special this character is. 

If Senku had been the protagonist, the character whose eyes we see through, from the start it could've been annoying. There'd be no mystery and little tension. But instead we get a more slow delve into the mind of this miraculous man and the miraculous world we've found ourselves in."
291,"I read somewhere that taiju was supposed to be the mc but then the mangaka decided to go with senku because the story would be more interesting, if I recall correctly."
292,"That's not true. The author talked about his inspirations in a few interviews, one example here: (beware, a bit after mention of Eyeshield 21 there is a spoiler from manga with one page being displayed) https://www.otaquest.com/riichiro-inagaki-interview-dr-stone-inspiration/

Most important fragment for people that are very wary of accidental spoilers: 
> Thinking about the world in general, Inagaki also reckoned that there was no real need to make something up when there’s already plenty of people who are pretty cool in their own way, yet don’t get much of the limelight – such as scientists and researchers. Thus, the foundational idea for Dr. STONE’s protagonist Senku was born."
293,"I actually started with the anime, then binged the manga, and I still thought Taiju was the MC."
294,"> the studio would have had to make a different op and ed only for say 4 episodes and all the promotional images wouldn't advertise the true nature of the story)

That has been done before to spectacular effect. It's not THAT hard to make a spare set of opening sections, closing sections, etc. I'm not sure they could've pulled it off though.

The fact that they hard-themed the series on science made Senku pretty attractive as the protagonist. He's at least the most powerful person in the world, assuming you buy into his ""genius"", by far. But the fact that his actions drove the plot hard-core from day 1 are pretty telling.

Although I think the story sort of jumped the shark this episode. It would've been far more interesting if they had actually murdered Senku last episode. They set up this whole show on the rebuilding of technology, and WHAM, assassinate the mastermind behind that future. Instead, society has to go a different route. Some of them try to pick up on Senku's dream, others try to enforce a hard reset, and we end up with a very low-tech story. That would be fantastic.

Even better would be if they slowed down the start section of the series in order to go into more detail on what Senku's dream was, what he gave in terms of technology so far, and THEN killed him.

This show could've been SOOO GOOOOD. Oh well. Considering dropping it right here. I don't really enjoy watching lazy writers make a mockery of something so beautiful as science."

296,"He creeps me out, he seems to get the funky face each time Senku makes something new."
297,he's the normal guy who's also very dramatic.
298,Guess Plushy Tsukasa did not survive the snap.
299,"I don't feel so good, Mrs. Yuzuriha."
300,"Great episode, also did I just heard a Pokeball sound effect during when Senku was trying to make fire?"
301,"They tried to make us believe he did the fire with those skinny arms and some ""science"" (pfff), but we all know it's much easier if he just used one of those Chimchar that were around. That's why he built the spears and knives first, to catch 'em all!"
302,I think this was probably the best episode so far. A really emotional first half and then a great second half getting down to science shenanigans with a solo Senku. It was good to see how he got to the point Taiju met him at.
303,Don't worry. We're barely getting started and it'll get very exciting!

&#x200B;

So that means we're supposed to believe that the stone revival fluid did not only repair the severed nerve, but also reversed brain death."
335,"Taking into account the flashbacks and ""look mom I can think really fast"" moments, I'd say that there's a bit more than 6 minutes between Senku's death and revival. The Wikipedia article for clinical death gives 3 minutes for a full recovery (ie. without brain damage), but also later mentions that cooling down the body can increase the window up to 10 minutes. Considering the fact that it starts raining fairly quickly in this episode, I think that even without the petrification's miraculous recovery abilities (of which the limitations aren't explained, and it *does* allow a person to survive for thousands of years without food or water, after all), it might not be impossible for Senku to have survived this."
336,"Taiju also did chest compressions, which would have kept the blood flowing to his brain and lengthened that window."
337,Oh wow that sounds like a reasonable explanation! Thanks for your research
338,i meeennn a guy killed a lion with his hands soooo
339,"Yea so other guys response isn't really true and I think you're right. The show has had so many loop holes and the one today was really annoying for me as a medical student.

His cervical nerves were lesioned. It took about probably more than 5 minutes to get that fluid on his back and 'cure' him. Based on this his sympathetic tracts would be shut off because the lesion was up in like the C4/C5 region so he would have loss of Sympathetics/parasympathetics to his heart which means his Heart would lose contractile function. That in turn would cause a myocardial infarction (Heart attack) once his myocytes ran out of ATP which is literally in as fast as a 1 minute without oxygenation/energy.

Not to mention that the fact his Central nervous system would be lesioned severely that would go on to affect his respiratory centers and he would not be breathing which I'm pretty sure they said that he wasn't breathing. Neurons are one of if not the fastest cells in the human body to be affected my ischemia (loss of oxygenation) and they can only survive up to like 2 minutes of ischemia so his neurons would start dying off. He would have massive brain damage and he would practically be braindead.

Also the thought of hypothermic cooling other guy brought up isnt really true. The part where it delays neuron death and whatnot is true. But for this process we are literally talking about cooling the body downwards of like 7-8 degrees celsius! Thats a huge amount. Rain just simply cant do this haha."
340,"Then again, this all relies on magical healing petrification that is undone by an ethanol+nitric acid solution, so yeah, *this* aspect of the story is remarkably non-scientific anyway."

They could have ended last episode with Senku getting kicked off the cliff and then landing safely(because he calculating the angle or something) that would have been better than this.
342,"Mmm if you just decide to have a little suspension of disbelief, this was definitely way more of an interesting ""did he actually die"" twist. not that many of us probably really believed he was dead anyway, the scenario you described isn't very interesting to me personally"
343,Dude if you are expecting this show to not have loop holes you are not going to enjoy it. It needs some suspension of disbelief.
344,"The dude is dead

His body is already cooling off by itself and you completely forgot to mention that the chest compressions are doing the heart's job of keeping the body ""ready"". What's the point of this comment?"
345,"Point of the comment is to bring in an actual medical point of view and show the stupidity of the situation and how no matter what the character technically should not be functional following the events that happened.

Even if he did do chest compressions he started doing compressions after at least 5 minutes. That wouldn't magically solve the issues that happened. That's not how our body works. And I was explaining to the comment above the actual medical reasoning."
346,still more realistic than \[all\] of the current WSJ features haha.
347,I heard the heart beats on its own though? There was something bout brain death and heart not being part of it. But what you're saying makes sense.

372,"Tsukaka is a bad person and a murderer but the part where he was inserted into the flashback made me feel bad for him. Wish he could just get along with the others but again, he’s a awful person and he tried to kill the main protagonist. Guess kars fails again 

.I’m guessing that the blond girl with the seashells around her neck in the flashback might be the other survivor. I think I saw a blond girl in the op. 

Really enjoying this show and think this is my favourite ep so far"
373,it's crazy how i saw 2 important characters in the flash back. The hinting and foreshadowing is great. but all will be explained... until the last episode lol
374,He explained who the blonde girl in the flashback is when he was first introduced.
375,Blonde girls with seashells is likely Tsukasa’s little sister who never got to be the Little Mermaid.
376,"Wow, the scene with Taiju crying over Senku in the rain made me tear up, the music made it so much more powerful. As a manga reader I really didn't think it would have that effect on me.

Seeing Senku right after he wakes up with the monkeys was so awesome.

[Spoiler](/s ""I was also really really hoping to finally see Kohaku this episode but I guess they're going to make us wait another week for her."")"
377,You might want to spoiler tag that last sentence.
378,"For such a ""simpleton"", that was some good thinking by Taiju."
379,I do enjoy how alot of his character really is just how much faith he puts in senku and how even if he doesn't understand he knows senku.
380,Shiny monkey plays minecraft
381,Man this show is so fun. I watched the first 5 eps today and was entertained throughout.
382,I wished senku and bucciarati really did become friends before the petrification happened. Then there'd be 4 of em together!
383,I fucking thought that was Bucciarati's voice. Thank god Tsukasa didn't use his stand to kill Senku. That would've been overkill.
384,It is indeed bucciarati's voice! Same seiyuu :D
385,He does a great job.
386,Next episode gonna be good
387,Crazy how even though Dr stone has this anime airing the manga sales are still low. Losing to spyxfamily so hard too
388,"Dr. Stone manga sales aren't low, and it's actually currently selling more than Spy x Family.

It ranked [10](https://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/obc/w/2019-07-15/) in volume 11's first week sales, compared to Spy x Family's volume 1 [sales (18)](https://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/obc/w/2019-07-15/p/2/).

The only thing here is that Dr. Stone sales haven't particularly gone up. First week sales for Dr. Stone have consistently stayed around the 40k-60k mark, which is not bad, or great, but decent."
389,">Dr. Stone manga sales aren't low, and it's actually currently selling more than Spy x Family.

No it doesn't.

Dr Stone v11 sold 92,654 copies before dissapearing from Oricon, it couldn't cross the 100k mark in one month once again. Meanwhile Spy x Family already cross it (104,136 copies sold) within the same time frame as Stone.

Now that HinoZumou ended, Stone is the third series in Jump with less sales without counting the newbies. Only Yuuna and Chainsaw Man sales are lower but Chainsaw is having a growth in sales so in a short time it will surpass Stone."
390,"Are you able to see Oricon's full rankings? I can only see 1-30. In Dr. Stone's 1st and 2nd weeks it sold a total of 81,274 (from what I can see.) In Spy x Family's 1st and 4th weeks (again, from what I can see it is in the top 30 in it's first, disappears, and then reappears in it's 4th,) it sold a total of 79,644.

I may be wrong based on full rankings but it still appears that Dr. Stone sold more than Spy x Family in the 4 weeks."
391,"You have to pay to see the full rankings. And those 81k are from its 2nd week, down its the 3rd week and then it dissapeared from the rankings.

>Weekly Oricon (15/07/19 - 21/07/19)

>*11380 **92654  Stone 11

>**9949 **63953  SxF 1

This are from this week.

>Weekly Oricon (22/07/19 - 28/07/19)

>40183 *104136  SxF 1

Since the first print of v1 of Spy x Family was announced been around 50k, the first weeks were slow because of such high demand, now that the reprints are already in stores the series is selling more and more as you see in this week sales."
392,"That makes sense. Dr. Stone volume 12 may break 100k because of the anime. It has just started after all.

Do you know a better way to see the sales?"
393,"It may sound like a joke but in 4chan they sometimes post them in the ToC Jump thread or they made one for the sales between Tuesday/Wednesday, but obviously they use it to make fun of various series from the magazine. 

There's also a forum dedicated for Jump magazine that they post them and some charts of thus said sales. It is in MangaHelpers.

Thats how I do it and just compiled the sales week in a document because, afterall, Oricon is behind a paywall."
394,Thank you
395,"Chainsawman vol.3 was released today, and with these last chapters, i can see receiving a good growth on tankoubon sales."
396,Thank you for the actual numbers!
397,Spy x Family is fantastic.
398,"> Spy x Family is fantastic.

Not just fantastic, some would say it is quite [*élégant*](https://i.imgur.com/XyHtAGl.png)"
399,"It's not just that it's good. It's that SxF is doing better than Dr Stone after only a couple of months in publication and without an anime adaptation and a massive marketing effort to sell it.

They went so far as to rent a billboard on the Times Square the promote the anime but it's still being effortlessly outdone by a newcoming manga."
400,"I'm enjoying Dr. Stone, but I don't see how Crunchyroll expected it to be the biggest anime ever and that everyone is promoting it as this new front runner. It's got super tacky comedy that people watching the anime aren't too into, and it's got a really slow and odd start. It just doesn't have the makings of a huge huge show deserving of a times square ad."
401,"It started out really interesting but the main antagonist, although surprisingly well done, took the story in a direction I didn't find interesting. It just felt tacked on because we can't have a shonen without an antagonist."
402,"Yeah, I think the environment being out to kill them would have been a lot more interesting. Have animals that have evolved to be stronger because of the tiny amount of edible animals left in the world, that would have been cool I think."
403,"I mean, the second they got basic spears every animal on the world were fucked. It's not really an interesting plot unless you go full Jurassic Park, which would go against the main theme of the series."
404,"From watching other survival-type tv shows there are plenty of things that are challenging about living in the wilderness with no supplies, but it's not really sexy enough to go into a shounen manga. For an anime example, I'm also watching 'Sounan Desu Ka?' this season which makes a point to show how much work it is just to do things like regulate your body temperature, not starve, and keep morale high, especially with no previous survival experience.

The main reason it's impossible NOT to have an antagonist in this show is that Senku is a godly hyper-genius with encyclopedic knowledge of everything and no real weaknesses. I think that if he was just an extremely smart but believably human guy, there could be a great show about developing as a civilization and all the progress it takes to get where we are today (although they'd probably have to publish it somewhere else).

This is still among my top shows this season because I'm into the drama anyway, but I can't watch without imagining the alternate reality version that I would have liked better."
405,"> From watching other survival-type tv shows there are plenty of things that are challenging about living in the wilderness with no supplies, but it's not really sexy enough to go into a shounen manga.

Depends on your perspective of sexy. As a young child, my favorite show was Survivorman. Not Man vs Wild, which felt cheap and stupid. But in survivorman, the protagonist was truly alone AND had to survive for one week. All the shit he had to go through was super interesting. And the trick is, in survivorman the dude is just trying to survive for one week, then he goes home. If you're trying to discover the secret to being turned into stone, or if you're trying to rebuild society, there is so much more to get into.

As it is, this show has bored me to death with a complete mockery of science and survival.

Out of curiosity, I'll give you one question, to see if you know more about survival than an anime that supposedly tackled survival in this episode.

You wake up somewhere in the wilderness. You know that nobody is coming for you. You take a deep breath and examine yourself. Your body is not in any pain. You look around you and don't see something shockingly urgent about to murder you. What is your number one concern. **What is the first thing you must do?**

[This should be your answer.](/s ""Water. You need access to fresh, drinkable water. If you woke up naked and its super cold outside, getting something to keep you warm might be more important, but water is still up there. There's a saying... 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food."") If you got the answer right, congratulations. If you got the answer wrong, you shouldn't feel bad. You should research actual survival and how you might survive if you were on a hiking trip and something bad happened, like you got lost. [And spoilers for the answer above.](/s ""If you try and replicate the anime, you'll likely die even though you probably could've survived by doing nothing and staying put... assuming someone knows where you are. Now's a good time to remind people... tell someone where you're going before you leave. If you know help is on the way, you can basically stay put."")"
406,"I was actually thinking mostly of the shows Alone, and Naked And Afraid, which were the closest tv analogues to the Dr. Stone situation that I can think of. Especially Alone, since the people are out there by themselves (duh) for an indefinite amount of time.

Honestly I kinda forgot kids could be interested in the more mundane parts of a survival show. I was in high school when Survivorman and Man vs Wild were competing and never really watched either of them. Not sure what other kinds of manga Weekly Shonen Jump normally runs, but you're right that a more legit survival story could have a chance with the demographic after all.

I'm not sure what the quiz is for but to its credit, Sounan Desu Ka also mentions the rule of 3 to emphasize the missing part of the saying, 3 hours without shelter. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because that show is way too comfy to feel like an actual survival situation, and there are times they give bad info to make for better television (it's probably like the Bear Grylls of anime), but it's more plausible than Dr. Stone at least.

I have my fill of strictly survival focused shows on US television, so the way I think I would have liked Dr. Stone to go is for the show to mainly be about building a civilization, like re-developing agriculture and government and things. It wouldn't need to be 100% realistic, for example I'd be cool with pretty big leaps in technology within the main characters' lifetimes. All the manga readers are talking about how there are huge changes coming next episode, so I'm hoping the show starts to focus more on rebuilding society and less on Senku vs. Tsukasa once they meet the new characters."
407,"Shelter? Not... really... Like the saying goes, 3 hours without shelter **in a harsh environment**... which isn't the point of the question. Now, had Senku woken up in a snowy winter, then Shelter would be pretty important. If it was super hot, and especially humid (IE Japan, at least from what I hear), then water is even more important. Dehydration will kill faster than 3 days if you're moving around.

The whole point of shelter is to protect against exposure to the elements... specifically temperature and water. If it is too cold, you'll need more clothes. If it is too warm, you'll need water. If you are wet, you'll need fire.

The fact that Senku's primary focus is on building a fire seems very much misplaced, as opposed to finding a source of potable water. But beyond that, water is never really mentioned. He instead starts hunting food, and crafting clothing. Too much bullshit for my tastes.

I never really got into Alone or Naked and Afraid. Naked and Afraid seemed like too much of a drama. I don't care about watching two adults bicker like children in the middle of a survival situation. In a survival situation, you need to stay positive, and cooperate, unless you like the prospect of dying. You can bicker and argue afterwards, if you so wish, but while you're in the survival situation no in-fighting.

BUT, that doesn't make for good TV, so we get the shit we get.

Edit... in other news, I just finished catching up on Sounan Desu Ka, and it is pretty awesome at doing survival. Much better than Dr Stone. Granted, the girls are a little too thirsty for my tastes. I mean, DAMN I've seen porn-stars less thirsty than some of these girls."
408,Seeing Senku find a way to take lions could've been cool
409,I think gunpowder does the trick.
410,Now how do you get a cannon or a gun? There's more to explore.
411,">Using cannons against a lion

Are you the guy that was permanently banned from every safari in the world?"
412,"How do you plan to use the gunpowder? The point is, if you want any sense of accuracy you're gonna need to forge some metal."
413,"Pit Traps work good. Snare traps also good. Get them to go over a cliff running from a grass fire. Get them to go over Clift or into pit trap chasing someone. Go for the young when most of the Pride is far away. Primitive poison, Lots of the cheese tactics used in Goblin Slayer. 
Primitive Man had to deal with Saber Tooth Tigers, the larger than anything current Cave Bear, the Wargs of Game of Thrones were a real thing, supper Elephants called Mammoths. And they all went away while we kept going on only having stone weapons. Stone weapons which certainly not the primary way we won. The Stone weapons more a deterrent you attack us we leave you cut which might get infected and kill. Often the reason is humans don't fight anywhere near to fair. Humans in gaming terms are the masters of cheese. On Reason predators leave humans alone is humans take revenge if they kill one human, Humans kill every member of that spices anywhere near."
414,"Without saying too much, I had the same concerns. I think you might be surprised by where the story goes but all I'll say is that this is somewhat of a slow build up to the real story."
415,Glad to hear!
416,To be fair Spy x Family is pretty amazing and deserve the sales that they're getting. Wouldn't be surprised if that will be the next Shounen Jump title to get an anime. I'm guessing Spy x Family just appeals to a wider audience compared to Dr. Stone.
417,"I suggest we wait till volume 12. It's true that the sales are not that good, but volume 11 (after 2 episodes) sold like 12k more than volume 10. Even series like Fire Force or even VINLAND do not sell that much either. Dr.Stone's anime is one of the most popular this season PLUS they are pushing it hard. It may have a huge boost like Kimetsu or it might not. Volume 12 (sept 4) will decide the fate of the series."
418,Plus Jujutsu Kaisen and Act-Age .
419,"SxF and Jujutsu Kaisen are very good, doesn't surprise me at all..."
420,Does JJK get better? 6 chapters in a it just feels like Bleach meets Naruto with average art...
421,"yes, it does"
422,"As much as I love the manga, the premise for Spyxfamily is so good and the characters are so fun, that I do love it a bit more then Stone."
423,well spyxfamily is actually good
424,Dr Stone is doing badly even after being pushed so hard by the publisher. It's a shame. It would do better in a different magazine
425,It's doing well in the WSJ rankings: https://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-809337/weekly-shonen-jump-rankings?pg=216 and [has been doing so for a while.](https://weeklyjump.livejournal.com/) Also Dr. Stone is in Weekly Shonen Jump while Spy x Family is in Shonen Jump+ which are different magazines of the same company. I like both series but they're too different to be compared with each other.
426,"The WSJ rankings are a place to promote low selling series, they're controlled by editors so series that sell less can have a place to say 'hey look I'm up here it must be good buy me'"
427,One Piece consistently tops the rankings whenever it appears and is the top selling manga of all time though.
428,"As I said, it's controlled by editors. Right now they want to promote Wano as much as they can so It doesn't lose traction. OP is the most sold manga by month by a wide margin still but they're going down slowly. You can also look at the anime, they noticed they needed a boost to keep up with the quality coming up in these times"
429,"It could be used like that, and yet they do reflect the quality of each series very accurately."
430,"How would it do better in another magazine that doesn't have the marketing power of Shonen Jump? It would do even worse. You're talking like it got cancelled prematurely in the meat grinder like most new series, but despite it's poor sales 11 volumes in, Jump is still having hopes for it and keps pushing it like crazy. The only reason this anime even exists is because it's a Jump manga."
431,"Yeah, what was with the uncalled for SxF shade? It's good shit, and I personally enjoy it more than Dr. Stone."
432,"> the uncalled for SxF shade?

Because unlike SxF, Dr Stone is, at this point, practically a staple of WSJ having been published for two years now(SxF only started 4 months ago) on top of getting some massive marketing push.

Not only is Dr Stone getting an anime adaptation right now, but the marketing for it went so far as to buy [ad space on the Times Square](https://twitter.com/__psw/status/1145929556848590848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1145930354093518848&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2Fanime%2F2019%2F07%2F03%2Fdr-stone-anime-times-square-ad-creator-responds%2F), being, afaik, only the second anime to ever do so."
433,"All I'm getting from this is people prefer a better manga, despite the lesser manga doing everything possible to get sales.

Sometimes quality speaks for itself and wins out, despite the marketing push."
434,Act-Age is an acting manga that just started a year ago and sells more than dr stone . Plus SxF is mostly a slice of life comedy series with some action . I like dr stone but it’s getting weird how low the sales are compared to newer titles .
435,"I mean isn't the easy answer simply it not being appealing? There just doesn't seem to be any internal logical consistency to anything. I gave up the manga after awhile because it was just getting stupid.

I guess having a delinquent character knocking out a lion should've been an indicator.

Excellent premise, kinda dumb execution."
436,">I guess having a delinquent character knocking out a lion should've been an indicator.

Exact turning point for me."
437,... yet you two are still here?
438,I can like something but not be oblivious to it’s flaws .
439,Liking something doesn't mean you can't criticize it.
440,"Hold on, what the hell is spyxfamily? Is it like a shounen version of Spy Kids?"

Is miracle water the only way to come back to life? That’s the one thing I don’t understand yet.

476,Next episode has the answers for your questions.

Miracle water = Nital (react with the stone in few seconds)

bat-shit liquid = Rough Miracle water = Nitric Acid (Also react with the stone but very very slowly)

No willpower used here and the flashback isn't finish yet. (50%)

488,"I said the same and some fanboys downvoted me or something. It seems like every negative post here is getting downvoted lol. For a high schooler, they're taking it way too far with how strong he's. Again, he's a fucking high schooler !!

I like the setting, world and main character but the series has some annoying flaws so far tbh. Hopefully it'll be fixed by the upcoming episodes."
489,Agreed. Especially if the dude is just human and there's so far been no mention of regular humans being involved with supernatural shit....at least with OPM they came up with an asinine excuse for Saitama's strength that the anime itself is aware is ridiculous.. but this? Interesting to see how he'll die
490,Yup this is definitely a fantasy show.
491,What gave it away!?!?! I thought for sure realism was what they were going for! Damnit!!
492,That was a whole lot of nothing
493,"The monkey commentary was fucking hilarious.

Also the soundtrack at the beginning hyped me up for some reason"
494,"Okay probably get some hate for this but - does Senku ever become less obnoxious? Like yes, I get it, he's smart and he's cocky. You don't have to beat it over my head every 5 mins with ridiculous stuff like ""I was counting for 3700 years straight and accounting for the earth rotating by seventeen millionths of a second each year"" and the overkill use of stupid catchphrases like ""This is exhilarating."" He's kind of irritating honestly."
495,"[Manga Spoiler](/s ""He kinda becomes less obnoxious, but moreso because his caring side shows through more and because he gains more allies with different personalities to bounce off from rather than him losing his boastfulness. Although I *think* the author cools down on the catchphrases a little bit later on, I can't remember."")"
496,Not sure this is your show my dude.
497,Drop it already.
498,"I finally dropped this show with this episode. I'm not saying it's bad, but it just isn't for me. I realized I should probably just stop when I noticed that I didn't care at all about whether Senku lived (well, obviously he would, but even hypothetically if it could go otherwise). The monkeys were the final straw. It didn't seem funny to me, and seemed super out of place.

The survival mechanism seems goofy. Why didn't Tsukasa notice he was hitting stone (if he actually hit it)? Why did melting the stone fix the problem (if he actually *didn't* hit it)? If stone melt fixes unrelated parts of the body, then that is both weird and OP. Why didn't Tsukasa double check to make sure he's dead? Does he know Taiju and Yuzuriha at all from before? I don't think he knows her at all. Why does he assume she knows no science (like Taiju)? Why does he let them go?

His whole plan is dumb. I can understand being an anarcho-primitivist (kind of), but his ageism seems like a lazy way to get there. He needs to start with very small children only. Teenagers are too old (think of how many die-hard conservative or capitalist teenagers there are). There is *no reason* not to finish off Senku's friends to end the ""pursue science"" ideal (does he seriously think they won't try to continue in his legacy because he's gone?). Also, as humanity gets restarted, he doesn't need tales of his murder getting around. It might make his anarcho-primitivist allies question things. Even then, there's a lot more he'll have to do to make this actually work. He's open to mass killing and murder - letting them go just creates risk and is irrational.

Taiju's unwillingness to kill in defense of others bothers me. I would be okay with it if he had a strong moral view on the subject, but it just seems like a weird quirk rather than a moral stand for pacifism. His actions up until actual violence seem incoherent for a die-hard pacifist though (he looks ready to fight, then doesn't). 

Staying on Taiju, yelling during the Senku revival scene is DUMB. He has no idea whether Tsukasa is nearby or not. Shouting about it just. . . 

[](#wallbang)

Yuzuriha got some great characterization, but her design just looks bad sometimes. Last episode was much better; this felt like a step back again. 

All in all, I'm finding I'm too distracted by the things that annoy me. I'll check in at the end of the season to see what people think and I may pick it up again, but for now I think that's it for me."
499,"In a previous episode, they explained that the de-petrification also heals (that is why they have those scars on their faces), so I guess Tsukasa did hit the skin of the neck, but the stone left is above and that's how it will heal his neck. Still, I get the reasons you mentioned, I will give it a few more episodes."
500,"Yeah, I see what you mean. Still, it feels a bit cheesy that it can heal down below the actual stone."
501,"> below the actual stone.

***their whole body is turned to stone*** as we've seen with people who are dead, the stone is putting itself back together before turning back into flesh, blood, organs, bones, etc. They aren't magically not bleeding anymore or something. The stone, before turning back somehow, gets back together as much as it can (i.e as long as you have every part of your body it's all good)"
502,"The stone isn’t just surface-layer, it went deeper below his skin. The top layer was just the part that falls off from erosion"
503,"Often being distracted is your brain rationalizing why you don't like something on a more instinct level. And it's fine not to like something. 

As the anarchy-primitivist and young only ideas have been acted on sometimes with huge amounts of violence so I not going to dismiss that as a attractive political system to some."
504,"have you seen comments here regarding the fact that the first arc is the weakest? I think you're dropping too early with only 4 characters. Welp, not everthing's a cup of tea to everyone."
505,"I have, which is why I'm open to picking it back up again if I get sufficient reports of it *actually* getting better. So far it just isn't enjoyable enough to watch."
506,"I think this is one of the downsides of anime sticking too much to manga. Episodes like this should've been placed as extra episodes/ova. I'm a chemist by trade so of course even a little inaccuracies infuriates me, then I remember this is still a fiction. Regarding plot hmmm... Boichi is self-aware that Taiju will not appeal to the fans and will do something about it."
507,">Boichi

Inagaki Riichiro*"
508,"I cant tell you HOW its gonna get SO MUCH BETTER without spoiling it, but trust. everyone said the same thing you are when the chapters came out, but then after the next chapter, thats when the hype for the manga started. Its like the MHA first few episodes. Slow af, but gets real good once the plot thickens"
509,"It's not a good show... The whole """"science is the key"" makes you expect realism, but then is completely unrealistic. 
The entire world is overgrown after 3000 years? Nothing makes any sense."
510,I find it funny that you criticise the scientific realism yet are pretty ignorant about it.
511,"I study geology. I'm a geologist. Examine the history of the earth every day, but you got me good by calling me ""ignorant"". Sick counter, dude."
512,"If you study geology, how can you be so wrong about 3000 years being too little time for Japan to be overgrown?"
513,"hmm good question. I'll have to think on that one for a while. Wait I got it, it's because I'm not wrong.

Things would still be around. The pyramids are 4.5k years old. The colosseum is 2k years old. The Megalithic Temples are 6k years old. These were all built with shitty ancient technology, too.

We also have metal artifacts that have survived thousands of years. Rust and corrosion takes a lot longer than you might think.

Also, this man wakes up in a cave... wtf is up with that? Did a cave just grow around him in only 3k years?

All of this in addition to the fact that a highschool twat grabbed an arrow out of the air, and killed a lion in hand to hand combat... that makes less than 0 sense. It makes negative sense."
514,"All those things are still around, as we know it, because civilisation has been around them... We're talking about a never seen before event where all human activity would cease for 3000 years.

Also I never said they wouldn't be around I said they would be overgrown with nature. Not the same thing, please don't put words in my mouth.

A cave didn't grow around him, his body has been ""moving"" these past 3k years and ended up by a cave (thanks to  terrain changing, honestly the most bullshit thing isn't that he ended up by a cave but that he wasn't completely destroyed).

So you're perfectly fine with a highschool student being such a genius that he can literally bring back civilisation starting out in the stone age, singlehandedly, yet a guy that has super human strength is too much?"
515,"It's a show, so I expect to require at least some suspension of disbelief. 

Either way, it sounds like we both think it's stupid so whatever"
516,"Some things are stupid, I agree with you. But a lot isn't."
517,"> The entire world is overgrown after 3000 years?

This doesn't seem odd, but the physics is completely out of wack"
518,"It is pretty odd. If you don't believe me you can definitely look into it yourself. Wether or not all human structures would have deteriorrated and become completely overgrown, there is no way a cave would grow around the kid, or that any of the stone people would have survived the weathering that took place.

&#x200B;

But yes, I didn't even cover the silliest part which is the physics. A child grabs a crossbow bolt and also kills a tiger in hand-to-claw combat. Makes less than zero sense."
519,"The cave didnt grow around him, he was washed up there"
520,"Okay he's a really large boulder. Boulders don't wash up onto beaches (which is why beaches are just sand) and there isn't even any water around to ""wash him up"""
521,"None of this makes sense, but they couldve just done the setting more absurd and the rest more grounded. Thats all."
522,how do you mean?
523,"There are shows you can watch on what happens if humans disappeared and how many years in various locations for human development to mostly go away and 3,000 years sounds right for a geologically active area with vibrant plant and animal life like the Tokyo area would be. 
This is too easy to fact to research so I would speculate author probably got this one right."
524,"Why not? What should still be there according to you? A lot of things corrode, rust or disintegrate in a matter of decades. Meanwhile weeds go just about anywhere, paving the way for other plants."
525,"Because things would still be around. The pyramids are 4.5k years old. The colosseum is 2k years old. The Megalithic Temples are 6k years old. These were all built with shitty ancient technology, too.

All of this in addition to the fact that a highschool twat grabbed an arrow out of the air, and killed a lion in hand to hand combat... that makes less than 0 sense. It makes negative sense."
526,"Metal artifacts can survive when buried or covered by paint or oil, but not in open air without undoing the damage. Without cover it only take decades to rust and fall apart. Concrete and rock can last long, but the common factor is that these buildings aren't reinforced. In reinforced concrete can be damage by the rusting of the metal, internal forces ripping it apart and weakened by water. These also go down in decades if unattended. It takes shorter than you think. Also, try thinking of a building in that region that would last long enough without being overgrown.

Senku didn't wake up in a cave and we don't know where this cave was where Taiju woke up or that he was always in there. It is just an unknown, but bats are known to that region which is the part that matters. It just comes down to ""We don't know, therefore it makes no sense.""

Yes, that highschooler is strong. That is established early on and is now the rule. It makes sense in that it is consistent with the world, but wasn't part of what I asked about to begin with. Not realistic, but that doesn't make it not make sense."
527,"Buildings are made of mixtures of concrete and metal. Even after falling down, there would be partially standing buildings and/or large piles of rubble. 

""strong"" is one way to describe it.... ""superhuman strength superior to any living human on the planet today"" is another way to describe it... Either way, my original point was that ""science is key, all we need is science"" loses it's spark when you add in kids that are just superheroes."
528,"Yes, that is what would be there after a century. But after many of them you do get growth over that reducing pile of rubble.

I can't help you if you think that a bit of 'super' strength can rebuild society."
529,puts super in quotes as if you don't agree...
530,"It is not like they are superman or something. It is not even the kind of strength that can punch down a tree or something like that. So yeah, 'super' is a pretty good way to put it as I do find it an exaggeration to put it as if they were super.

But you are moving more and more away from the original question and the points I've made, rather dodgy."
531,"Right? They got turned to stone in the middle of fucking Tokyo. In 4,000 years, there would still be ruins of the city. It would be covered in vegetation, yes, but in this show they wake up and suddenly all signs of all buildings are gone and everything is jungle? That's not how that works. That much steel and concrete would take a lot longer than 3700 years to break down to the point of disintegrating."
532,"No you’re actually incorrect about that, these are things you can look up"
533,"Yes, they are things you can look up. You should look them up, because there's a ten billion percent chance that you have no idea what you're talking about."
534,"I have. And you are wrong. Logically, Tokyo would be uninhabitable because all the nuclear reactors would melt down and spew out Chernobyl levels of radiation into the area for millennia. Realistically, large swaths of Japan would be desolate, radioactive wastelands."
535,"It's not for everyone and I definitely can understand your frustration with some of the logic going on. I will say that you are quitting right before it actually gets into the good story line of the show/manga, this stuff was kind of just setting everything up, although you're not a fan of some of the plot points so far. If you're at all curious on how things start to progress I recommend checking out the manga and reading just a couple issues of it to see if you like where it goes. The anime is at issue 11 (out of like 113? give or take) I believe so it's not too far in yet and it is extremely faithful to the manga (so far, hopefully it stays that way). The story will be completely changing so you may enjoy it? However, I will say that there are some plot points that aren't necessarily ""logical"" and you may not like that aspect. I just think it's a fun manga and hopefully will be a fun show!"
536,"About not killing Taiju and Yuzuriha, remember that Tsukasa doesn't actually want to kill them. In the end, he only killed Senku because his knowledge was actually capable of reviving civilization. He doesn't just kill at a whim, but only if it actually helps his purpose. In the end, Taiju and Yuzuriha aren't capable of being a threat."
537,I am sorry but your questions are dumb af
538,Care to explain? Or are you just being defensive.
539,Well actually I am too lazy to .. no offense though .. long story short all of these questions will be explained later ( most of them )
540,">  long story short all of these questions will be explained later ( most of them )

If they get explained later, then why are they dumb? Presumably a ""dumb"" question would be either A) because it already answerable or B) missing the point and thus not ""answered"" at any point."
541,I mean it was obvious that they get explained later but just as u said I don't have the right to call them dumb while being too lazy to even explain so I apologize
542,"AH he has been Shane on purpose to mentally trick tsukasa to attack his neck brilliant. 

 Poor tsukasa just wanted to be a part of the flashback. 

&#x200B;

The Shiny monkey part was really funny but also just funny, like it felt like we could have skipped over it and next episode would been the same. It further added to Senku brilliant mind and his work ethics etc but imo we already had that last week."
543,"""...was really funny but also just funny"" funny funny!?!?"
544,ergo it was just comedy and did not progress the story as we already knew this. it was heavily implied how he had survived alone.
545,It will make sense why they showed it next episode
546,"Ehhh this show had such a good premise and an interesting plot that I had never really seen before. 

But I feel like they just are not doing a good job at all to get the most potential out of this unique story. The show has gotten boring. Nothing happened this episode....  Prior episodes the pace has been so boring besides like episode 1 and maybe 2. Last 2 episodes were kind of lame honestly and some parts are just stupid. Like Senku should have died 99% in that situation.... But now they just use some plot armor BS to bring him back.

Just kinda disappointed and I am close to dropping this series, I just dont find myself enjoying this show and it is a chore to watch it ATM. The only thing keeping me in this series is the unique plot and I feel like I am not alone in feeling this. Hopefully they pick this up and actually do something with the show because each of these crappy not much happening episodes is one less episode of action packed content filled episodes...."
547,"Give it literally 1 more episode and the story will change drastically. The pacing is one of the strongest points of the manga, there will be a LOT of stuff happening."
548,Maybe this show isnt for him then let him drop it no use trying to convince people even if its right before the anime takes off.
549,"This isnt an action packed show. Its a science show. But the show is gonna get better because this is just the prologue for the actual show. Trust, the next episode will put the others to shame"
550,My favourite ep yet!
551,Shiny monkeeeeeysss
552,"Is it possible to figure out why applying the elixir revives Senku with just watching the episode (or are they going to explain later)? I honestly didn't get the logic behind it, anyone?

Did the stone weakened the blow? The elixir fixes bones? what happened there?"
553,They found out from Yuzuriha's feet that the depetrification process actually has restorative purposes. They are betting on the chance that the stone layer on Senkuu's neck will heal his broken spine when it's depetrified.
554,Stone is never surface layer. It's not a shell. It goes deep beyond the tissue and muscle.
555,The elixer can heal small wounds during depretrification. This was established with Yuzuriha's toe.
556,Plot point
557,"It has already been mentioned that de-stoning somebody also heals their whole body, by de-stoning the last part of Senku they will also heal his neck injury (if it isnt too late for him to recover)"
558,can somebody tell me how could petrification save senku? i didnt quite catch their explanation
559,It has regenerative properties when triggered.
560,"The only question is if senku instantly died, can the liquid bring back a soul?"
561,Soul isn't exist.
562,"This is a fantasy show, soul exists if the plot needs it to."
563,"There is no soul, there is only science!"
564,He did instantly die.
565,I said in the episode 4 thread here it'll be something like Eren early death in Attack on Titan. :D
566,"I know Trigger isn’t making this one, but think how awesome it would be if the final battle took place in space this time - considering that was Senku’s dream."
567,Why shiny monkey ded?
568,"Honestly, Yuzuriha is the only thing I like in this show and I don't mind"
569,we almost lost our shiny monkey this early in the story
570,"I always wondered what animals thought about humans... Also if I was in Senku’s shoes at the beginning of the Stone World, I would spiral into depression"
571,I always like anime/shows in which the central character is smart and is one step ahead of others...senku always has a backup plan....can anyone recommend me similar series in which central character is like that
572,"Death Note, Code Geass"
573,Classroom of the elite
574,"There are a lot of supporting characters like this, like Shikamaru in Naruto. The Jojo characters often use clever trickery to win their fights."
575,Was expecting them to resurrect/resuscitate Senku with that lightening 😱
576,"Gotta say, I would totally watch an alternate universe show about the four of them being friends in high school."
577,"Okay I am kind of annoyed because Senku should be dead in this scenario. He should be brain dead. That was like more than 5-6 minutes without breathing or anything.

If his cervical nerves were lesioned that will take out so many important processes. His sympathetics to his heart will get destroyed and it will lead him to get myocardial infarction and loss of heart tissue in literally minutes as he will lose contractility. 

His respiratory centers would also get affected since the nerves coursing from the medulla respiratory control center to your respiratory muscles would get hit, and he would not be breathing. 

With no breathing he would get massive Ischemia within minutes. His neurons would not survive more than like 2 minutes of ischemia and his cardiac muscles would also have ischemia and they would stop beating in literally like 1 minute. Not to mention the many other implications for his other organs. Not sure what Nital can do to reverse ischemia lol but I am pretty sure it isn't a cure all for everything.

I wouldn't even bring so much science into this but the show is entirely focused on science. So I think they should at least make sure the science is correct... Kind of annoying"
578,"All Senku, Taiju and Tsukasa should've been torn to shreds by the lion. And even if we assume that Tsukasa would've somehow kill the lion, then this whole debacle should've ended at crossbow shot as catching the bolt is clearly impossible.

So at this point, I decided to stop trying to think in terms or real life logic."
579,Yeah it's straight bullshit that he will inevitably be revived and be fine next episode.
580,"

They were able to transform from stone back to flesh after thousands of years and yet this is what you got a problem with this show. What?"
581,"Because that was more of a fantasy portion of the show. Plus it could possibly be feasible if their whole body becomes petrified.

But this was just simple incorrect medicine that can never happen."
582,"But so is people turning to stone. If people that got turned completely to stone somehow can turn back to human with no negative side effects, I'd say that Senku being able to revive is fair game since all of this are just plot device anyways."
583,You cant make a story that revels in science and then ignore every fucking point of realism there should be
584,"I'm not saying that realism should be abandon all together but when the show already uses unrealistic plot devices, complaining about minor things such this is a bit nitpicky."
585,"I guess it is because there is a lot of people with higher expectations for shounen, since there are a bunch of interesting settings and ideas that are present. Unfortunately they forget that these are shounen and that shounen often disappoints."
586,"There was a dude who straight up punched a lion so hard it got launched into a tree and instantly died, and then proceeded to catch a crossbow bolt in the very next episode, and immediately after doing so, [kneed someone *this hard*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/287954023938523136/608220296385921034/unknown.png).

I think a reasonable amount of suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy an anime, but that's just me."
587,Depends on the anime
588,"amateur, first thing you do after spawning is bashing a log into a crafting bench with your bare hands.

pretty boring ep, at least the second half, i don't think that flashback was too necessary because nothing particularly interesting happened."
589,"I blame the director, the manga chapters always end real good, and if im not mistaken, the flashback what if thing was midway into the chapter. But i have confidence the rest of the manga will be adapted better. the manga had a slow start as well"
590,"average anime, overhyped but still fun"
591,Still no blonde girl

593,"my man, you're all over this thread like this

595,thats alot of speedlines over still images
596,I mean the ending to this episode would have been a better ending to the first episode imo
597,had this same thought. the pacing with this show is not good so far.
598,"Is there not enough manga material? why is the anime so slow? All the repeated talk in the beginning and all the drama are just filler. Like we all know that senku is gonna survive.

I really hoped they would kill Tsukasa this episode and focus on the crafting more.

I mean, i can enjoy drama later in the anime, but its episode 5... and i dont care about Tsukasa, who just wants to kill old grown ups, because they are corrupted? or some bs.

Give me some character developement first, then drama and death teases."
599,"I think it was just bad direction. They wanted the next arc to start off good, so they prolonged this episode. I dont know how they woulda ended this episode if they hadnt. The next part is much better"
600,Why this anime is so slow. So many flashbacks at this rate he never going in space.
601,"This is all a prologue. Next episode should pick up speed, but the whole series will have so slow parts. Sometimes science is all about the grind."
602,So they for sure showed the back of his head without the stone on it. Am I missing something?
603,His hair was obscuring it.
604,Weak.
605,Logic.
606,"Shiny monkey evolved into clothed monkey. 

They skipped mentioning the part where he found it necessary to sew E=mc^2 into his clothing to let the other monkeys know who's the boss."
607,"I'm sorry, but the pacing in this show is terrible. There are more flashbacks than plot. Its barely watchable."
608,"Dont know why you getting downvoted. I am on verge of dropping the show. Only reason I haven't is because the plot is unique and interests me. 

But they have done a terrible job at using the unique plot to its greatest potential. Literally nothing happened this episode.... Its gotten so boring."
609,"Yeah yeah, you already made like 5 different comments about how you are *totally* going to drop the series. No one really cares, if you are going to do it then do it, if you aren't then don't."
610,Next episode is when the flashbacks stop.
611,"Haven't watched this episode yet but was late to the last discussion so here are my thoughts for the series so far. The first episode was interesting. Then OP Tarzan came and ruined everything. I wanted it to be serious and creating a civilization. Sure it needs to face some problems and his ideology while stupid would've been fine if it was just killing all criminals but whatever. I'm fine with that but why can he one-shot lions and grab arrows midair and shit? Isn't there another way for them to make him a strong and powerful enemy? Come on now.
And then Senku who is supposed to be smart decides to blow off gunpowder for what reason? To alert 1 random ass person instead of playing it chill oh and why did it even come to this point? Both knew where to go because of ""weapons of science"" or some shit. Also, there is no way Senku is dead because of anime and he is in the opening and ending. I bet they'll give some stupid explanation even though Tarzan wouldn't have messed it up and we heard the sound effect.

edit: yep he ain't dead bullshit explanation.

edit2: they try to make Senku seem smart and well he is. Still can't understand his logic though. So he revives and the people around him are still stoned therefore he must be the first human to get resurrected. And previously lightning the fire was just a bad idea and bad trade-off. He himself came to the conclusion that people were beginning to get resurrected because of the time frame between his and Taiju's revival. Yet when he had the option to prevent getting detected and still have the power to create a civilization he chose to gamble with superpowered Tarzan able to kill them by lightning the fire.

Edit3: a bit less comedy, a bit less bullshit and a bit more civilization and its good in my opinion. As I enjoyed second part more than 1st."
612,"1. Everything about his survival from the neck snap was clearly foreshadowed, sure you could say it’s bullshit but so is every human turning to stone and being able to wake up from that like nothing happened.

2. He figures that he’s the only human awake because none of the animals around him seem to have ever dealt with humans before. Definitely a premature conclusion though, I’ll agree to that.

3. The smoke signal gripe is so nit picky it hurts. It’s a hard decision and sure, you could say he made the wrong choice NOW. But wait and see what happens, him throwing up that signal is one of the most important moves in the series"
613,[deleted]
614,"Ok you clearly misunderstand essentially everything about this.

1. He couldn’t remove the piece on his neck, he didn’t have the depetrification formula until a couple of days before his “death”. And he didn’t use it on himself because he kept using it to revive other people.

2. Up until he was facing down Tsukasa on the mountain, he wasn’t cracking his neck to try and coax him into chopping his neck, or to let Taiju and Yuzuriya know about the petrified area. Every time before that, he was just cracking his neck.

3. It wasn’t just him cracking his neck that coaxed Tsukasa, it was the fact that he straight up said “it wouldn’t be logical to kill me in some bloody way” and he knows that Tsukasa respects him and is going to try something fast. And as he mentions “find a clean way to do this”, he does the neck crack right then. You may not think that’s enough, but you’d be FUCKING AMAZED by how easily humans are influenced by shit like that subconsciously. Also, it’s just the cleanest option while still being easy to execute, and it’s a fast death.

4. Him cracking his neck one final time on the mountain, along with priming Tsukasa, was his way of signaling to Yuzuriya that she should keep that on her mind, which is why she thought about it.

TL:DR I feel like your fundamental misunderstanding is assuming that this course of action was always his plan, when it makes much more sense when you see it as him coming up with this plan during the confrontation."

616,"I think your thinking too much about Senku's plan. This isn't something he spent a long time thinking about, but just a spur of the moment thing. It was probably more of a hopefully it'll work out sort of plan, not something really thought out."
617,True. Still dislike Tarzan though
618,"And of course the large explosion at close range did nothing against Kraven. By this point I'd be willing to bet the biggest lightning blast in the history of lighting would be equally as ineffective.


Oh cmon Senku you can be a *little* boisterous about breaking out.


Commentary from the ape gallery. Interesting. Though where else were we gonna get outside commentary on Senku's solo adventures.


Okay I figured he'd be frustrated when he couldn't start a fire like Taiju could but when he figured that Yuzuriha could do it easier than him as well that made me chuckle a bit. That and the little mental image he had of Yuzuriha starting that fire was kinda cute funny.


You see that Wilson, Senku has made FIRE!


Lastly, I am still waiting on that Ayla girl to show up. When is she gonna get here? We've already got to the fireworks factory this episode."
619,">And of course the large explosion at close range did nothing against Kraven.

It wasn't really an explosion. The black powder wasn't contained with anything. Without pressure it's basically just super flammable. It's dangerous but not explosive."
620,"Oh really. Okay. Well even so, the large immolation t close range did nothing besides burn off his shirt because of course it wouldn't."
621,"Yuzuriha and Taiju weren't really trying to kill him either though. It's a distraction to let them escape. She threw it in his general direction, it's not covering him or anything."

631,I knew they wouldn't kill off the mc
632,As the whole season is based on Senku it is not possible to kill him at this point. Apparently he is dead but somehow his death doesnt feel so real. Lets wait for the next episode to see what the healing fluid is gonna do to him.. John Snow will be back..
633,"I read the manga so I’ll try not to spoil anything...

So I liked the way the showed senkuu in school saying “ I would find a way to save everyone “ because he stayed true to his word showing what kind of person he is. On a slightly related note Tsukasa is a badass and I wish senkuu and Tsukasa had a childhood together."
634,"did you see the foreshadowed characters in that flashback? crazy good, i gotta check the manga if they were there as well."

637,"Nice to see Senkuu friends using what they learned to not only get out of that situation but revive Senkuu. Interesting to see what could have been if Tsukasa and Senkuu meet all those years ago. Senkuu making progress towards making a shelter, making fire and gaining food was cool to see."
638,This post gave me anxiety because I hadn't seen the episode yet
639,"That was some nice spontaneous unplanned and incommunicado teamwork between Tai and Yuzu.

Wasn't the petrification on the head, not on the neck?  Why would it repair damage to the neck?

You know, wasn't Senku's counting completely useless as far as knowing when to revive, when the actual time of revival was never under his control in the first place?  When enough of that nitric acid or whatever accumulated to break the petrification, he revived.  No choice in the matter one way or another.  Unless he telepathically controlled the bats to relieve themselves on him at that exact time ofc.

Wish it showed the date of when he acquired clothing+shelter+food."
640,"I think its like birds in their eggs, they have to break the egg shell in order to get out. So he had to put effort into getting out. It's why so many people are still petrified, because they lost consciousness already. Taijuu was always thinking about not being able to confess to  yuzuriha. and senku was counting."
641,"What effort?  He was stone.  It's not just a stone shell, it's stone all the way through (though it's somehow *thinking* stone).   The only time he could've put effort to get out was when at least some of his muscles had already depetrified - and if he hadn't gotten out at that point he would've suffocated to death."

646,"I don't remember it being explained, but I think he was the only one not revived with the fluid."
647,"He was most definitely revived with the ""natural"" fluid, just check the flashback in this episode.  Just like Taiju (whom he most likely moved to the cave at some point.)"

ALSO in the shots we are given when looking behind his head (such as when he wakes up) there isn’t any stone left on it.

664,Very interesting to do a backstory of character that is dead. Usually it is done when they are still alive.
665,This must be the point where I've heard the author realized that Senku was the way to go and switched him to Main Character status.

698,"I mean it's pretty thematically resounding. Just having them pour the solution on him and him waking up right away and going ""all according to plan"" or something would've been basic. The flashback gives us perspective on the difficulties of surviving alone from the very beginning (actively made me think of those long-term video games where you're making millions of gold, dealing max damage, have entire cities, etc. now but had to grind for hours just to set the foundation for that), says that he's a survivor and he's going to survive this too, and makes the moment carry more weight.

704,How is it an asspull? All of the pieces were in place for this to happen. Everything about this was foreshadowed.

706,Broken neck is a pretty common death in the wild. I would have left in just in case and he is smarter then me. He didn't just happen to leave it.
707,"Yeah, well if I were Tsukasa I would have cut off Senku's head, just to be safe. Too many pieces have to fit too perfectly for Senku's ""plan"" to work out successfully.

1) That spot has to not come free naturally after Senku wakes up.

2) Senku has to invent de-stonefying juice.

3) Other friends have to also wake up so that said juice can be used to revive him afterwards.

4) That exact spot has to be damaged by a direct hit by something.

5) Tsukasa can't notice that spot on Senku's neck beforehand.

6) Tsukasa has to suddenly be a lot dumber than he's been made out to be by not realizing Senku's ploy and just slicing his throat or stabbing him in the heart, just to be on the safe side."
708,The area of effect of the healing properties are a bit unknown so maybe it would be fine even if he had his throat sliced.
709,"It only repairs the stone, though, before transforming it into flesh. No stone, no healing."
710,"How is it dumb that Tsukasa didn’t cut his head off?

1. The move he used was designed to kill swiftly, with little room for error. In his mind, without knowing about the most important variable in the situation (the stone rejuvenation) there was literally no way for Senku to survive, and he’s right about that.

2. He’s been established as a respectful man, all things considered, and so dumping a guy’s blood around all over the place doesn’t really fit with that aspect of his character."
711,"His character has also been established as being intelligent, cautious, and as violent as needed. You could argue it's outside of his character to not realize that the request for a merciful death was [Briar Patching](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriarPatching). That also ignores literally every other condition. It's not that one or two things had to coincidentally happen: it's that a plethora of conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Senku, have to be met."
712,Ok I'm out. Another full episode with no plot progression and nothing happens. Same spot we were in two episodes ago. The three are still on the run/hiding from baddie. Baddie is still in control. And two unearned cliffhangers in a row. I'll check back at the end of the season and see if you guys think it was worth watching/got better but for now I'm dropping it. I think Crunchyroll bet way too much on this series. So far it's a great premise that's been a massive disappointment.
713,"The 3 aren't hiding... 2 of them are trying to bring the other back, the baddie doesn't need to go after them, since he doesn't know about the healing properties of the denitrification process.

Up until now it's been the prologue next episode is when it'll ""actually"" start."
714,"> The 3 aren't hiding... 2 of them are trying to bring the other back, the baddie doesn't need to go after them, since he doesn't know about the healing properties of the denitrification process.

We all know the main character isn't going to die in episode 5. So there's little dramatic tension there. What's more, the baddie was able to track them to their exact location 10 or so KM from where they set up their base. And he was able to use deductive reasoning to figure out where they were headed AND why they were going there and he was able to catch up to them pretty fast.

There's little doubt in my mind that the guy is going to figure out what happened... he was already questioning whether or not he actually killed him in this episode. There's no way he won't be suspicious about the others' hasty escape with his body.

My sense as a viewer is that the story is moving at a snail's pace because we're 5 episodes in and three of those episodes have been devoted to setting up the bad guy with little or no plot progression and we're largely in the same exact spot we were in the moment the baddie killed his first human statue. 

Regardless of the ups and downs we have the same three people, running from baddie, with two unearned cliffhangers in a row. Like I said in my OP I'll check back at the end of the season to see if you guys think the rest of it was worth watching but so far I was expecting another Goblinslayer or Slime-Chan or even a Shield-Bro level of entertainment and thus far I'm very disappointed by the slow pace and lack of plot progression."
715,"You might as well drop it and keep it dropped then, because the level of progression you're looking for just doesn't exist in Dr. Stone and it will only make you more frustrated.

In an effort to avoid spoilers, it sounds like you're looking for a show that follows a straight path to the final encounter, but that isn't what Dr. Stone is and what makes it fun. To give you some perspective, in the manga this storyline was ongoing for around 70 chapters taking almost two years to unfold and in the meantime there were a handful of smaller arcs that continued to build on the foundation the story established early on.

Granted, while the pace is indeed slow, the progression is still there and it's building. In fact, it's been surprising blatantly with its various lampshading of later developments. The thing is, this isn't just your typical shonen battle manga where the protagonist makes a beeline to resolving each new conflict, there's more going on than that.

Everything you mentioned, while taking small detours, still generally follow normal shonen battle manga format, but that isn't really what Dr. Stone is and if that's what you want, you'll be disappointed. This episode should pretty much tell you everything you need to know, it establishes the trajectory of the story and builds on who both Senku and Tsukasa are and their disparate points of view."
716,"> To give you some perspective, in the manga this storyline was ongoing for around 70 chapters taking almost two years to unfold and in the meantime there were a handful of smaller arcs that continued to build on the foundation the story established early on.

Eeesh. I can't imagine readers sticking with what I've seen in the last four episodes for two years. I feel sorry for them. 

Another poster told me to give it one more episode as ""now the prelude is over and things are going to ramp up fast."" Are you saying that's not the case?

>Granted, while the pace is indeed slow, the progression is still there and it's building.

I would argue that there was a fair amount of progression right up until they freed the girl but ever since that time nothing of note has happened. Just the three MC and the baddie chasing each other's tails. But we've been over that. 

>The thing is, this isn't just your typical shonen battle manga where the protagonist makes a beeline to resolving each new conflict, there's more going on than that.

I'm not a fan of Shonen myself. Most of those shows take forever to complete one battle. ""Today on One Piece (or Naruto, or Dragonball, or what have you) the battle with Bag Guy 12 begins. Come back seventeen episodes from now when they actually throw the first punches at one another and twenty five episodes from now to find out who won!""

No thanks. If anything I'd say that Dr. Stone has too much on common with Shonen in that it's moving the story along way too slowly for my taste. And I should say that this is a taste thing. I'm not trying to convince anyone else they shouldn't like it... if they like it great for them. It's just not pleasing my pallet. 

>who both Senku and Tsukasa are and their disparate points of view.

Tsukasa is just an idiot. His arguments are tantamount to those made by Thanos in Avengers. By eliminating 50% of all living things he creates more resources for everyone left behind. That said he also creates a repopulation boom and that 50% that's gone will quickly be replenished in short order. Mere moments on a galactic scale. It's the argument of a moron. 

Tsukasa has the same problem. Only wake up young people? What happens when they get old? He's supporting the idea of killing people who are only 15-20 years older than he is yet since the entire world has been turned to stone it would take probably double or triple that amount of time to even come close to ""waking up"" enough of the population to start having the problems he's whining about.

Additionally he'd have to keep everyone young like himself from developing any advanced technology. He'd have to keep them all in the stone age. Because the moment another smart kid like Senku comes along and makes Gunpowder or really any other modern killing machine, his ability to remain in control is over. 

In short, Tsukasa isn't all that believable as a villain because he's expressed a level of intelligence that belies his ""bad guy stance"" because he would have to be a moron to think that his utopian idea of only waking up young people would work. Is he going to create a world like ""Logan's Run"" where everyone dies on their 30th birthday? It's sheer stupidity. What's more it ignores time... that in a relatively short period he will age to the point that he will BE the old guy he doesn't want waking up. And even if he tries to argue that as an older person himself he won't be tainted by the petty problems of the older people of the old world that is, again, him lying to himself to get what he wants.

Which is mostly revenge. He blames older people for the way things were in his old life so he wants to punish them. It's actually pretty pathetic. And he doesn't really make a very good bad guy because of it. 

One of the things I really liked about the premise was the idea of Senku using science to bring the world back and all the challenges he would face doing that. The more people there are, the more food, shelter, and supplies are needed. As the community gets larger there will be power struggles. I really liked that idea. But what I'm getting is four teenagers running around the woods arguing because one of them is mad at old people. For five episodes. 

So yeah I told the other poster I'd give it one more episode and if episode 6 is amazing maybe I'll reevaluate but from what you're telling me I probably am going to end up dropping it and dropping it hard."
717,"> Eeesh. I can't imagine readers sticking with what I've seen in the last four episodes


Well, it wasn't just that, but the point is that Dr. Stone isn't the sort of story with a typical carefree, dimwitted main character seeking adventure and overcoming one challenge after the next with a specific goal in mind. What happens during the time this storyline was running sets the stage for the rest of the story.



> Are you saying that's not the case?


Yes and no. It is in the sense that once the prologue ends the story starts moving pretty briskly and progress is abundant, but it's also a matter of perspective. If you're expecting a story where each arc is effectively bookended by conflicts that the main character must fight to overcome in pursuit of a stated goal, that really isn't Dr. Stone.

Here's a vague [spoiler](/s ""There are no battles. We don't even see Tsukasa again for nearly 50+ chapters in the manga after this."")



> but ever since that time nothing of note has happened


Like I said, this isn't a typical shonen battle manga. Of course you aren't entirely seeing what it's doing, because it isn't following familiar tropes. That isn't to say the absence of such tropes necessarily makes it good, or better than books that choose to rely on them, just that you're missing the forest for the trees. Without saying anything specific, the last two episodes alone were filled with allusions to where the series is going, they just weren't terribly blatant. Think about the content that was in these episodes that wasn't the main focus.

The neck cracking thing is the best example, it's the anime straight up telling us to pay better attention. From the first moment we saw Senku in the stone world, he was cracking his neck in the most obvious fashion, but in flashbacks he wasn't and only now several episodes later we have Taiju straight up telling us Senku doesn't crack his neck like that but he didn't think much of it until right then.



> If anything I'd say that Dr. Stone has too much on common with Shonen


[Spoiler](/s ""See previous spoiler."")



> Tsukasa is just an idiot.

> Tsukasa isn't all that believable

> It's actually pretty pathetic.

[Spoiler](/s ""You're not wrong."")



> He'd have to keep them all in the stone age.


You're exactly right [spoiler](/s ""and that's what he's attempting to do, but like Taiju, he's just a meathead, but unlike Taiju he's also somewhat clever which is a blessing and a curse."")



> Because the moment another smart kid like Senku comes along and makes [...]


To be fair, while true it isn't quite so simple. While they could potentially find and successfully revive someone that just so happens to be scientifically inclined like Senku, the odds are extremely slim since anyone with even the most simplistic understanding of that level of technology are petrified and randomly spread around the world. Finding another scientist would be like a needle in a hay stack.

And that isn't even taking Tsukasa into account. Think about who Tsukasa is, since you made an accurate assessment of him before. As of this episode, Tsukasa is both in control of the cave and the nitric acid formula. Assuming he could formulate it and start reviving people at his leisure, who do you think he would go for? Strong people he can control to reinforce his position or people that look smart who then might attempt to outwit him?

What's more, what happens if he never revives another scientist? Senku is the only one that currently knows how to even make gun powder, let alone modern weapons. He is the only one who can pass on that knowledge. If someone else comes along with a proclivity in science, it doesn't mean a whole lot without prior knowledge of that technology existing to start with.



> he would have to be a moron to think that his utopian idea [...] would work


Technically, all he really needs to do is just not revive someone that understands science and allow the past to die out. If you paid attention to his rant, it isn't just that adults are corrupt so we must build Neverland for the Lost Boys. There's more to it, it's that adults are corrupt and abused those beneath them. As such, a solution to that is to destroy not only the means of recovering society but anyone with the ability to do so. Senku's goal is to both save humanity and society, even though neither appears to be especially feasible, he's a threat to Tsukasa and his vision of utopia.

However, if Senku were gone and no one left alive could succeed him, Tsukasa's job would be done. His utopia could carry and potentially set humanity's course in the future. After he's dead, it really doesn't matter what humanity does anymore since he would have already done his part to push humanity in the direction that he felt best.



> One of the things I really liked about the premise was the idea of Senku using science to [...]


If you really did like that, I think you'd actually love the direction of the book from this point on. From the way you were coming acrosss before, it seemed like it was the lack of progress by way of action that you were upset by, but if you enjoy that sort of thing, you might actually really dig where it's going from here. This episode has already dropped some hints about where the story will be headed in the next episode and the status quo is about to change.

I am going to revise my previous suggestion, just keep watching. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by where it goes, whether or not it'll be exactly what you're after I can't say for sure, but science will most definitely be done."
718,"Yeah it wasn't action I was missing it was plot progression. You have more context and you're able to see all the little cues and clues that I can't not having read the source material. For me, it's just been boring, stock, nerd bro grows up loving science, makes a couple friends, world turned to stone, oops they unfroze a baddie, and then three episodes of ""run from the baddie"" with no real plot progression from there. 

I also question the idea that Tsukasa controls the only location where the ""magic liquid"" can be created. That seems silly to me and in opposition of what science is based on. If you can find it there, you can find it in other places. With the fires/smoke in the last couple episodes that leads me to believe that there are some other people unfrozen which means there must be another place where those chemicals can be found. If Tsukasa thinks he's the only one who can unfreeze people because he has control of the cave of magic he's a bigger idiot than I would have thought originally which, again, doesn't jibe with the level of intelligence he's already displayed in past episodes. He came off as pretty smart. But he's very conflicted in the way he's written (and therefore he's really not well written) because he's smart about some things and dumb about others and the things he's dumb about aren't things he should be dumb about in light of the other things that he's smart about... if you can follow that. 

I want to see Senku get a real forge and blast furnace going. I want to see him develop better tools, better building materials, better chemicals, better engineering and so on. And I want to see him free up some other nerds to help him in the lab, some other meatheads to help with the physical labor. I want to see him actually rebuilding society. I want to see him get magnets and copper together, dam a  river and create a hydroelectric facility. I want to see him get gasoline going and create some internal combustion for chain saws and wood mills and farm tractors. 

I think the thing that attracted me most to this was the idea of watching the technological development of human history played in fast forward. And I didn't really want to see it done with ""the bad guy of the week"" as I'd much rather see Senku and crew struggle with the scientific method, nature, and bad luck or scientific setbacks than having some meathead with dumb ideas about an unattainable utopia be the bad guy everyone's worried about.

The idea of Tsukasa showing up randomly to destroy Senku's experiments and advances, setting Senku back down the tech ladder again and again is something that I would find immensely frustrating/dissatisfying. What I'd love to see happen is (you mentioned he won't be seen again for awhile) he gets built up as a baddie consolidating power and preparing for an attack on Senku and then Senku pulls the old Indiana Jones ""shoots the guy with the sword trick"" and just takes out Tsukasa and his crew in one episode or less and moves right back on to sciencing. 

I want to thank you for the long message. In these days of limited attention spans people have often tried to make me feel bad because I type fast and organize my thoughts fast and thus my messages tend to be longer than what society appreciates. It's refreshing to run into someone who's not afraid to have a nice long talk about something (anime) that I'm interested in. Cheers. 

And I will give it one more episode. If the next one doesn't suck I'll seriously consider sticking around. There's just so much anime I haven't watched. And only so many hours in the day..."
719,"> You have more context


You're definitely not wrong, although my memories of the early chapters are more than a bit hazy at this point, so I am coming into this about as fresh as you can get when you were already reading ahead. But I get your point and I think if Inagaki had a chance to do it over again with a more concrete idea of where he was taking the book, I expect he would have conceived those early chapters a bit differently to better reflect where the book was going.

Honestly, as much as I enjoyed how the book started back then, I think a lot of that is specifically because of Boichi's art as opposed to Inagaki's writing at the time, since the latter of those early chapters ended up being a bit of an info dump, not unlike how these last two episodes of the anime have. Although, once you see the trajectory of the story, I think it starts making more sense why it seems like he rushed to fill the gaps like that and I think the anime made the best of what it had to work with.

Of course, what you'll see upon reflection is in the eye of the beholder once it's said and done.



> nerd bro grows up loving science


Technically, even though it's easy to say that, you'll note that Senku doesn't entirely follow that trajectory. If you re-watch Senku's flashback story to Tsukasa this episode he doesn't develop an interest in science until he becomes fixated on the goal of going to space and even then, despite making a declaration of his intent to go right then, he leaves class vowing to learn science to achieve that goal.

What's more, the next thing we see is his father selling his own car to support Senku's nascent interest in science. I think most would agree even parental love has limits and would look for other ways of supporting them, like buying equipment piecemeal so as not to break the bank. Selling your car, a car you presumably need for things like work, is kind of a big move to make.

Both Senku's flashback story and Tsukasa's ""What If"" take on it are interesting in that they subvert what you would expect if this was just the typical shonen battle manga and beg questions that don't make sense given such context.



> I also question the idea that Tsukasa controls the only location where the ""magic liquid"" can be created


You definitely aren't wrong, but look at it from a real-world perspective. Not only are caves not that common in most places, but while bats are a given in caves (and thus bat guano) nitric acid isn't exactly pouring out of every crack and crevice, which would be kind of a bad thing since nitric acid is pretty corrosive. Which must mean that there is some kind of climate or condition that causes the water in a cave to leach from the bat guano in the right amount to create it. But at that point, it's little more than just a coincidence that they found a reservoir of it to begin with and little guarantee finding another cave will yield similar results.

Of course, for the sake of convenience lets say they do find another well, what does it mean for them? Did Senku seem like the sort of individual that would use it to revive a bunch of people specifically to fight back against Tsukasa, when the only reason he was even going to make a modern weapon was to preserve the status quo? How about Taiju, the blockhead with immense strength and endurance that refuses to fight?



> if you can follow that


Like I said before, he's a meathead that's occasionally clever. A blessing and a curse.



> I want to see Senku get a real forge and blast furnace going.

I am not even going to say anything more, because I think the video captures my meaning without having to say anything more and I've really been enjoying your speculation. Now that we've cleared up the miscommunication, I think your train of thought is exactly in the right place moreso than many, which is also why I've lead with open-ended questions in response this time to some of your earlier points. You've got the right lens to look at and analyze the material, the only issue is you stopped after arriving at your first conclusion. What if everything is just a bit more lopsided than you expect? lol



> I want to thank you for the long message.


You're welcome, I am not prone to short messages anyway. I tend to ramble on a bit when trying to get my point across anyway and even though I was probably a bit curt back in my original response, unlike a lot of people I guess I tend to look at places like this as being somewhere that if I am going to make the effort to reply I am not going to cut it short for no reason, I am going to try and have the conversation if I can. If I want to have short, unintrusive banter I'd be on Twitter or Facebook. I've run into my share of people that balk at having long conversations here, though, so I get it.



> If the next one doesn't suck


Hmm. That might be tough then. It took 5 episodes to adapt the first 12 chapters of the prologue (which suggests around 2-3 chapters an episode) while chapters 13 and 14 serve as the introduction to the next arc primarily via flashback to Senku's revival and what he was up to while Taiju was still petrified, which were partially adapted into the end of episode 5. While it shouldn't take long to wrap up the flashback, it's unclear to me whether the next episode will also be able to include chapters 15 and 16, since that is where things start kicking off and your compelling speculation will be tested.

It might take until episode 7 for things to really get moving, though, but by then we should be well into chapter 17 and that chapter is almost certainly the clincher on whether or not the story will live up to your expectations. If nothing else, hopefully the content in episode 6 is sufficient to sell you on holding out for episode 7 at least."

Selling your car, a car you presumably need for things like work, is kind of a big move to make.

I just took that as Senku getting that ""I'm ALL in on science"" mentality from his father. Once dad saw that Senku was all in on science he went all in with him.

>Not only are caves not that common in most places

I think any WWII veteran that spent time in the Japanese islands would argue otherwise. I'm told caves are quite common there.

>But at that point, it's little more than just a coincidence that they found a reservoir of it to begin with and little guarantee finding another cave will yield similar results.

But like all things science the hard part is finding out the ingredients and how much of each are in the final mixture. Since Senku knows this already he should be able to make the magical liquid if he he can find the separate ingredients and simulate the process in which they are mixed/refined. I feel like saying that that one cave is THE ONLY place that can produce what is needed to revive people... and it just so happened to revive a huge science nerd like Senku who will recognize it's value, guard it, and so on, is a bit too much suspension of belief for me to get on board with. There HAS to be other ways to revive people.

>What if everything is just a bit more lopsided than you expect?

Don't get me too excited now. What if the next couple episodes still suck? Anime aren't ever as good as the written work and the people who make these shows can fuck up a good anime faster than you can say lickin' chicken. There's 19 episodes left and I had a lot of excitement for this show and it's pretty much let me down so far. I'm trying to be optimistic about the next episode but I have to admit I don't know if I buy one episode turning this bus around. 

>If nothing else, hopefully the content in episode 6 is sufficient to sell you on holding out for episode 7 at least.

We'll see. At the very least I had always planned to check back at the end of the season to see if the community, in general, thought it was worth watching. And I think by then, people such as yourself, who have knowledge of the source material, will have weighed in on whether or not the anime lives up to the material or not, whether it's worth watching or not, and so on."
721,"And it's still wrong. Destroying scientific advancement forever is impossible. Someone like Senku can be born again. You don't really NEED science to be scientific??? As in a child in Tsukasa's world can become super curious like Senku was and start experiments. YES T can just kill them but more like him will be born. Fuck it doesn't even have to be future Senkus but rather the kids will start asking questions. ""Why is the sky blue?'' is there more people? Can we travel further? All these questions they can bombard T with and push him in a corner and murder them before they find out the truth and start civilization all over again or force the remaining youths he didn't murder for questioning him to procreate which will take forever to form a new generation...

Also the same youths he wants to resurrect can become corrupt too. Technology or not. Unlike  **Rousseau** , T claims or insinuates technology is linked to corruption. Ro however doesn't claim this and even admits his ''morally uWu caveman'' idea probably doesn't or never existed. You don't need technology to commit rape, arson, steal, murder and exert force"
722,"Technically, it isn't impossible it's just impractical. There are several examples of attempted genocide in our world and while those failed too, unlike them Tsukasa's goals are more realistic since humans in general are flawed animals that are not just prone to following with established dogma, but humans are also prone to social hierarchies where the strong control the weak. Building a social order targeting and suppressing 'science' would be no more difficult than that of an order targeting anything else... like, say, so-called witches during a particularly dark period in the 1690s.

Furthermore, just because someone might be born with a scientists' spirit wouldn't necessarily make them a scientist, nor would it make them a threat to Tsukasa. You're missing something important here, while someone could be born with the same drive as Senku, they're being born into a Stone World with nothing to aid them. Just look at Chrome, a natural-born scientist in the stone world. Even though he didn't have to start from scratch for some reason, he was still at the rock collecting phase and has only taken a few steps into that world. Despite knowing a lot about very basic science, Chrome just doesn't know enough to build society. He doesn't know enough to even use what he knows practically, though he tried his best.

By contrast, Senku's advantage is that he was there when the world ended. He has tens of thousands of years of cumulative science and other knowledge and first-hand experience with society, what it was and how it functioned. That is a tremendous advantage that literally can't be duplicated in Stone World and it's so much knowledge that he could literally spend the rest of his life trying to pass it on.

Once Senku is gone, all Tsukasa would need to is interfere with any obvious examples of 'science' he finds and manipulate those he has revived to follow his lead until anti-science becomes an overarching part of the culture. After that, time and human weakness will make sure it's effective (religion proliferated in much the same way after all). Once the scientist is dead, their 'research' will fade away with them, the next one wont know how to make heads or tails of what their predecessor learned without leaving behind a trail.

Remember, science is all about building knowledge successively. It doesn't work when those who know can't pass on what they know.

Also, that's because Tsukasa is an idiot meathead. He comes from the dark side of the world, where he and others were mercilessly and cruelly taken advantage of by the rich and powerful. As such, he's only able to see society from that narrow view. It isn't that simply destroying technology will end corruption, it's that Senku wants to revive modern society and everyone with it, regardless of whether it would hypothetically go back to the way it was. Corruption and all. By stopping science and only reviving children Tsukasa is trying to excise what he believes is the cancer of the old world to allow the remnants of humanity to follow a new path.

Whether his vision is correct or not, as long as society isn't rebuilt and humanity fully revived, mankind will have to start over and in the process find a new way forward. Of course, whether that path follows a similar trajectory as the first time through remains to be seen."
723,"You need to build up the characters not just progress the plot. But ok, you do you."
724,"The generic science bro backstory stuff just wasn't all that revealing or interesting. Just seemed like a bunch of science nerd forms trio of friend tropes. I wasn't particularly happy with that part either. It's one of the other reasons I'm dropping it.

But I'll be back. I'm sure if it's worth watching I'll be hearing a lot more about it by the end of the season. And if it continues to suck well then maybe I'll have saved myself some time."
725,I'd highly suggest to give it 1 more episode.

727,"Indeed. [Slight spoilers for story structure in next ep](/s ""The next episode is where the prologue arc will end, which was by far the most boring/slow part of the manga, it was not even clear back then that Senkuu was the protag instead of Taiju. So if you had problems with the pacing I'd really recommend to give it 1-2 more episodes."")"
728,":::Sigh:::

All right. I mean I love anime so I'll give it one more episode but honestly if the next one sucks I probably won't even come back at the end of the season. Do you know how many episodes this show is getting? I know most of the time it's 12 but with Crunchyroll all in on this show I'm guessing it's going to be more like 24 or so? I don't want a show that's going to be around for that long to be this bad. So I really do hope they get their shit together."
729,"24 episodes. Again, I somehow understand how you feel, the prologue arc is just..meh at best. But there is a reason why I have Dr. Stone as a 10/10 on my manga list, and that's due to what comes after."

At least we got a bit of how Senkuu awoke and how he started to prepare everything before Taiju awakened. Did they really have to put voices to the monkeys? Lol. Even though I'm accepting this show for what it is - in order to enjoy it - it's freaking difficult lol my suspension of disbelief is at its limits. Too many things take you out of the show."
735,No rules or limits? How so? Seems fine to me
736,"Yes fisticuffing a lion, totally legit."
737,Buuuuut it’s consistent within the world? That’s like saying a fantasy can’t have any consistency because they can throw fireballs

739,"It wasn’t “supposed to be”? Who are you to decide what it was “supposed to be”? What it is is what it was “supposed to be”, because it’s what the author wanted it to be. And it’s basically just turning human limits up a few notches for a “heightened reality” kind of setup. It’s not fantasy.

Also, Jojo’s is really good, soooo...."

749,This was a pretty eh episode for me. Nothing really happens other then *pretends to shocked* Senkuu surviving and Senkuu's backstory. Comedy wasnt that great but strangely the animation was really good.
750,Really boring episode. Probably only 30 seconds of actual story progression. They teases that blonde girl and didnt show her either. Pretty disappointed.
751,I really thought senku was dead tbh I nearly cried from shock but what really put me off was that half the episode was just filler and flashbacks. the monkeys were funny tho

1.a thing put in a space or container to fill it

when I say filler it applies to the anime and manga, meaning that it is time-wasting just because they do not want to show what happens next. it did not feel like it was even an episode it was just flashbacks, guess it's going down the shonen hole. idk why you guys are downvoting ur just a bunch of salty bitches"
