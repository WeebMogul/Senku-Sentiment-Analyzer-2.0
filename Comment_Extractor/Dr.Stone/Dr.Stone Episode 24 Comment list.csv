1,For those who wish to pickup reading the manga i recommend starting on Ch 59. While the anime covered everything in the prior chapters it diverged chapter ordering for the last two it covered in the final episode. Because of this i don't feel confident saying it covered up to ch 60 even though it did in a roundabout way.
2,How much material that is available has the anime covered?
3,"Chapter 133 dropped today.

So the Anime at Chapter 60 has covered slightly below half of the current story."
4,"(Transferred my comment here because I forgot about the Source Material Corner. Sorry, Bot-chan!)

That endpoint though. But hell yeah, excited for Dr. Stone Season 2: Stone Wars! At least they somehow managed to end it in a hook that gets you excited for what comes next. It's been an awesome ride, even as a Manga reader. The anime was great. And confirmation of S2 is awesome.

Hopefully the second season reaches up to the point just [Manga Spoilerinos](/s ""before they introduce Ryusui. Maybe tease the 'Why Man'. Then the Treasure Island Arc could begin in Season 3."")"
5,"Considering we just adapted 60 chapters in 24 episodes, we should reach the middle of [Arc name](/s ""Treasure Island"") if we get a two cour (though it would be a really annoying place to end S2) and if we get a one cour then it'll be up to around [Name spoiler](/s ""Francois revival? "") or maybe [Spoilers](/s ""Farming""), not sure, but [spoilers](/s ""Ryusui is revived at chapter 85"")"
6,"It would probably 12 episodes since the stone wars arc is not that long. However, if it's 2 cour it will probably end after [ Manga spoiler] (/s""they build the ship to head to soyuz"")"
7,In both cases S2 will end at a weird place. Since stone wars wouldn't take 12 episodes and the next arc afterwards is pretty huge

What an excellent finale. Goosebumps when Lilian and Ruri was shown together. From 1 generation to another a perfect legacy using music.  The montage of Senku's journey and the games tv movies manga gave me the feels. As a manga reader i think they selected the right chapter to end it. Its sets the perfect hype and tone for the next season.  Hope they time it in Spring also.  Kaseki flexin while being moved by song. 

For all Anime only. If you are planning to read the manga start from Chapter 1. Boichi's Art and extra scenes is definitely worth the read.

For those who are waiting for the next season. I assure you it only gets better and better similar to the Scientific advancement of Senku.

9,"Not disappointed with this adaptation in the least. I hope they host the animation quality slightly going into Season two and follow a “hero academia” approach to this anime instead of the “Food Wars” take. The Mangas story and and line work is solid, now it just comes down to if they can properly convey that in the next season."
10,What is the difference? Mha vs food wars
11,"Hero got substantially more focus and high quality animation as the seasons continued, popularity grew, and the stakes of the plot rose, the more the studio worked with the characters and setting, the better and more detailed animation they were able to pull out. 

Food wars stayed the same kind of quality of animation, sound, everything. In fact I’d maybe argue it got worse in pacing and using the “chibi “ art style for gags instead of exploring the character models. 

Different kinds of stories for sure, but when you start comparing manga to anime, you can see which ones got love from their studios. (Also see Attack on Titan vs One Punch Man)"
12,"I know one punch man, but what's up with AoT?"
13,"Attack on titans another example like hero academia where the animation team goes above and beyond, elevating the source material with each season."
14,"Oh nice, thx I only watch season 1"
15,"cool, looks like i shouldnt have stop watching AoT since season 1."
16,So s2 would probably end with them setting off to find the source of petrification. S3 would be where the manga currently is with Pet. Island. Long wait ahead of us.
17,if its a 12 episode season 2. Ending it with the refrigeration of tsukasa should be just right
18,12 eps would be ok

46,I have to give massive props to how good [Senku's VA](https://myanimelist.net/people/26705/Yuusuke_Kobayashi) is. Dr Stone is a good manga but his voice acting alone makes me want to say the anime is better. AND we're gonna see him again playing Subaru in April. I need him to voice more stuff.
47,Omg that's how he's so good! I loved Subaru back in the day. Thank you for this info!

89,I literally just said it's good and that a main character will be a part of the story I don't see a problem you can literally say that without having read the source
90,"This show rewards you for your patience but in saying that, the pacing is good and everything just flows nicely. What a fantastic show. Pumped for season 2. The Stone Wars are coming! 9/10"
91,I wonder if there's going to be death or will it be more of a Cold War.
92,"I doubt so. Don't forget, this is shounen after all. And this show just doesn't seem like the kind that'll kill even a single character in a battle."
93,"A few of those goons tsukasa sent over got killed by the poisonous gas. So maybe there will be some violence, but you are probably right."
94,Don't forget the thousands of defenseless statues that Tsukasa murdered.
95,Nothing a little flex tape cant solve.
96,"no blood, so they are fine. Maybe bruise in some bits and pieces, but spit some saliva and they be fine."

98,"""This is shonen after all.""

Also Shounen Jump: everything that happens in Chainsaw Man

The rules seem more lax nowadays. But Dr. Stone is marketing itself as very child friendly."
99,Eh AoT is a shounen too.
100,Maybe...
101,And what did this anime wrong to not be a 10/10?
102,"Honestly the start of the show was pretty rough. 5 episodes in I was ready to quit entirely. Pretty much as soon as the village got introduced, the show turned out alot better. Before that it just felt like another generic shounen."
103,"Man I love the show and the manga but there were episodes where the animation was shit. IIRC, it looked like some Flash animation with only the mouths moving for a good part."
104,probably just higher standards for 10/10
105,Why should I give it a 10/10?
106,"This show wasn't that great. It's very reliant on montages and it gets very repetitive because you know there will be hardly any set backs or failures for these really complex creations. Senku just goes HE HE HE and then Mary Sue's his way through the science. He's basically a God. It's honestly boring to watch for me. There's no tension because a God cannot fail. 

Writing wise, there are some weird decisions like why prioritize a cell phone over weapons? How does Senku know for sure that they won't attack or harass them during winter? I know they're bluffing having guns but wouldn't tsukasa at least scout to keep tabs? Also when Tsukasa initially fought Senku he could have easily died had Tsukasa hit literally anything else besides his neck. There's just so many bad assumptions that just work out perfectly through out the story. It's really baffling, I haven't seen anyone ask these questions."
107,"I responded to this already but since you copy/pasted I'll truncate it.

Communication is more important than weapons, which they can make already. 

Attacking in winter is a stupid idea for any military operation unless you are completely prepared for it. In the stone world, dying of exposure is a real problem. 

Everything going the hero's way is kind of a staple of shonen.

Did you even watch the show?"
108,"Ikr everyone's like ""Definitely a 9.5/10 or 9/10"" Like WHAT EXACTLYYY DO YOU WANT??? It's just perfect the way it is. The way it is I can't even find a complaint even the first few episodes they kept me on my feet wondering how it's gonna go from then on out. And outstandingly smart man in a stone world?? 

Throughout the entire manga and anime one thing alone made me question it and that was Tsukasa beating a lion with his bare hands, that was it. That was if I was really finishing for trouble, if you looked at an anime like ""Highschool prodigy's have it easy in another world"" Then yeah that shit is wildly annoying because they can do shit just cuz they're smart or cuz of plot convenience. When in Dr. Stone everything had its own steps. 

Sorry for my lil rant, proceed to praising this amazing last episode~"
109,"That's just you dude. The show is amazing but it isn't a 10/10, those ratings go to shows like Attack on Titan, HxH and Fate Zero. It had a really boring start for most people but it manage to go a full 180 and be one of the best animes of the year, but calm down.

Ps: It's just recency bias, after some time you'll realize what I mean."
110,But Attack on Titan is awful.
111,Ok
112,Souka boomer
113,"It can be a 10/10 for you though, that's totally fine. I've also given 10/10s to shows that aren't really 10/10s but I enjoyed A LOT when I watched it. Whatever floats your boat"
114,I accept your apology
115,"If anyone complains this show's pacing is slow, it's because they have absolutely ZERO idea of ""pacing"". 

One of the strengths of this series lies in it's writing. It manages to both keep things going while also giving time for character moments, dialogue and uses comedy masterfully. 

In short, people that say the pacing is slow thinks that pacing is synonymous with fights or battles (whatever forms they may take)."
116,"Such a great detail to leave a song for this generation that probably never even thought about the concept of music or singing like Lilian, or the technical level said song has, as you can imagine is hard that in many generations someone didn't came up with at least tribal songs and such. Even if the great prestess was told about music transmitting it would be very dificult.

Every episode since the second revival of Senku has been entertaining af, truly a great manga and now a amazing anime, Dr Stone is such an unique shonen."
117,I loved their reaction when they heard the song. Everyone is completely stunned by the music.
118,i'm sure everyone would be

120,So we can 100% confirm that Lillian got together with senkus dad?
121,I wish someone (Gen or Senku himself) himself just said that it's his legal mother who's singing.
122,"What? Lillian met Byakuya on the space station/ship,why do you think she would be his mother"
123,Legal mother he said so basically step mom
124,No legal marriage after the apocalypse. You'd have t wait a few thousand years for the clerk to depetrify to file for a licence.

127,Oi u gotta loicense fo dat?
128,"There must have been a captain in the space crew, and captains can legally marry people."
129,"But you still need to apply for a license and wait a week before having a ceremony, at which point a license duplicate is filled and submitted by the officiant to the municipal register of wills where the license was originally obtained. The whole process takes about a week after the marriage itself."
130,Oh you don’t say? /s
131,biological does NOT equal legal
132,"It's still technically his mother. She married his father.

There's no ""step"" here, since Senku didn't have a mother previously that he could remember. Lillian would've been his mom had the personification not happened."
133,"Probably, but that was 100 generations back or so.    Everyone was fucking their cousin by the time we were 2 or 3 generations removed from the ISS crew"
134,The crying is basically me
135,"Because it’s their first time hearing music probably. Everyone would be stunned if this was the first song they ever hear. But I think it would be funny if they all develop their own music tastes eventually.

136,"Spotify gave out usage stats for the end of the decade, and in 2017 I listened to 170,000 minutes of music through spotify alone.

139,"Yeah, unfortunately i've been using youtube music more lately, so my hours on spotify have gone down the last 2 years, and youtube doesn't give me those stats :("

142,"They do. Even without passing it down, pretty much every culture develops their own kind of music."
143,Percussion instruments should be the first thing theyve discovered musically since percussion is pretty much universal in humans.
144,"just pick a stone and a piece of wood,you'll have music.I never thought about it,but it is strange that the Ishigami village didn't develop any sort of music at all."
145,Not even any [hamboning](https://youtu.be/sb-2VsE2y-U).
146,"Thousands of years of inbreeding didn't leave them horribly deformed (except for few), but made almost all of them completely devoid of any thinking potential. The only two people actually interested in stuff after 3 000 years were Chrome and Kaseki"
147,"> but made almost all of them completely devoid of any thinking potential

Come on, that's not true. They're regular humans, some of them sharper than others, but they're not stupid, or they wouldn't survive.

It's not like the fact that they have a primitive village means they're idiots. Humans from 50,000 years ago were probably just as smart as humans today, they just applied those smarts to different problems - mostly of the ""not dying"" type."
148,It's been thousands of years and most people in that village didn't bother trying anything new until Senku came up
149,"You don't understand how technology, or stone age societies, work.

In real life, most of humanity's history took place *before* even just the agricultural revolution. For hundreds of thousands of years all we had was stone tools, fire, and maybe skins to clothe ourselves, but little more. However, ""primitive"" people are all but dumb. Read ""Guns, germs and steel"" for an interesting look into this - the main point is, technological and economic development is an exponential feedback process. When everyone is busy hunting and gathering for a living there's neither the resources nor the incentives to start developing technology. Agriculture itself is probably not very convenient, and finding species to domesticate is *hard* (in fact, we found pretty much all of them in our first few millennia of agriculture). Anyone living in areas without good candidates for domestication (e.g. Australia) was simply out of luck. By the way, that is probably one of the reasons why people on the Eurasian block ended up being massively more technologically advanced than the peoples of Africa, Oceania, or the Americas by the time the age of colonialism started. They just had a great headstart.

Once you have agriculture, you have a food surplus. A food surplus means some people can live without producing their own food, and that means you start getting specialized roles - craftsmen, witch doctors, priests, and kings. From there on, it spirals out ever faster. People with more free time can invent more stuff. More technology improves food production. The surplus goes up, more people can move from agriculture to other activities, and so on and so forth. 

The people in Ishigami village aren't stupid. They just have bigger priorities than technological development. It's one of the ways in which Dr. Stone is fun but unrealistic - if the villagers had *really* used so much labor to help Senku build his contraptions, they would have simply starved. A more realistic take on this concept would require the first technological innovation to be in food production. Once you have a steady supply of food, everything else follows."
150,"Well of course they do, every culture in humanity has developed music. What they haven't heard is a professional singer with the backup of modern instrumentals."
151,You could infer they sang. None has professional voice training.
152,"The village did have music before, just not up to this level.

Remember Suika playing her flute on the ramen cart?"
153,"They did not say they did not have singing or music they just said they don't have anything like a Professionally Trained Singer.

Almost all top singers actually train their voice using well studied methods from centuries and modern technology. Only a very lucky few don't need formal training and even they heard great singers and sung along picking up the knowledge instinctively."
154,"Yeah, that's the thing. Pick the best possible singers among a pool of billions of people, and train them with all the expertise and tricks developed throughout centuries, and well, you get something that's downright superhuman for the standards of a small stone age village. Same way as an Olympic runner would run loops around their fastest hunter. It's just a whole different level. In those 2 million years we didn't just learn how to build things, we learned how to use and condition the human body to do incredible things."
155,"Yup, and I think a big thing people are forgetting in the comments here is how much time these people train while back then you simply would never have that kind of time to train or hone that craft until you get you get to at least deep into the medieval age and even then.

The vast majority of their day pre-science is simply surviving the day and gathering resources, spending hours a day practicing singing simply isn't going to happen or you would starve. Sure some might hum or sing at meals during work but modern signing and art is at a level of them doing it day in and out with feedback beyond what would be available in these times."
156,Singing is also Science as Senku would say
157,"To a man of science, music might not seemed significant in the grand scheme of things but it's so important for morale. Did you see how pumped up the villagers are after hearing the song?"
158,"Music is super simple, there's no they didnt think of the concept of music and have things like drums and rhythmic chanting, the technicality of the music would be the impressive thing for them"
159,I haven’t watched the anime; could you explain what is good about the anime? I am considering to watch it (I’m caught up on the manga)
160,"The voice acting and soundtrack are the big ones. The voices for pretty much all the characters feel perfect (Ginro took some getting used to for me but I love it now). The soundtrack as well is just really, really good. It adds a lot to some of the moments in the series which on top of the pretty decent rercreation of Boichi's art makes a really great watching experience. I was also caught up by the time the series started but still felt the weight of some of the big moments in the series when watching it in anime because the voices and soundtrack are so good."
161,"sounds like the anime does the manga justice, I’ll definitely pick it up!"
162,"The manga readers are saying that if anime-only watchers like me want to start reading the manga, thing I'm planning, do it from where this first season ended. That should give you an idea of how faithful is the adaptation."
163,"there is sound, animation, color, voices."
164,"> Such a great detail to leave a song for this generation that probably never even thought about the concept of music or singing like Lilian

I honestly don't understand why they don't have music and singing of their own.  Just about every culture, including untouched South American / African / etc tribal ones, have music and singing and dancing, don't they?"
165,"They have music, just nothing like a professional singer backed up by modern instrumentals."
166,"While the record did have a professional singer, I really don't think she was backed up by any modern instrumentals."
167,"> that probably never even thought about the concept of music or singing like Lilian

I can buy that they'd be awed by hearing a song composed with modern techniques, sung by one of the best trained modern singers. Though they might as well find it just alien and scary for how different it is. But no way they don't have the concept of music, IMHO. Music is as simple as hitting a log with a stick. Humans without music would probably reinvent music instantly."

177,The headset itself defo is based on psvr
178,"Thats not just the Monkey King, that's Journey to the West, as the main characters is there.  Starting on that and ending on Dragon Ball, which started as a Journey to West re imagining but grew into something so much bigger in and of itself is such a great metaphor for the plot of this show as well as the steps of the original become the building blocks to things so much greater."
179,"Fun fact about Journey to the West and Dragon Ball: Sun Wukong, the monkey king, is literally just called Son Goku in Japan."
180,thats captain nemo from 1000 leagues
181,Captain with the Disney Movie Version of the Nautilus. (used to be the big ride in Magic Kingdom)

You called?"

192,"I just love that they put the Switch and Goku on the same level as 20000 feet under the sea and Sherlock    
They got their cultural priorities straight!"
193,The switch was supposed to represent gaming as a whole (hence the PS4 like controller) guessing they used Dragon Ball to represent anime and gaming somewhat as it easily is the anime/manga series with the best gaming track record and is the most popular anime series worldwide. Also both stone and dragon ball are jump properties
194,No love for the obvious playstation?
195,Evidently not :/
196,Nope. Nintendo for life baby!
197,Why is there a PS4 controller with it......
198,It was symbolizing gaming.
199,"Confirmed, Dr. Stone takes place in an alternative universe where the partnership between Nintendo and Sony did not fall apart."
200,"A.k.a., the timeline where the human race was nearly wiped out by a petrification beam."
201,"What a fantastic way to end this season.  The fact that byakuya and the other founders made a record is just brilliant, not to mention that every time we see byakuya on screen, we see more and more of why senku is the way he is. And putting in lilians song, perfect. It still amazes me that they brought in a native English speaker to sing her parts. And the reactions of the villagers to their first taste of music was perfect, capturing what it's like when you finally find that perfect band or song. Plus, with a confirmed season 2, (not really surprised, but definitely excited) I'm glad they didn't rush to try and start the stone wars before the end of the season. The wait cant be any less painful, but im looking forward to it."
202,It's obvious they share the same blood even though they made Senku adopted or something because incest...even with thousands of years gap.
203,"I think I actually saw in one of these threads a few weeks back that the author was forced to make him adopted, but yeah. They are absolutely related."
204,"Which is dumb, but I guess if it means they get to tell the story they want to and Shonen Jump gets less angry letters from people who don't understand how genetics work, so be it, whatever."
205,It's fiercely stupid because an isolated 40 person village would be brimming with incest anyway. Senku is probably the least incestual option they had in generations.
206,">Senku is probably the least incestual option they had in generations.

As long as you ignore every other revived individual."
207,"Well, most of them want to kill them so they have to.

That leaves... just Gen."
208,Don't forget about Ogawa and  Taiju!
209,"The Village had defense in a very defendable spot. There have to be other tribes out there. Not close but out there. 
Only would need a gate like thing if Wild Animals the only problem."
210,"Don't you remember, one of the points Tsukasa's faction had for Gen was a harem, but in this village he can get one thanks to being the only fresh blood!"
211,"Well it's been 3700 years of difference, they are barely related by this point."
212,"When the 6 person founder village concept originally came up I was very tempted to do a village tree under, shown, likely, and optimal conditions.

Shown being going through the anime and trying to figure out who each kid belongs to, and how many there are, then matching them off.

Likely: Assuming couples stay monogamous and the kids match randomly only excluding their own siblings.

Optimal: Village abandons monogamy, which does end in the females basically being baby factories (Also very risky to be fair) and then matching the next two or so generations based on maximum divergence.

Even with the optimal, which would be some real shit, and so unlikely, things would be sooo incestuous. Especially when the founders died and they lost simple genetics"
213,"Until last century or so females were always baby factories. With 3/4 of children not making it to adulthood plus frequent war, starvation, very iffy medical care, hideous sanitation even killing adults at higher levels. 
The worlds only current tribal group ruled by women (no word for father) and others of the past show it does not have to be ruled by men but every group had to make most women baby factories."
214,"Oh I'm aware, but when you only have three females that is also dangerous, as childbirth back then killed plenty of those baby factories."
215,"Most metrics I've seen in studies have indicated that the minimum viable population size for *any* species would be at least in the ballpark of 50 organisms. Wikipedia indicates:

>The so-called ""50/500 rule"", where a population needs 50 individuals to prevent inbreeding depression, and 500 individuals to guard against genetic drift at-large, is an oft-used benchmark for an MVP, but recent study suggests that this guideline is not applicable across a wide diversity of taxa.

Suffice to say, reducing humanity down to 3 breeding pairs, and then trying to repopulate up to a village size that appears to only just barely scrape 40-50 members is *catastrophic* in every respect. The MVP rule is often used to indicate whether or not a population will survive the next 100 years, let alone the next 3700."
216,"well with humans we tend to be an exception to most rules and they did make it the optimal starting 6 that they could have

1 astronauts are screened for alot of genetic disorders hence very low chance of predisposure to hidden genetic diseases. this cuts a huge risk out of incest breeding and cuts the required viable population as well

2 international space station means there is about as much genetic difference as they can get.

3 if they abandoned monogamy you could further cut down the viable population

&#x200B;

with the first 2 factors it reduces the population needed to about 15 which means 6 is still not enough but sure as hell increases the chances by a fuck tonne

also given that they mentioned island hopping there should be at least a few more villages along the way from byakuyas island and japan

also mvp rule for 100 years is only because the first 100 years is the most dangerous its basically a great wall so once ur over it a species is generally safe"
217,"Yeah hence why I wanted to do it, wanted to be a bit of a dick and show how incestuous it was, and see if I could delay it with ""Smart breeding."""
218,"I believe that, in order to make proper genetic variations to restart a species, you need 10-12 unique genetic sources in order to spread out genetic material to avoid bad mutations to the human genome and handicaps resulting in significant reduction in survivability.

After 3200 years, that genetic pool would be so shallow, they'd all look like Mantle after the 3rd generation.

3200 years with an average life expectancy of 30-40 years, that's 86-92 generations starting with a handful of people. Modern medicine being a problem, obviously life expectancy would drop. Second, pregnancy would be a high risk with 40-70% infanticide and a 20% chance of death to the mother.

I guess the one unmentioned part is, if they weren't high functioning like mantel, did they throw them into the ocean?

(I studied sociology in university, but my statistics are probably off.... It's been a long time)"
219,"I bet Byakuya's his uncle or something that adopted him legally (aka a kinship adoption), so both answers are correct"
220,Senku is adopted in the same way that every sexualized loli is actually 100+ years old.
221,I find it hilarious that Kohaku seemed to be worried that she was related to Senku when the entire villiage is descended from six people.
222,I heard a theory that the one who caused the petrification is gonna be senku’s real dad though there’s nothing really to back it up yet. it’s a plot twist that I can see happening even though it’s kinda dumb.
223,"My tinfoil theory is that it was Senku who did it via some Interstellar-like BS. The show is called Dr. Stone after the petrification's healing abilities. Regardless of who did it, it seems likely that the healing is/was necessary to prevent humankind's extinction"
224,i mean it did stop global warming which could wipe oout humanity
225,The way they didn't rush and try to start stone wars was one point of many that this show is seriously a top contender of Anime of The Year.
226,"Absolutely. But man, what a year its been."
227,"One curiosity, wouldn't they be boggled by the different language given they never heard another one before? I thought they would address it"
228,"Maybe the first generations kept multilingual learning. Only one of the six founders was a native Japanese speaker. It’d be more likely English would be the derived language. Of course, having no language drift (in either Japanese or English) is just as unlikely as avoiding genetic implosion after 10+ generations from only six people."
229,"Yeah, ita one of the few not so accurate points in the story in my opinion. They kept the storys in Japanese, I could understand that, but the fact that they all use the same ezact language from 3700 years prior? That doesnt even happen in the real world. Language now is drastically different than it was 200 years ago even"
230,"I’m a native English speaker and Shakespeare is a pain to read, and it’s technically Modern English and less than 500 years old. Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales is less than a 1000 years old, and its Middle English was practically incomprehensible when I read it in high school."
231,"Yeah, but Chaucer is worth the effort for the Miller's tale if nothing else."
232,Absolutely. The Miller's tale alone made me enjoy that book.
233,It's never said that they are understanding the words of Lilian's song. They probably aren't.
234,"They aren't, that's my point"
235,I just wish the lyrics didn't sound like poorly translated Japanese.
236,"Yeah, it was a little wonky in the language, but really, listen to any song written by the japanese for the English language, like the smash ultimate theme. If you listen, they only wrote phrases, not a full song. Its just cool that they tried to keep it accurate that an English speaking popstar would sing in English"
237,#HELLA LIT
238,"These subs are getting modern. ""Meme. "" ""Lit."" What a lexicon."
239,#OH DAMN!
240,"Meme pretty much fit though, so I'm not really that mad about it. Not sure about 'lit' though."
241,meme didn't really fit at all. How is a comedy sketch anything like a meme?
242,"Before we get into it, I'll ask you. What is a meme? A meme is an element of a culture, an idea, or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another; spreading to person to person by nongenetic means, especially imitation in a culture -often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme.  A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.


Okay so now that we got what a 'meme' is out of the way, I'll explain what a 'Manzai' is, the word they're using that got translated to 'meme' or what would have been translated to 'straight man'. There's one particular style of traditional Japanese comedy called Manzai (漫才), which is a type of two-man act. One man is called the Boke, who is the buffoon; the jokester; the funny guy. The Boke will make jokes, many of which (to American audiences at least) are groan comedy. The other member of the pair is called the Tsukkomi, and his job is to react to the Boke's jokes (often critically), taking on a role very much like ""the straight man"" in Western comedic practice. The archetype got so famous over the generations of being passed down as a type of comedy, to the point where it ended up getting a name because it was so famous; to the point where it can be loosely translated only somewhat well into English as ""straight man"" as it's closest eastern relative.

Now, [let's get to the actual screenshot aforementioned.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/caaaf359ea4546701139c437c71732df/df0ae0888b2761e8-e4/s500x750/7c167098aa5df2826d5c99c462758f2b249366d4.jpg) He says 'you just made me go along with a meme', which makes sense in context given that you can't really spell out that 'you just made me go along with being the Tsukkomi' in english very well, and saying 'Playing the straight man' wouldn't translate the full idea of what's going on here. The implication is that Senku's dad passed down another idea or 'meme' to the future generations that wouldn't have even existed in the stone world, except this time it's just what a 'Manzai' is; since there's definitely not any form of T.V shows or skits to go off of due to it being a stone world. 

So in the end, why was it justified being called a meme? Because 'Manzai' is an element of culture; something that can't even really be translated to the east as 'Straight man' without loosing most of the meaning behind the word. Remember, memes can be ""**an element of a culture, an idea, or system of behavior** that may be considered **to be passed from one individual to another**; **spreading to person to person** by nongenetic means, especially imitation in a culture -often with the aim of **conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme.** **A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas**, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, **speech**, **gestures**, **rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme.""** And what was done specifically for the village, to the point where there were 100 stories based on them? He passed down memes, and even gave context behind it so that it would become 'enjoyable' to 'meme' about. Plain and simple. The word itself has gained some infamous reputation due to being overly used in social media, but the meaning itself still holds true even today; and shouldn't be ignored just because it's used to the point where the meaning gets blurred, because this is one of the best ways to use and represent memes in a good light."
243,"The premise of your argument is pretty flawed, since you're using the traditional interpretation of ""meme"" instead of the more common modern expression that specifically refers to internet memes, which has a whole different set of parameters when compared to the traditional use of the word.

Also, I still fail to see how translating it as ""playing the straight man"" fails to get the point across."
244,"> I still fail to see how translating it as ""playing the straight man"" fails to get the point across.

I think the word has to be something pretty specific (like ""Manzai"" or ""meme""), or otherwise what Gen says next doesn't work"
245,"It's not flawed though? They're using the traditional version of the word, along with the more common expression. Just because you're upset that it was used in a more traditional way than the common expression (which it was used in the common expression anyways) doesn't suddenly make what I said moot, because that's literally what it is; as spelled out in my 4 paragraph long essay that you seemed to have skimmed across otherwise you wouldn't be asking me this right now. You could easily say that they're 'memeing', because they're playing off of a Manzai comedy sketch routine that was passed down by the 100 tales; an a element of culture that wouldn't have propagated or been used if it weren't for Senku's dad passing it down via aforementioned tale. Which is what happened, and literally what a 'meme' is supposed to be in the first place, something conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme. The reason why 'playing the straight man' fails to get the point across is because the idea of 'playing the straight man' doesn't bring home the fact that it was another archetype that was passed down by the tales, not something that was just assumed as a LOL SO RANDUMB scene. It's like how the idea of Christmas is passed down from generation to generation. Notice how literally nobody in the village knew anything about Christmas, because it wasn't passed down from generation to generation or 'memed' into being perpetuated into existence by an idea. Not sure how hard it is to comprehend, because I've sure as hell had to spell it out at least 10 different ways so far. If you get upset because it's being used properly instead of improperly, then go yell at the people who decided to invent the word meme; or better yet, the people who decided to modernize and flay it into the word it is now instead of what it was (and still is)."

247,">If course I skimmed over your fucking Ted Talk of a spiel, you expect me to actually read all that shit?

Whoops, there goes any form of argument you could have had; out the window, just like that. I'm sorry I wasted my time with someone who'd rather be purposely ignorant as a justification to yell at people who try to explain it to you, even after you yourself asked them for an explanation on how it is how it be. It could easily be explained in a sentence, but your ignorance lead me to type it fleshed out, just as you wanted; and we saw where that got us. Absolutely mind blowing."

It's a concept that we've never really explored before, and fuck did they do it well. If this show keeps up this level of quality it will compare with Attack on Titan for the most 'Masterpiece' like anime I've ever watched."
271,"It's definitely one of those anime that not only adapts the manga faithfully, but also add a whole lot more charm into it."
272,"Don't get me wrong, Dr Stone is definitely an AMAZING show that I didn't know I would like it so much but it definitely isn't on the same level as Attack on Titan. But of course, if you enjoy it just as much that's your opinion and I respect it"
273,You’re right! It’s way better than AoT to me.
274,"That's an interesting opinion right there. AoT is not for everyone though, I can see that but it sure is an on going classic."
275,"It's definately not on the level of Attack on Titan.

I said it CAN be on the level of Attack on Titan. Big difference."
276,That's not what your first paragraph says.
277,"And Ledgends of Galactic Hero's remains the elite's all time favorite. The remake is good hope it continues to be made but all 110 episodes, four movies and 52 prestory already out there although dated animation."
278,"The concept is great, but the execution is what makes it truly amazing. Which is something I can't say about Attack on Titan."
279,Huh
280,"Just because the anime has some great moments doesn't mean that it keeps it consistent. 

Masterpieces should be good in every aspect. Characterization, plot progression, world-building, pacing. AoT has entire seasons that fail at least some of these aspects.  It's a solid anime, but it has its weaknesses.

Sorry I'm not blinded by the hype. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
281,"Are we watching the same show? 

I personally don’t feel like going into an in-depth reply of why I know your opinion is shallow considering you seem the type to have “made up your mind already” but AoT is and will be when it finishes, indisputably a masterpiece. 

It also doesn’t make your listing of “story analysis bullet points” more poignant or valid when you add   “not be blinded by the hype”. It screams a sense of elitism or a hipster-ism. It doesn’t make you cool to not be blinded by the hype. Hype exists for A REASON.

I’d say you’re blinded more by your sense of jadedness and elitism."
282,"Why the sudden ad hominem?

I'm just saying that AoT is good compared to most anime and I think masterpieces should transcend this barrier. Like Berserk, Full Metal Alchemist, Cowboy Bebop, Akira, Ghost in The Shell and Evangelion, as an example. 

Don't need to take it as an offense, I'm just stating my opinion. No need to throw personal attacks."
283,"Again, you’re extremely presumptuous in thinking that I’m reacting without some sort of argument or intellect. It’s odd to think that I’m taking offense. You can assume tone all you want but I’m just keeping it real with on how you’re coming across. I’m not personally attacking you. 

Also you’re just listing classics. It’s cool if you wanna hold onto the old and “sound smart” but honestly it makes you come off as biased and just a hater. Lol 

Attack on Titan is literally transcending those classics. Name a currently running animated series, bbc series, hbo series, etc. that is better than it. I doubt you’ll find anything close. But if you’re goal is to sound like a clickbait YouTube reviewer then by all means, continue on in ignorance. 

Now, I’m assuming in my next sentiment, but I feel sorry that you can’t celebrate and recognize such a feat and achievement in story telling when you seemingly already have the knowledge of other greats. 
I hope you reconsider, the party’s more fun when you’re not such a critic of something just because it’s “hyped” or “popular.”  Trust me I’ve been there.

I’m sure if this conversation was in person, you’d understand that anything I was saying isn’t meant as a personal attack. You clearly, just based on your list, earn respect in that guard. My honesty is just adhering to that respect."
284,"How's that NOT a personal attack when you're literally saying that I'm being elitist and a hipster. 

You wanted me to cite other animations? Well, it's quite easy actually: Violet Evergarden, Castlevania, The Dragon Prince, Final Space and even Rick and Morty (despite the idiotic fans, it's still a groundbreaking show). But I can easily cite Avatar The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra, that while are a little bit older, can be on that places as well.

Keep in mind that those that I cited I'm putting it equally with stories in other media as well, I'm not just saying they're great for animations. They're great in general, which I don't think Attack on Titan is. But It's probably because before watching Attack on Titan I've read and watched a ton of stories that had similar themes, inspirations from outside japan culture and because of that I wasn't blown away by how different it was. 

To me, Attack on Titan's intrigue and message are a little bit too on the nose, which are the best aspects of the story, for me, along with the world-building that's undeniably well developed (the weapons, clothes, lifestyle, etc. Except the 3DMT). I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters, specially useless Eren, and most of the side characters were just cannon fodder to be killed and Gantz just did it first and better with more likeable characters. 

As I said, Attack on Titan is good, really good. But when you've seen other things before it, it kinda takes away a lot from what makes it good, at least in my point of view, because I've seen it done better, which is why I can't say it's a masterpiece."
285,"So basically what I said my man. It’s clear you’re allowing personal experience to cloud your judgment. I get your opinion and I’m glad you provided substance to your blanket statements prior. But still, it’s disappointing that your own experiences took it out of the masterpiece realm for you. Unfortunately being jaded can ruin a lot of things. 

But forreal, that Rick & Morty shit is true. I couldn’t watch it for SO long because of the fans. But it’s truly a dope show. I’ll have to watch Dragon Prince and Final Space I haven’t heard of or seen those.

Also, I though Korra was pretty wack, granted I never finished it! But I shall give it another go. Haha 

I will say, the characters are some of the most developed characters in fiction. I’d definitely give them another chance. 

Also I’m curious, what do you think the intrigue and message is of AoT?"
286,"you are absolutely off the goop here, I really have no idea if you're baiting here, having watched more stuff does not cloud judgement, it literally does the exact opposite. if you were to send Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill back to the early days of film and show it to them they'd think it's a masterpiece because they dont have any reference points to compare it with.

Watching more and more stuff to expand your knowledge and understanding of what makes something good is one of the most basic axioms of media criticism, denying that just makes you come across as a fanboy that refuses to accept his show might not actually be the best thing out there.

I can certainly name more than a few shows made in this decade more groundbreaking or deserving of the title of masterpiece than Attack on Titan, and that doesnt mean I'm jaded, it just means I've seen more of what anime has to offer."
287,"Lmao what? 

It’s odd getting 3rd partied by someone who couldn’t grasp the meaning of what I was saying. 

So to clarify since you’ve taken my words out of context:

I’m pointing out that if you yourself watches only shonen apocalyptic political melodramas and you watched SO many of them prior to viewing AoT, it would make you jaded towards that kind of plot device. That’s quite simple. That stands with anything, if all you watch are sitcoms, when a new one comes along, it’s tough to get rid of experience and bias and can most definitely make you jaded towards it because you feel that “you’ve seen it before”.

I didn’t say, “consuming more media clouds your judgment” as your rebuttal shows. 

It sounds more so to me that you’re off the goop my guy. 

Also I’m sure the shows you “can certainly name” but didn’t, aren’t anywhere near the same as AoT. So naming them would be pointless. Masterpieces stand out and above the rest and will be remembered throughout time. AoT is definitely doing that currently and will continue to do so. 

P.s. I’m not some fanboy. It’s literally a part of my job to consume as much media as I can. Also, If you truly read anything prior you’d understand the merit to my words."
288,"sure, tell me whats your job and I'll give you my list"
289,"Meh, it’s hard to find the motivation to respond to someone who won’t even rebuttal with sustenance. 

But I’m a writer/performer/actor/musician. I don’t necessarily care for your list since you’re showing me you don’t really care to read and respond to everything, just what’s relevant to you."
290,"what exactly am I supposed to respond to? three comments ago you said:

>So basically what I said my man. It’s clear you’re allowing personal experience to cloud your judgment.

then less than 24 hours later you said that is NOT what you said? its disingenous at best

the fact that AoT doesnt stand out if you watched more of the same genre before it is absolutely a point against it being a masterpiece because a true masterpiece is supposed to ALWAYS stand out. shows like tatami galaxy, kara no kyoukai, shinsekai yori, ping pong, katanagatari, hunter x hunter 2011, madoka magica, shows like those will *always* stand out to a large majority of people, regardless of the material you have previously consumed, *that* kind of show is what you can call a masterpiece. AoT is compararively just a popcorn flick, nothing wrong with enjoying a popcorn flick, but its also not a masterpiece just because you personally enjoy it.

and what is it with your take on classics? saying ""berserk is old while aot is recent"" is not exactly an argument either, there's a reason berserk is still fondly remembered to this day, it does a lot of the things AoT tries to do but better. if thats the way we're gonna look at things we might as well argue Darling in the FranXX is a masterpiece and comparing it to evangelion is irrelevant because it came out 20 years ago

oh and by the way, you really have no guarantee AoT will be remembered 20 years from now, stuff that's popular one moment can very easily be forgotten the next"
291,"> Also I’m curious, what do you think the intrigue and message is of AoT?

It's been a really long time since I've read the manga (three years, easily), so the little I remember about the ""message"", as in the core theme of the story, is what the protagonist's wish was in the beginning: Eren wanted humanity to be free of the constraints of the wall and for humanity to become more than just lambs to the slaughter of the titans (I think he compared humans to cattle, i can't be sure). 

I've gotta say, though, that one of the biggest disappointments for me regarding the series happened pretty early on. 

It was the fact that Eren became a Titan. It's entirely an opinion of mine, it's not a piece of bad writing or anything, in fact the animation is quite impactful (even if the manga drawings were pretty lackluster, never liked the art to be honest), I just expected something vastly different in that aspect. I was expecting Eren to lead humanity to a better place through his merits not on the backs of the enemies superpower (pretty common shounen trope, actually). At least my expectations were subverted in that aspect, because Eren became a useless character until the point I've read (right around the talking titan appeared), so the part of ""beating"" the titans with their own powers was ironically subverted. But it was a major take away, I expected him to get that Mikasa filled later on, but albeit with less shounen protagonist power levels (somehow only Mikasa and Levi are competent at killing giants for some reason).


Regarding Dragon Prince, I think you'll find that even though it's more of a teen show, the story doesn't shy away from mature themes and the way the characters handle them are way more mature and well developed than the vast majority of the anime you find out there, with better dialogue on top (I'll never get over the fact that so many anime and manga have such a shitty dialogue, even some of the good ones have some terrible lines).

As for Legend of Korra, if you're not a butt-hurt fan of The Last Airbender, you'll notice that all villains of that series are masterfully written and they embody their ideals and challenge the avatar not only physically but philosophically as well. But even more important than that, it's a unique show because each villain acted as a foil for Korra that, unlike Aang, a monk who had his shit together from early on, she needed to grow emotionally. Another very important aspect that many people that watched didn't gave it enough credit was because of how entertaining the story was while featuring villains managed to bring into discussion their respective ideologies in a engaging, deep and meaningful way. Each of them left their mark in the Avatar and in the world."
292,"To start, To be fair regarding Legend of Korra, I watched it MANY years ago. I was Much much much more naive  than now. I wouldn’t doubt that I missed something great so I’m definitely gonna give it another go! 

2nd, that honestly makes me want to watch Dragon Prince more. I love the slice of life or dialogue heavy written stories where it’s alllll about the characters interactions and word play etc. I’ve found stage plays do some of the best work towards that. But I agree with you on the manga dialogues. They can almost always be pretty shotty, but that’s mainly because Japanese doesn’t translate well to English. Nor are the translators writers/playwrights/poets etc. Conveying the meaning of the text is almost always lost when you translate it from the source material. 

And I’m not sure where you are in the story so I don’t want to spoil anything so I’ll try my best to articulate myself. 

So what’s cool about Eren’s SUPER trivial wish and message at the beginning is that it only evolves into a more dangerous one later. Isayama once said he was inspired by a cold interaction with a person on a train. How humans lack so much interaction and you can really feel like there’s no way to communicate sometimes with others and that that’s why he created the Titans(along with his love of giant things). The whole show does an amazing and delicate job of slowly bringing the viewer along to completely change their entire view of the Titans. 

If you ever read more of the manga, overtime it really makes you start to feel empathetic, and regretful of your hate. You start to understand the Titans more and what they are. It’s a long journey, that hasn’t finished yet so I can’t completely solidify my personal main theme for the show, but at this point it does such a good job of teaching how to understand and be an empathetic person. How to communicate. To really listen and dive into someone else’s thoughts and try your best to live in their shoes even through hatred which is tough to do. 

Alongside that with the newest chapter, there is a HUGE element of promoting freedom, moving forward(advancing Titan) in life and beyond towards better things. To fight for what’s right and try your best to survive in this cruel world(ours included). There’s much more but those stand out to me as being HELLA important throughout the show/manga. I normally wait til the shows over to really grasp the “main theme” and the “why”."
293,"Oh. I got it pretty early on that Titans were humans and were probably caused by humanity. The whole ""humanity must unite against a threat"" was something I've seen in Watchmen (Ozymandia's plan), which made me understand quite early what the titans were about. Couple that with the information pretty early on that titans always came from the south and I instantly knew it was something along the lines, I may have not gotten the specifics but the general idea that titans were humans and were probably something created to force humanity to unite (which clearly didn't work since petty politics and lame nobles were still a thing).

Here are the factors that made me realize those things: Titans always came from a single place, their faces were pretty humanoid and some characters even end up recognizing some of them (later on one guy find a titan with his mother's face, that was just confirmation for me), then the titans always swallow people whole and then get the fuck out of dodge (implying some kind of capture), another factor that also helped was how Eren became a titan, which lead me to think the fancy titans were people as well (he literally exploded into a titan several times).

So yeah... If I don't think Attack on Titan is a masterpiece is not me being petty, is more a confluence of facts that took away from the story for me. 

I also admit that I don't like when people just keep screaming ""masterpiece! masterpiece!"" just because they found a show that's better than most shounen garbage and isekai trash people see these days, much like those Rick and Morty fans claiming intellectual superiority because they watch the show (the 200IQ meme comes to mind). As I always repeat in my discussions about AOT: It's good. But it's still short from a absolute masterpiece. Maybe someday I change my mind, but so far, the story never blew me away enough for me to call it a masterpiece. Not like Berserk did, nor like Violet Evergarden, Legend of Korra/ATLA,FMA, Dune Saga, Neuromancer, Ghost in The Shell, Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction, Mr. Robot, Breaking Bad, Arrival, In Bruges, Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing Missouri,The Lobster, Firefly, Luther, True Detective, 1984, Brave New World, Crime and Punishment, The Kingkiller Chronicle, Ergo Proxy and others.

Also worth noticing that in this list I don't feature my favorite manga ever: Tenjou Tenge and Air Gear. I love them so much that I actually enrolled in translation just so I could get them to more people. I love the characters, the battles and some of the plot, but they're nowhere near masterpieces, but I love them anyway.

PS.: I've been checking some recent chapters for AoT, to see ""what's it about"" and I commend the author for finally moving the story forward (the Lost-approach to storytelling from the first 60 chapters I've ready was grinding my gears, it seem like Eren's basement was 10.000km away, when it was just at the edge of town)."
294,"I suggest definitely giving it a read all the way through. The story really opens up. It’s complete throughout and extremely well crafted down to the last detail that on a reread or rewatch, all the information was always there for you. So it makes sense you come to those conclusions mainly because I think they wanted you to come to those conclusions. 

I guess for me, is when I start speaking on whether something is a masterpiece or not, I stop talking about what I like and don’t like and just what the body of work is. Like I love Godzilla movies but they aren’t quintessential by any means lol 

Like a lot of people don’t like listening to Bach, or Mozart, or Beethoven but they are masterful composers and created many masterpieces that have last throughout many generations. And personally I think AoT will end up doing that too. The final set of curriculum for a “masterpiece” is always its cultural impact and if it stands the test of time. I firmly believe it will.

I had a feeling we’ve seen a lot of the same shit and man, that list has a lot of my favorites on it for sure. That’s WILD for me to see. It’s rare you have people really having such a wide range of media. I’ll definitely check some of those out for sure man. 

Don’t be surprised if I randomly hit your dm raving about a show you mentioned! Haha 

It’s funny cause I feel the same way you feel right now towards Berserk. I just couldn’t get through it. SOMEDAY I will though. I must haha"
295,"You should start with Mr. Robot. It has some slow parts, but I've never seen a story told in such a way. This fourth and last season has been great and I can only expect a masterful conclusion. 

I've been meaning to read AoT at some point, to see if it really holds up. When I dropped it I was a little fed up with it, but since there's a pay off in the end may help me read it further."
296,I’ll check it out for sure!
297,"Holy crap, that was a satisfying finale. Byakuya is second-best anime dad. Between the village and now the record, he has passed on some amazing gifts to Senku. 

What I love about this show is that is captures the thrill of discovery. Senku has taken all sorts of stuff we take for granted and made them exciting and full of wonder. I am so glad season 2 is coming soon."

321,"Bakuya is such a jerk lol. Bout you can tell that Senku understood the  ""i love you message""from his dad. [Senku](https://i.imgur.com/6jD30yp.png) and [Bakuya](https://i.imgur.com/asP4wPP.png) were about to cry. It shows just how powerful science is, beign capable of delivering a message thousands of years in the future.

. He needed a way of inspiring the people in the future, and using a song that touches people's hearts was probably the best idea,"
322,"For senku, bakuya knew that leaving something like that, something that senku could only use if he rebuilt science to that point, was the best way to convey how much he cared for senku."
323,Byakuya sounds like a drunk guy to me. Good thing Lilian did all the singing
324,dat bard buff
325,"This is probably my favorite shot of the season.
https://i.imgur.com/e2ayUKV.png

Such a powerful moment of contrast between Lillian and Ruri.  They share a similar appearance but are worlds apart.  I think Lillian's voice reaching her descendant here is bittersweet, a glimpse of the birthright that was stolen by the petrification.  That theft of the world's beauty is part of what moves Ruri to tears."
326,That's what I loved about this. It was a reminder that these are the voices of the villagers great x? grandparents. This is the voice of distant family inspiring them to march on. No scientific tips would have helped. Just the literal voices of your ancestors motivating you personally.
327,"And, I mean... the voices of people *dead since 3000 years*. Hell, we know records are a thing and it still would be mindblowing to hear, dunno, Socrates teach a lecture. To people who know nothing of that going from the story of Speaker the Bee to actually *hearing your village founder and the angelic voice of his companion singing*... that's, like, a downright mystical experience. It's like being there to witness the fulfillment of a prophecy. It would shake you to the soul.

Actually, perhaps that's one of the things I like best about this show. It doesn't shy from feelings we could call spiritual - but it makes them come to pass through science. Science is usually portrayed as the domain of cold, rational individuals, and sure, Senku fits that mold, but the best moments in the show are all about how science can create beauty, emotion, awe and wonder."
328,"Chrome : Ruri...I love ~~Emilia~~ science!

[Me :](https://honeysanime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dr.-Stone-Wallpaper-500x280.png)

If I watched this show 15 years ago I'd probably be in a laboratory now. Easily a 9.5/10 from me and S2 can't come soon enough.

[](#modsalute)"
329,">If I watched this show 15 years ago I'd probably be in a laboratory now.

I chose to attend a physics competition instead of going on the antarctic expedition I was invited to as a youth. Sure, now I can pretend to be like a dumber and more obnoxious Senku as an adult, but I think there's a fair chance that that expedition turned into A Place Further Than The Universe. I wish I'd gone.

Sometimes, anime makes you feel like you missed out on something great and wasted your youth, even if you didn't really waste it. Both this show and A Place Further Than The Universe had those emotional... spikes through the heart, at least for me."
330,"I completely agree with you, this is exactly how I felt."
331,That show was a true 10/10.
332,Same that show really hits home.
333,How did you get invited on an antarctic expedition when you were young? Aren't they incredibly selective?
334,"It was basically the same kind of plot as A Place Further Than The Universe, except they were more proactive about looking for participants. I was very politically active in high school as an environmentalist and my teachers knew it since I often had to skip class to go protesting. 

When someone was looking for high schoolers to go and blog/do social media outreach from Antarctica specifically regarding climate change, my biology teacher asked me if I wanted to go because she had been contacted about finding suitable participants. I had won a few other high school science competitions, but since I was more interested in physics than biology, I was unsure and thought I might have to prioritize the international finals in the physics olympiad instead. I didn't really have a long grace period to think about things though, so since I didn't accept immediately it effectively meant I declined.

Tl;dr: I had the opportunity to be more Greta-like but prioritized my own education interests instead."
335,"Damn, getting to the international finals of the physics olympiad is insane - I can see why you chose that. How did that turn out ? 

I've got this dream of going to Antarctica one day but it's going to take a while even if I ever actually get there, if I want to be there to do actual science (and not as like a deckhand on an expedition ship). I imagine it's going to be harder than ever in the future though, since we're trying to limit environmental damage as much as we can considering climate change."
336,"It was fun but competitively it went terribly. The other people who ended up there were actual geniuses and I was just an adhd kid who lucked my way through by getting hyperfocus-triggered at the right moments. Also met my ex there, and that also went terribly, but I did end up making a lot of connections to the international community, so indirectly that did set up my future relationships which have been going much better :V

I don't think Antarctic expeditions appeal to me enough to want to go there as an adult - I'm used to the Nordic countries, after all. I'd have to go to Antarctica *because* of the science, not do the science *because* it's in Antarctica. When I was younger though, the experience would have been more meaningful regardless of my research priorities."
337,"Not gonna lie I bet you could pitch that story as a show or comic or something.  It even comes with built-in cliff hanger.  

""So you made it here after all...""  turns to see the Ex-GF in a very Scott Pilgrim like presentation.  I'd watch that shit"
338,"The best part was during the free time at the competition venue, when the Japanese team saw my friend and I were playing pokemon cards while cosplaying Star Trek, they ran off and came back with a bag full of pokemon figurines and offered us any of the original 151 we wanted :)

They'd brought a bag of pokemon figurines to the international physics olympiad finals. That's dedication."
339,"See?  Even has built in ""the friends we made along the way"" for when you inevitably get stomped"
340,">  even if you didn't really waste it

Idk, some of us spent most of our life depressed and asleep, then tried to work abroad for a year multiple times and that went miserably as well"
341,"> If I watched this show 15 years ago I'd probably be in a laboratory now

this and Cells at Work are series I desperately wish I had when I was a kid. they probably would've sparked a lot more interest for me"

346,EEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEE
347,"Having worked in a laboratory, it's pretty much never this exhilarating so I hope that gives you some solace.  


Kurisu from Steins;Gate is more accurate in saying ""99% of science is boring"""
348,"> If I watched this show 15 years ago I'd probably be in a laboratory now

I wish I could say the same. I always loved science, but I don't have a mind disciplined enough. I have no idea how I managed to become a programmer."
349,Very relatable. ADHD but mathematician? How do I even exist without causing a contradiction?
350,"Doctor Stone was probably the most rewarding anime of this season. Every episode after Senku meets Kohaku is one amazing build up after the other and everything building up to this season finale was extremely satisfying.  No anime had the same impact on me this year like Dr.Stone. and it was extremely faithful to the manga, Boichi must be crying in happiness right now.

For me. it's easily the best contender for anime of the year and i hope it wins.

[PSA that Season 2 is confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/ea55k0/dr_stone_season_ii_teaser_trailer/). But since there's not even a release window, we will probably have to wait an year or two..."
351,"Probably one of the most unique anime watching experiences I've had. I was actually eager to learn something new every episode and not many anime have that effect on me, the opposite is more standard. Usually, I like to turn my brain off but Dr. Stone actively kept me engaged."
352,"I've learn more useful science on Dr.Stone than in an entire year of High School. 

That should tell how good this anime is."

360,Yep great Sci Teachers like mine in Junior High make it fun and exciting. They combined their class rooms because the wall was removable and taught a double size class but that allowed them to make great displays and demonstrations. Way to much fun in science if you can teach it right.
361,">.... or/and how bad your high school was.


Yeah, I dropped physics and biology like a brick after high school but a lot of things that Senku did were still familiar to me and it was kinda awesome thinking alongside Senku to solving the problems. This show is so damn awesome and has definitely shot into my top ten of all time."
362,"If you like basic explanations of complex scientific principles, I can't recommend the ""children's"" book The Way Things Work enough. Growing up with that book pushed me to become an engineer as an adult, and I still go back to it to reminisce. Hell, I go back sometimes when I need an ELI5 on a concept that won't stick when explained normally. It's the proof of the saying that anyone who can't explain their field to a child is a charlatan."
363,"“You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.” Albert Einstein

Although it have to be him teaching her as Relativity still blows my mind even though I keep getting closer to understanding. 
Still not sure on that quote as I have been told you really can't understand Relativity and other things  unless you understand the high level math involved.

Want fun blowing your mind try PBS Space Time. racecaracecaracecar you might do better understanding Space Time than I."
364,"Thanks, I'll give it a watch. I accept the facts of space time at face value, but I'd be lying if I said I had a functional understanding of it. Weird because concepts like false quantum vacuum and probability collapse make sense, but the actual concept of time dilation is still something I know but don't understand."
365,Oh the cringe.
366,">we will probably have to wait an year or two

368,"If you think these actors only do one project at a time, I have some news for you. 

They, uh... don't."
369,"I honestly have no idea about their workload, but if that's true that's good news. At least for us."
370,"I mean, a 12-episode (one cour) anime is four hours worth of dialogue (~24 minutes minus 3 minutes OP and ED) if they show up in every episode. If this was the West and the animation was written around the actor, you could get all of that done in less than a week, but since this is Japanese Voice acting where the dub is performed to the animaiton I imagine that it's not more than one day out of each week. I remember a few seasons back Hana Kanazawa was in like three or four shows at the same time."
371,"Their workload is probably a bit more than just that though. There should be some preparatory work, a lot of retakes, some extra time spent to make sure their voice is maintained, and of course japanese voice actors are also expected to take part in publicity events. Probably does end up taking them more time than just a week. Still leaves them with enough time to work on multiple shows per season though."
372,I apologise if I'm misunderstanding but the voice acting comes first in Japan as well.

386,This year was blessed with many great shows and my top contender would be Dr. Stone and Demon Slayer with a tough competition where both anime confirmed a sequel! My happiness can't be measured

388,I think regardless we can all agree that it was a great year for anime in general.
389,Blessed existence
390,"Demon Slayer is a very good action shonen anime so might actually win these best anime awards. But GREAT anime like Dr. Stone rarely win these official awards cause of people being attracted to action more than often. No wonder My Hero academia won an award for best anime even tho there are better anime than that (I do accept that BNHA is a very good action anime, but u get my point)

For me, the best out of the common anime this year would go to 2 anime : Dr. Stone and The Promised Neverland. For both the anime each episodes got me hyped and not a single episode felt like I was being just dragged thru with my brain off. Just my opinions.

(Even though I say that in the first para, I'd still choose Mob Psycho 100 S2 over Demon Slayer for best action anime this year. Every fucking episode of Mob Psycho 100 S2 was epic)"
391,"Jump Festa is next week, it wouldn't surprise me if we get more details there and maybe a soon-ish release date.

Last year I remember reading how Shueisha wanted to speed up the release of seasons for their properties, basically getting more involved with the studios and securing deals to speed things up. That was in the context of 'We Never Learn' and  then we saw what happened with that one surprising many for how soon the second season came out, maybe it will not be as quick for Dr. Stone but I really doubt they are going to make us wait two years."
392,I wouldn't be surprised if we get it in April/May.
393,"If you are looking for contenders for the best animes of the year,then definitely check out ""Babylon"".It's just way too under-rated.Though there are only 8-9 eps. so far."

395,Stone Wars! Stone Wars! Stone Wars!
396,"> Doctor Stone was probably the most rewarding anime of this season

I'd say that probably goes to Beastars, but maybe I only feel that way because I started reading the manga too"
397,Hell yes such a good moment!
398,My guess is summer or fall 2020.
399,i dunno this is straight up a 10/10 for me. up there with the christmas and senku birthday episode. the whole show is a 10/10. Im so glad i found this
400,"It's really hard for me to put into words about how exactly Dr. Stone makes me feel. I don't know if it's the kind of ""feel-good"" positivity that advancement brings to the people of the stone world, or if it's a kind of ""be proud"" positivity of human and scientific achievement from Senku that definitely escalated each episode. Maybe it's the love and emotions that transcend time, what Byakuya wanted to leave behind for Senku over thousands of years. 

Whatever the case, something I had quickly and easily dismissed within its first few weeks of airing coming around and making me feel such raw and powerful emotion by the end I think is truly profound. I honestly bawled my eyes out during the flashback and Lillian montage. I'm not sure why, but I think this show goes beyond its title of a ""unique shonen""... I think it's truly special. 

I'm going to miss Dr. Stone, but, man, am I ever glad it will be coming back soon to surprise me with the wonders and knowledge it brings so diligently. Get excited!"
401,"I think what makes Dr. Stone so fantastic is simply the show being a complete and total celebration of human perseverance, achievement, and ingenuity that goes leagues beyond the tired shounen tropes of “believing in your friends”. It’s condensed two million years of human discovery and invention into a few years of Senku’s actions by his incredible knowledge, and watching the reactions of both the villagers who’ve never seen such scientific feats and the unpetrified people who can’t believe Senku rebuilt this technology from literally scientific ground zero is immensely rewarding and satisfying.

It reminds us of the scientific wonders we take for granted in our daily lives (I mean I’m using a phone - something the show spent several episodes building - to comment about an anime) and reminds us of just how spectacular they are. It gives science back the mysticism it lost to a generation who grew up both surrounded by its benefits and unaware/uncaring of how it works.

In the present we understand and can easily and immediately fix nearsightedness. But to someone like Suika who only understood her condition as “fuzzy eye” with no idea or hope that she would ever see clearly, having glasses introduced to her was enough to make her cry (something you can see in videos of colorblind people trying on the glasses that allow them to see color).

That’s the beauty of the show and that’s why we love it so much."
402,Same here bud
403,"**Ginro:** Chrome this is an opportunity of a lifetime. Use this historical moment to tell your feelings to Ruri!

**Chrome:** Science is amazing.

406,He is the best girl after all
407,I was expecting him to do that thing where your mom calls you & all your friends start yelling about how good this weed is & making sex moans.
408,"Exactly, instead he legit wanted Chrome to confess his love."
409,More surprised with Kinrou.
410,"Disregard females, acquire science."
411,"If it works for Senku, it works for him too."
412,Science Aquired
413,"I expected to him to yell ""*Yabeeee*!"""
414,"He should've yelled ""hella lit"""
415,"To be fair, if I were to make a love confession I would do it face-to-face, not over a phone."
416,"Yeah, but this would've been a historic confession, as the first phone call in thousands of years. I completely agree woth you though."
417,"Given how special the circumstance was and how Ruri reacted, she would've accepted instantly."
418,"It's still a hell of a lot better than ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want you."" or ""What hath God Wroght?"" which were the first messages by Telephone and Telegraph, respectively."
419,That first message was pretty close to what he should've said though.
420,">  ""Mr. Watson, come here; I want you.""

Sounds like a confession to me.

>  ""What hath God Wroght?""

If you consider the telegraph as the very distant ancestor of the internet, that's eerily on point."
421,"Wasnt the first test supposed to read so lines from a book and the guy reading it thought the inventor cheated by having the same book and just repeating the lines, so he started improvising lines?"
422,"If you're referring to the phone, then no, it's Alexander Bell talking to his servant on the other end of the line."
423,Thomas Watson was an assistant hired for helping with the invention not a normal servant.
424,"I think it might be a bit different when the phone is a magical new invention that's mind-blowingly advanced.

But still, yeah."
425,Hopefully they won't use it to break up relationships.
426,"But this is the restart of modern civilisation though.

In another few hundred years, when they can document everything again, it will be said that the first phonecall was a confession of love by chrome."
427,science-chan best girl
428,"To be fair, even if everyone knows that Chrome loves Ruri, he'd still be making a public confession since there's a group of people on both ends of the phone. Public confessions and proposals are always awkward and I'm honestly glad he didn't confess in this scenario."
429,bu but but Ginro is kinda right. Its a historical event
430,"Damn, even in the final episode this show keeps trowing us those surprises. I honestly wasn't expecting that recording from his dad, and let alone that concert.

At first I was pretty surprised that they casted Lynn as Lillian's VA, but then decided to let someone else sing.  

In the end, it was a great decision.  

Although I would love to hear Lynn's versions of those songs (if they exist)."

440,"I know I say this alot and every year, but 2019 was a very great year for anime content. With everything that's coming, 2020 will be packed with excitement!

Dr. Stone: a 10 billion percent/10 for me. Thank you Senku and friends for bring me and everyone else for the journey through time, science, and exploration. I can't wait in store for the Stone Wars!"
441,"I am 10 billion percent invested in this story, like I wouldn't have imagined when I randomly decided to watch episode 1. As soon as the story of Speaker the Bee finished I started getting emotional and all I wanted was Senku to hear his fathers voice again. The reactions of everyone to everything that was happening was incredible. Can't wait for S2."
442,Kaseki flexing while crying
443,"I picked up it because the synopsis said something about rebuilding the world from scratch but at the same time it was tagged as a battle shonen, thing I despise, so I watched the first 4 or 5 episodes to see what was it about.

454,another request for a vertical stitch of the village with a sunset . after they listened to the record. thanks
455,"It was a nice surprise to see music predominately featured in the season finale in a show about science. While many of Senku's creations are more overtly practical and logical, it's also important to have these cultural elements. Some of the best episodes were the ones that include things such as the 100 tales, Christmas, Senku's birthday, and ramen. I like that the show not only stimulates the brain but also invokes the heart."
456,"[](#awe)

Great ending, even with some Taiju and Yuzuriha! But thank god we are getting a new season to see what's going to happen with Tsukasa.

A good 9/10 from me and it may have become my favorite more traditionalish shounen!"
457,"That was absolutely phenomenal, I think that the entire scenario was constructed and written really well and executed brilliantly. I was in tears the entirety of the time the record was playing; the entire sequence was incredibly touching and mind-blowingly beautiful, and the song stunned me almost as much as the villagers, their reactions to it were just very touching as well. I adore the dynamic between Byakuya and Senku and how even with three thousand years separating them there's still absolute understanding and trust, hell, adopted or not, you can clearly see what made Senku what he is. I'm also constantly impressed with how brilliant the so-called deadbeat old man Byakuya is, and I'm really hoping we'll learn more about him in the future.

Some other comments discuss this, and thinking about it I think I can definitely agree that since Senku met Kohaku, every single episode has been exciting and fun and was one fantastic buildup and incredible payoff after another.

I almost forgot, man, about the music thing. Music is a huge part of my life. I've been playing or listening to music, practically breathing it every waking moment for the greater part of my life, hell, I've been tracking my listening habits on Last.fm since 2009 and it shows that on 2018, for example, I've listened to 38 days and 7 hours of music at 15747 scrobbles/entries, and that doesn't count hours of youtube playlists that don't get tracked and whatnot. All that to say that I could never imagine living without having listened to music in any form or not grasping the concept of music like it was presented here, and the entire sequence, just from that point of view, was mind-boggling. I still cannot process that with how integral music is to my life, and these folks got a taste of for the first time. And it's not just that like Senku said - games, movies, comics, countless hours of entertainment that we blaze by almost as naturally as we breathe. That's one hell of an idea/concept to process, at least as far as I'm concerned.

This has been one of the most unique and entertaining shows I've ever watched, incredibly funny at times and touching in others, filled with excitement and hype, and most impressively managed to express both the sense of discovery, that ""eureka"" feeling, and the impact and gravitas of these discoveries and technologies that we take for granted and how unbelievably important they were and are to us. I never thought when going into it that it would be even remotely this deep, and I highly doubt its incidental. I'm a relatively easy-to-please watcher, so this was an easy 10/10 for a long while now, but it's become one of my absolute favorites, the next season cannot come soon enough."

This is about the best summary of Dr. Stone that one can give. Welcome to the club pal, I'm happy that you've enjoyed it this much. I'm really glad that the anime was this successful, because this story deserves every recognition it can get."
459,They have music in the village simple instrument and they infer they sing. But none is a Professionally Trained voice using the collected knowledge of Humanity on how to sing well.
460,try listening to Dr.Stone's OST. It is one of the best things for this anime
461,"> thinking about it I think I can definitely agree that since Senku met Kohaku, every single episode has been exciting and fun and was one fantastic buildup and incredible payoff after another.

This is really one of the few examples where saying ""it gets better"" to anyone who starts the show is as close to an objective fact as it gets. It's obvious to me that there must have been *something* going on on the author/editor side, because the way Taiju and Yuzuriha have been dropped and replaced with the Ishigami village gang is ridiculously abrupt, but it was clearly done to give the story more breath and variety and boy, did it pay off. That's really when the entire manga (and anime) levels up and becomes the amazingly fun romp it is."
462,"Glad I'm not the only one who was in tears.

&#x200B;

I have rewatched the episode 2 times since and was in tears every time at the singing part."
463,This was a really faithful adaptation. Even though im up to date in the manga the anime was still a really enjoyable take on the story. I really recommend reading the manga the art AMAZING and the story just keeps getting better and more suspenseful.
464,"God damn, this year has had so many good shows that I'm going to have a real problem choosing AotY. The past three years have been powerhouses, consistently pumping out top tier shows, and now Dr. Stone is the latest to be added to the S Tier genre"
465,"> I'm going to have a real problem choosing AotY

I honestly think the AotY contest is a nonsensical habit. I have absolutely loved Dr. Stone, Mob Psycho 100 S2, Kaguya, and Promised Neverland for all different reasons. Picking 1 of them over another is like saying ""yes, I think comedy is better than mystery thriller""."
466,I loved Sarazanmai. I think I'm going to do some sleight-of-hand and say it gets to stay AOTY because Dr. Stone is Anime of the Decade.
467,its a really good year for Anime
468,"So many other shows would try to rush things and end it with a big climax/war. I'm so glad that Dr Stone chose the scenic route, taking time to highlight the process for each invention etc. Its pacing is fantastic and as result, the emotional payoff for each discovery is amazing. Not many stories can make me cry the second time witnessing it and Dr Stone does it multiple times. TMS did a great job on this adaptation!"
469,"I was worried about a rushed ending too, so glad this show takes it slow for huge emotional payouts."
470,"when i first saw the title of this episode ""voices over infinite distance"" i thought it was going to be about the phone they built...

after finishing the episode i realized the ""infinite distance"" was actually talking about time. Such an amazing play on words, just thought i'll bring it up

great ending to an amazing show."
471,"Ah, so they did need a second phone"

481,WOW. I was in tears. What a great finale. So excited for season 2!!
482,"Not going to lie, I didn’t think I would enjoy this show when I first saw it. Though after 24 episodes I’m so glad I did. The shows character interactions are some of the best I’ve seen in a while which provides so much of the entertainment. Can’t wait for season 2"
483,This show really knows how to make someone emotional. I loved the entire season and what an amazing and emotional way to end it. I can’t wait to see the Stone Wars and like Senku said.....This Is Exhilarating.
484,9/10 from me and hope this show climbs a bit on MAL rankings!
485,"Very good show, I'm curious as to how they will handle the war and possible casualties, because we didn't have a one right? This season was more of a build up with comic education.

Loved the transition with the past and the present, it was really fun to appreciate many daily things for us and the rescue of this feeling about how important these science inventions are for us humans.

So I'm super excited how the war will be painted, I'm betting for a huge surprise with a more dark toned vibe, future will tell us."
486,"Not from senku's side at least, some goons got killed by sulfur-chan.

Considering he plans to save all humanity it would feel strange if all of a sudden he was okay killing any of them imho. He'll probably figure out something to take over without bloodshed, afterall the phone was all about getting intel to take advantage of the best moment to strike"
487,"I want to read the manga now so bad, but the thing is I love how in a lot of episodes I would get surprised by the turn of events like in Senku's birthday or just waiting excitedly every week to see what Senku's gonna do next, and I don't want to spoil myself. No other anime gave me this feeling before and now I have no idea what to do"
488,"Wait out, it will be worth it. You can always re-read the manga up to this point if you need some dose of science."
489,Then rewatch the anime again to compare them
490,"Sounds good, guess I'll be patient and wait then"
491,"I'd read the manga and still enjoyed each episode, seeing how they delivered the plot points I knew were coming. I am even enjoying rewatching it on Toonami."
492,"Have to say I enjoyed this show more than I expected, the wholesome, the laughs, the fights... Was an amazing experience and had more joy watching compared to Kimetsu no Yaiba."
493,"Of course Senku built a perfect record player, but Ginro is the real MVP to spin the shield at the exact right speed continuously for a long time"
494,"This was a **unusual** part to end the season.

After hype the stone war so much and spend the last episodes making a radio/phone, the season ends JUST before anything happens.

Weird pacing, i wonder how many anime-only will wait for season 2 and how many will start reading the manga.

Still, the episode was great and full of humor.

**[Everyone expected the first radio message in 3700 years to be a memorable love confession](https://i.imgur.com/1tV1VpV.png)** but Chrome is dense...like the chromium metal his name is based on **[is dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium).**

Also, it's fairly obvious **[Kohaku and Ruri have mostly Byakuya and Lilian's blood, they look very similar even 3700 years later.](https://i.imgur.com/6sM1vl4.png)** Wouldn't be surprised if Ruri wants to become a singer once the world returns to the modern era.

Speaking of songs, **[Dr.STONE OST 2 (with Lilian songs) is supposed to release today (japan tomorrow)](https://dr-stone.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Stone_Original_Soundtrack_2)**, people will probably be able to **[find the OST online](http://i.imgur.com/1cN1Hnt.jpg)** in a matter of hours. They timed the release very well to create hype, normally the OST is release weeks after the end of season."
495,"> After hype the stone war so much and spend the last episodes making a radio/phone, the season ends JUST before anything happens.

Considering the Stone Wars is an entire arc by itself there was no better point to cut it off. If they tried to cram more content into the recent episodes we would have ended in the exact middle of it, which would have been even worse.

They did a perfect job at pacing, even the anime-only small filler parts were great."

The stone wars, **according to the author**, started with Hyouga's attack.

This is already the middle of it, dunno where you got the idea this was not the stone wars arc."
497,"this episode covered chapter 59 and chapter 60

chapter 61 is called stone wars: beginning"
498,Was wondering where the anime ended thanksssss
499,"Chapter 45 is ""Epilogue of chapter 1"".    
Chapter 46 is ""Stone Wars"".    

The author separated ruri's health from stone wars by calling them ""chapters"", so based on what he says i think it's fair to say stone wars started with Hyouga invasion."
500,sure but you can't deny the name of chapter 61
501,"By the time the Stone Wars end, it will be the end of Season 2"
502,"No Stone wars arc is around 21 chapters long left, so thats around 8-9 episodes"
503,"I feel like, similar to Haikyuu's season 3, they could do a shortened season covering the rest of the Stone Wars. Probably title it Dr.STONE: Stone Wars

**edit** Just saw the PV and realized it has already been titled exactly what I expected"
504,My guess is we might only get one cour this time which covers the stone wars and probably the beginnings of the next arc. This way the anime also doesn't catch up to the manga too fast
505,im guessing we're getting 2 cours and going up to chapter 120ish and find another middle of the arc stopping point
506,"Tbh that would be great, next arc introduces some of my favourite characters"
507,"Does that include also the aftermath? They may end it when [spoilers](/s ""they've finished building the ship and are about to sail"")."
508,"That'd be around 40 chapters for season 2, I think it's ending somewhere in the middle of the current arc"
509,"> Also, it's fairly obvious Kohaku and Ruri have mostly Byakuya and Lilian's blood, they look very similar even 3700 years later.

When they are making the microphone for the phone it really hit me an idea based on the OP where Ruri(?) was singing that maybe they will make Ruri an idol to stop the ""stone"" war lol

Instead we were given a much better scene of that in the OP. I'm tearing up with goosebumps as I hear the song.

Maybe will see in the future an idol Ruri. That screenshot looks like a passing of generation quite similar to AllMight and Deku."
510,">they will make Ruri an idol to stop the stone war

I highly doubt they're gonna just go into some Macross levels of bullshit."
511,"Also, anyone that want to read the manga, from this point on the story should start with chapter 59 since chapter 60 was not fully adapted.

But i think the best would be to start from chapter 1."
512,"Meh i disagree, the problem with the anime is it is a straight adaptation from the manga, no liberties in scenes or animation. So no point in starting from chapter 1 unless you really wanna see boichi drawings you'd seen in anime form"
513,"I always tell myself ""Just resume where the anime left off"" so I can get into resuming the story immediately but somehow always find myself starting from chapter 1 anyway."
514,"I thought they ended it in a good way in terms of themes and emotional beats rather than try to rush the plot, instead ending on hyping the next season."
515,[This is mine.](https://i.imgur.com/xj3pNC2.png)

519,"Something about him just playing the record got me man. What a great way to end the season. 

I did not expect to enjoy Dr. Stone as much as I did but it turned out to be one of my favorites. There's just something *wholesome* about the entire thing. I love how fucking optimistic it is.

Can't wait for season 2."
520,"Modern day classics Monogatari and Steins Gate opened this decade of anime while Dr Stone closed it out beautifully.

 Ufotable, Madhouse, and Bones put on these huge spectacles of productions that earn them popular recognition and I can appreciate that to some extent. 

But TMS has killed it with me personally, first with Lupin and now with Dr Stone. Those 2 series were far more satisfying to me than Demon Slayer, BNHA, AoT, etc. 

Only thing I would change is Lillian’s music, wasn’t feeling it at all. Really dampened a lot of Byakuya’s scenes for me personally."
521,"The realization that all the stuff humanity made was gone after the petrification is one of the saddest things ever if you think about it, and that thought makes moments like bringing Lillian's singing back to life extremely emotional and powerful. I goddamn love Dr. Stone, and it's about to get even better"
522,"I just love how much faith and trust Byakuya put into Senku.

He came up with an obscure tale and and recorded a voice message on an improvised vinyl tape, knowing that his kid would definitely figure it out and devise a way to listen to the recording. Amazing.

And that message...

[](#akkotears)"
523,"> He came up with an obscure tale and and recorded a voice message on an improvised vinyl tape, knowing that his kid would definitely figure it out and devise a way to listen to the recording. Amazing.

Looking at it from their viewpoint... this must have been also a way to give meaning to their lives, and hold on to them instead of giving up to despair. The Byakuya side of the story is really dark, if we think about it."
524,"I mean, they were ""the last six of humanity"". They could only fling a light into the future and hope humanity would one day be able to rise enough to catch it.

And yeah, I know this answer came really late."
525,Such a rewarding feeling knowing all their hard work will pay off soon.
526,"Lilian's song was beautiful. I cried a lot.

I know it's very sappy but I wish that Byakuya told his son that he loved him. </3 I hope we get more scenes of the astronaut crew. I like them a lot."
527,"Easily one of the best anime in 2019, can't wait for season 2"
528,"Gonna be really hard not to read manga, Doran anyone recommend reading from the start or starting at the stone wars?"
529,Depends on whether you like Boichi's art. I'd say it is worth it to read the whole thing if you like the art style.
530,Gotcha thanks!
531,"Definitely worth reading the whole thing. There's not much actual material missing, that I can think of, but the art style's great."
532,"This is such a good episode, so many emotional moments!"
533,"Man Dr.Stone is really one of a kind never have I been so in love with a shonen show and manga as much as this one, and it really makes me appreciate what advancements we have irl. This show is great I shed a few tears at the singing part and now I’m even more hype with season  2 coming out"
534,"Dr. Stone is going to dictate a lot of future anime.  World building was already on the rise, and I'm guessing we are likely to see a lot more real world science in future anime's, for sure it will trickle down to more of the B list anime's."
535,"Yup.  

Knew this was gonna happen.  

That record scene had me crying."
536,"This will be one of the best anime of 2019 for me alongside Vinland Saga

Dr. Stone shows how it can be one of the best anime without relying on certain elements (beautiful visuals/good animation/fight scenes/shonen hype moments/etc) through the story itself"
537,I was gonna read the manga is s2 wasnt announced and wondering if i should still. What i liked about dr stone was each episode looking forward to discovering the next advancement and if i read the manga i wont get that for s2. Decisions. Decisions.
538,Its either you are Chrome who doesnt know whats next or Senku who knows what is comming
539,"The pacing for this season really slowed down in the home stretch, but it was a sacrifice that was necesary to end the show on a strong emotional point and not anticlimactically 1/10th into a battle. Shame we have to wait however long for a payoff, but the stone war arc is worth the wait honestly."
540,This show has been such a joy. Pure joy. Every single time these simple but well meaning villagers get amazed by things we consider every day is just such charming moment. We take it all for granted but science really is beautiful. I'm so glad this getting a season two.
541,"Welp, see you guys in 2 years when the next season comes out. It's gonna be worth the wait."
542,This was one of only a few anime thatconvince me to read the manga
543,"This show was extremely entertaining, can't wait for season 2 :D"
544,"I love the way this anime shows the value of things we now take for granted. Eletric energy abolishing the darks of the night, a simple bowl of soup, a candy, hearing someone from far away, but without doubt i loved when they listened to that record.

Having the opportunity to hear someone from 3700 years apart must be crazy, especially for those who don't even knew it was possible (the villagers). 

I cannot help but think about calm the astronauts were as they are literally saying their lasts words for the people from their generations, the old world. When Senku told he was about to make vinyl-like thing i thought the message would start normal and then everyone would break in dispair while asking whoever is listening this to carry on their duty and revive the humanity. The fact that they recorded a music was sweet but i also wish the author had put a bit of the expectations and hope of each astronaut in the message.

The astronauts had such a hard time with the weight of the responsabilities they were carrying, the same goes to Senku. I will like to see the Byakuya spin off.
Lets go Season 2!"
545,Time to read the manga now
546,"I was hooked after the second episode. Ended up reading the manga because I couldn't wait a whole week. Definitely worth it!

The anime is so incredibly faithful to the manga."
547,"this episode ends on chapter 60, so start at 61, I know I'm doing the same right now, i couldn't possibly wait for season 2 I'm just too hyped!"
548,Start from chapter 1. The art is so godlike that it's worth it.
549,"Okay, this is AOTY for me, hands down."
550,"Seriously an amazing anime. I 100% would write an essay about all the great things about this anime, you need to watch this anime if you haven't. I can get chills watching it. (Is that weird? Lol) Seriously when I think about the things this anine can do, maaan its just so good."
551,"The emotion with that message made me cry, and now I'm choosing Science for my classes in my last year in school, starting March 2020.

Maybe I even change my carreer election xd science is just so fucking awesome.

Sorry if I made grammar mistakes, English is not my first language"
552,"Okay Manga readers, I need the chapter that picks up where the Anime ASAP."
553,"The anime ended in the middle of chapter 60, so start with 60 so you don't miss anything that was left out."
554,"Beautiful show, beautiful characters, beautiful music, beautiful season finale 11/10 fucking love this show so much."
555,"Great episode! And a great way to end the first season!

I can’t wait for the second season!"
556,"Love the finale.. that Recordings being listened by  those villagers inspired and motivates them to continue the fight against Tsukasa empire...

And their 1st song being heard is beautiful. Excited for 2nd season"
557,Loved this.
558,I knew Time Capsules were going to be a plot point!
559,"Shonen getting funneled into the seasonal anime episode count tends to lead to some wonky pacing/generally weird places to stop for a finale, but dang... this series has been great from start to finish so far. Definitely reading the manga now. Anyone know what manga chapter picks up right after this episode?"
560,"Of all the ways to do it, I prefer this one. I mean nothing's perfect about translating comics to animation, if you don't even pay attention to pacing and just pump scenes out at random then you would end up with episodes ending mid-scene on really un-dramatic points. So every episode needs to be paced to end on a dramatic note, which means squashing and stretching individual moments. 

and the seasonal style is better than just running indefinitely, because if they kept running every week then either they would probably catch up to the manga by around the fall, or end up needing to run pure filler arcs, and those are always lame. I think this season ended on the perfect note, it'd take a while to reach the next natural pause, too much for them to fit into 24 eps without some serious crunching."
561,Chapter 60
562,Yeah
563,"What a show, enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. Can't wait for season 2."
564,"God i love this show so damn much man, not many shows give me that same type of feeling as One Piece, but every time i watch this show i’m so damn happy like if all my problems are gone, I cant wait for season 2!"
565,"No i was not crying, ninja’s were cutting onions here and there"
566,Called it. I figured this was a good place to stop. Either that or something they'll probably get to in a couple episodes. This was better though.
567,"that was absolutely beautiful 

what a way to end S1 and hype people for S2"
568,"What a show! So satisfying to see a confirmed season 2 at the end as well.

Also can we just agree that Byakuga is best dad of the year if not of all time?"
569,You havent seen his Final form yet
570,Final dadform
571,Knowledge of Goku is arguably one of the most important cultural exchanges from the past we've seen so far.
572,"WE GOT TO SEE TAIJU AND YUZURIHA AGAIN! THEY WEREN'T FORGOTTEN!

[](#spacetears)

Damn, what a way to end. I was wondering how they were going to fit in the war with one episode left, but they just didn't. Instead we got another amazing episode where Senku gets to hear his father's voice once more.

#***AND SEASON 2 IS CONFIRMED! SCIENCE WILL NEVER DIE!***

[**LONG LIVE SCIENCE**](#chiochanvictory)"
573,Science is the best anime ever. See you all in season 2.
574,How is Dr. Stone able to show Goku and the Nintendo Switch without any copyright issues?
575,It's possible they pay royalties for it.
576,"This was a really enjoyable anime and quite different from most. And there is a lot of potential still there, it's really only the begining. 

I would have expected a bit more from the recordings, maybe there are more recordings that the first record informs them about but we just weren't shown them."
577,SO GOOD... i just dunno if i can wait for season 2 im so excited
578,"Awesome show.

But have they addressed the issue of language drift (can you understand Middle English?) and gene pool (can a group of six people create a viable group of healthy offspring)? And assuming they can, the village seems to have few dozen people, the number seems rather small. Also still waiting for info on how they crossed the ocean (the astronauts landed in South America, didn't they? So they had to cross the Pacific..)."
579,The astronauts landed on an abandoned island circa 100km from Japan
580,"The Dr. (Stone) is out for lunch.

Will return in Season 2."
581,I'm just so glad that this outstanding series finally got the recognition it deserves. See you guys in season 2!

584,ah that was refreshing.
585,I cried almost in every episode. This was no exception. GIB S2 RIGHT NOW!
586,That was great. I’m kind of speechless — ready for season 2!
587,"This show is definitely up there for my favorite of the year, and while I hate to see it leading up to the “climax”  or stone wars, I can’t wait to see what’s next. Props to studio TMS for a great adaptation!"
588,"holy shit, what a way to end off the first season. soo good"
589,"Damn, I was really thrown off seeing a Switch and Goku in that montage"
590,That season 2 announcement got me hyped. 2020 would be great but honestly I'm fine with anything  this was a really great adaptation.
591,"I loved how season 1 is over, come season 2"
592,Can every one share with us what he learnt from this anime ?
593,"Ginro best wingman. Going to miss the show. That goku cameo though.

Loved each and every character the back and forth between senku, gen, chrome and other characters."
594,One of my favourite things about this show is how Byakuya and Senku have a really heart warming father-son relationship. I'm really excited for season 2!
595,"This episode is so beautiful ! This anime really is one of the best for this year. So now I'll wait for : 

Season 2 ! Season 2 ! Season 2 !!!!!!!

:)"
596,"This is one of my personal favourites from this year, Senku's journey of starting in the stone world from zero to all the steps he's taken to get this far was just fun, endearing and inspiring. The character's really sold it for me, it has one of the most diverse and colourful casts which I can't get enough of, I'm seriously gonna miss it until season 2 comes, thank you to all the staff that made it possible! And to Boichi and Inagaki for creating such an amazing story!

Also gen is the cutest and best baby boi fight me"
597,"Damn, of all episodes to end the anime.

I'm looking forward to S2, when the villages are like: ""wait, science has cure for diseases, copper stoves, and ramen, and you guys want to live in *caves*? What. The. Fuck???""

I'm guessing when the cavemen start getting sick they'll realize the value of science, but since they were unpetrified not long ago, reality hasn't happened yet.

It would be ironic if Tsukasa got sick and died off from pneumonia or something."
598,"... did Byakuya make Mayuri's ""Tuturu"" sound?

I think that's the first time I've heard that outside Steins;Gate."
599,"I'm going to miss you OP 2 :( 

This anime did very little wrong and was super satisfying til the end. Being one of the most anticipated anime this year I don't feel at all disappointed. It 1000000000% reached my expectations.  I loved it and can't wait for season 2. 

I'll probably hold off on the manga for this one tho since S2 is already coming. So excited for the Stone Wars.  


8/10"
600,try reading from chapter 1. The art itself is worth the read. Also there is a scene not adapter in the anime
601,One of the best shows ever hands down
602,You can't touch music but music can touch you.
603,"what an amazing ride for this season, i swear. An amazing finale and looking forward to the next one 12/10

&#x200B;

edit: hella lit lmao, these californian cavemen"
604,who was the person that did the singing for Lillian this episode?
605,"Song Performed by Laura Pitt-Pulford    
There's 3 tracks:  
1) Trash is treasure  
2) won't give up  
3) one small step"
606,"Other shows: Read the manga

Dr. Stone: Imagine if you guys could read manga"
607,This for me is definitely in my top 5 for anime of the year 2019. This episode was a great way to wrap things up and to prepare for S2. Loved the song as well
608,"How did Ginro know the exact speed to play the record back at?

Anyway, S1 is good stuff, 8.5/10, might've been my AOTS if not for Chihayafuru S3 and possibly Bookworm which is really picking up in later episodes."
609,"# YEAH, SCIENCE BITCH!"
610,"I swear, more I think, the harder it becomes to pick a AOTY. 

Neverland, Kaguya-sama, Fruits Basket, Hitoribocchi, Sarazanmai, AoT, Maidens in Savage Season, and now this. And this is without counting Vinland Saga (I would've included Chihayafuru but it finishes S3 next year, so it wouldn't be fair)."
611,">Forgetting Mob

dude."
612,This one is definitely a classic. I am pretty sure Dr. Stone is an anime that will be remembered even after decades. One of the best animes ever. Masterpiece. 10/10
613,hope they fix some janky animations for the blueray version
614,"You know it was only last week that I made the connection that the bagpipes in the title card sounds exactly like ""Shipping up to Boston"" from the Dropkick Murphy's, and that's why it was so familiar."
615,"my god, I can't come up with words to describe how much I loved Dr. Stone. An easy 10/10 in my book and I can't wait for that 2nd season."
616,"I've been binging the show just to catch up for the finale and it was so so so worth it.

Senkus father keeping his promise to Lillian to share her singing with senku was a beautiful way to kinda close of this season. Definitely AOTS for me. Even in this second cour in a different season. It was just such a fun show to watch, the characters are amazing, the science is fun but not overbearing. Perfect. The show definitely abandons Taiju and Yuzuriha for 75% of it but that was definitely the right choice. 

SEASON 2 ALSO CONFIRMED ~~AGAIN~~ YES! It only made sense but I'm glad it's so."
617,"Damn I love the idea of that glass recording surviving    
Byaku keeping the spirit of [Lo-Fi music](https://i.imgur.com/YTalrw4.jpg) alive    
   
On an serious note, reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is mind blowing    
Basically the diary of an roman emporer and seeing how he had to combat similiar issues 2000 years ago is mind boggling. Just imagine being able to hear recordings after 1000 of years     
   
Super hyped for the next season, really hope they can keep up this fantastic quality!"
618,"I really love this sense of being connected to people from such a distant past.

I think the work of art that had me most moved in my life was something I saw in a town near Pompeii. Inside a Roman villa, on the wall, there was a tiny, beautifully preserved fresco of a small bird. Just that, a bird, lovingly drawn in great detail. It suddenly made me really feel how there had been a hand behind it, a living person who drew it, thinking who knows what, who saw a bird and just jotted its image down that way, the same way anyone today could. Because it was such a small thing, and I could look at it from so close, it felt far more intimate and personal than any of the bigger paintings. I think if I ever got to see in person the paintings at Lascaux cave or such I'd feel something like that even stronger, through an even bigger abyss of time."
619,Aight byakuya gets best dad of anime hands down
620,"This show gives me so much optimism and it pushed me through some shitty days in the past weeks.


It really paints the picture of how far we’ve come. Even tho there are disputes in the world, when people work together they are capable of great things.


Also. Can any manga readers tell me if the stakes get higher in the next season? No spoiler please. I mean as in: does anyone die, get killed? It’s supposed to be a war and I’m really curios whether they are gonna show it’s consequences."
621,">  Can any manga readers tell me if the stakes get higher in the next season?

The stakes do become higher with every passing arc."
622,"I'll keep the answer in spoilers for those who don't want to know this: [spoiler](/s ""not really, or not much. There's danger but don't expect the show to suddenly go super dark. There is, however, one major tearjerker moment."")"
623,it gave me another thing to lookup to for the end of the week. Going home and relaxing to the latest episode
624,"I'm really glad that they just ended it simply with ""Season 2 Confirmed!"" thats all I can really ask of a series that I enjoy. Like anything else, it doesn't matter how long I have to wait, just to know that there will be a second season is enough for me"
625,This show has been making me fall in love with a lot of the small things I've taken for granted.
626,"I don't know what to expect when i started this series but some where along the way i got hella invested. Cant wait for season 2 of ""How its Made: the anime"""
627,Read the manga!!
628,"That was such an amazing way to finish the season.

If Senku could wait thousands of years just counting the time, I think we can wait a few months or years for S2."
629,"THis was a classy ending, im up to date with the manga and im wondering where they will stop next.."
630,I feel like if they had another 24 episodes they might be able to catch up with the manga. Either that or start doing 12 ep seasons.
631,I dont think they would manage to reach the current manga arc within 24. Unless they end the stone wars in 6 episodes and use the next 18 for the other bigger arc.
632,"I don't know, I guess maybe the current arc is longer than I give it credit for, it could maybe be 24 on its own."
633,A 12 episode season 2 should be enough to finish the arc
634,I will definitely enjoy science if Senku was my teacher
635,Can’t wait for S2!!
636,"Even when they make a second unit, there’s 

- Finding T&Y
- Being able to hide the unit
- Getting useful information 

Those last two kinda makes the idea a nonstarter."
637,Start on chapter 60
638,Does anyone know where to continue with the manga after episode 24?
639,"Read it from the start, it's worth it. Otherwise middle of ch 60"
640,"Ah what a great series.
Looking forward to that rocky season 2
[](https://i.imgur.com/w3w9u5Y.png)"
641,"Man idk about anyone else but seeing that Goku cameo had me rewinding back to see it again.
THAT SHIT WAS CRAZY. Even if it was just half a second. I was somewhat understanding the first couple of references but then they showed the switch and Goku and me and my roommate were just like YOOOOOO"
642,"Dr. stone knocks it out with the reward of progress,  They didn't rush things and made every bit sized victory feel great. Definitely One of if not the best of the year."
643,"Going to get dehydrated from crying every other day from this season's anime. Tugging on my heart strings and wringing it out.

What a lovely ending. I never thought that every single scene in the opening was foreshadowing something that'll actually happen.

Hands down one of my favourite anime's to date. I cannot wait until Season 2 comes!"
644,Isn't season 2 in 2 days?
645,what chapter does the manga pick up after this season. i wanna read it now
646,The anime ends in the middle of chapter 60.
647,"Why did I spend this entire episode crying? I am going to miss this show so much while it's away. Seriously considering picking up the manga, because I don't know if I can wait for season 2."
648,The anime ends in the middle of chapter 60
649,"As soon as the series finale ends, i instantly went to read the manga.

god damn it, the stone war arc is amazing.

definitely can't wait for season 2"
650,Legendary anime and episode
651,"I don’t think it has been perfect, but I honestly do think this show is one of the most important in recent memory in terms of its messaging. Lilian’s amazing song (sorta janky lyrics notwithstanding) encapsulates it perfectly - Dr Stone is an ode to science, human ingenuity and the human spirit. That’s pretty damn special."
652,"Such a spectacular way of ending a season. This is the first time I've fallen in love with a series that I had to rewatch every episode 3 times. (Once for the episode itself, then the other two for the reactions).

P.S. I just hope that Mark Rober would see this anime. This show/series reminds me of how he makes people interested with Science."
653,"So, was this good? I had to drop it about ep.3 when it turned out it will be ""stupid highschool-level chemistry turned into plot devices, for weebs"". Did it ever do anything else?"
654,It started to pick up at episoe 6. Its a science centric shonen
655,This episode had me crying like a baby and I'm crying even more since I just realised it's the season finale.
656,"Best anime of the year in my opinion

This finale was just so beautiful.

Season 2 here we come!"
657,"I'm really surprised by all the love for this show. My instinct after the first few episodes was that narratively the show wasn't really going anywhere and that it would be best to binge it at the end of the season but I got talked into watching every week and I have to say I may be alone or mostly alone here but I was indeed pretty disappointed by how little progress the show made. It focused so much on getting the science and such right that it really didn't get very far in actual storytelling. Senku is largely in the same position he was when he arrived at the village. Yes he has a single cell phone now. Great. And a record. Awesome. But he also spent the entire season puffing up this big conflict to come and it never delivered. That to me is not a great show and while it's bingeworthy I don't get all the love and excitement for it. There were much better, much more satisfying shows this year."
658,">how little progress the show made. It focused so much on getting the science and such right that it really didn't get very far in actual storytelling.

Firstly the main point of the show is the science and the wonder of how amazing it is and what humans actually accomplished which is what makes the show great. As for the progress of the story it was perfectly fine, if we break it down into sections you can clearly see it:

1) Senku wakes up and has to basically learn to survive in this new world and try to workout what actually happened with the petrification (which is ultimately the end game) 

2) Senku then comes into conflict with Tsukasa which is really the set up for the war arc coming in season 2 

3) He meets Kohaku then gets to the village and has to earn the villagers trust 

4) Earns the trust of the villagers, becomes leader and is now preparing for the war coming in season 2 

5) As a side story partly learn about his ""dad's"" time thousands of years before he woke up at the start


I think ultimately if you don't love the science of the show sadly the show probably isn't for you (which is perfectly fine), the big bad is not the main focal point of a show like this, unlike say Demon Slayer."
659,I do love the science though. It's my favorite part. It's the slow progress of the story and science and the contrivances that I found so disappointing.
660,Fair enough
661,"At the very end the OST sounds like a famous song but I can’t wrap my head and remember, anyone care to help?"
662,this was a good anime. i like the comedy more than the scientific part. tsuika's slang is so satisfying somehow. will watch the second one for sure
663,Yo what was that rap song??? When Senku's dad was fucking around with the electric razor
664,"OST ""My team is amazing"""
665,Crying in school right now
666,"Truly amazing, a very good contender for AOTY. I don't think anything can really come close to it in any way except for Attack on Titan.

That ending left me somewhat speechless. I can't Wait for season 2 so I'm gonna read the manga lmao"
667,"The Promised Neverland, Mob Psycho 100 S2, Demon Slayer, Vinland Saga, Dr. Stone, AOT S3 PT 2. Idc who wins, this year has just been amazing for anime fans."
668,"It's really hard to choose, isn't it? Lmao"
669,Kaguya sama
670,tpn was disappointing
671,"I guess it depends on what you want. It was the best show of 2019 for me. I really wish there were more shows like this. 

I love Vinland, AoT, and Kimetsu no Yaiba as well, but anime where there’s conflict and strategy involved with outwitting your opponent is the sort of shit I love."
672,"Same, plus the animation and music were great, so much tension in each episode and a huge cliffhanger, what kind of world is outside those walls? Can't wait for S2."
673,"Absolutely. I want to know so bad that I almost picked up the manga, but there’s no way it will stir the same feelings that the anime did with the music and animation and “camera work” (for lack of a better term)."
674,Vinland saga?
675,If I want to pick up via the manga from where the anime left off which chapter/vol do I start with?
676,60
677,"Phone aquired! next Senku has to invest the next best thing, Pizza delivery."
678,Man i really can't wait to read the manga from chapter 1 and be back for season 2.
679,Im so glad that i started watching this series. Now its time to watch the manga and see if certain rumours are true
680,So fucking hyped. Best episode yet.
681,"[A good 'ol song from the dead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-8H3gE9dUo)

I thought this show was only 'watchable' in the first half as well as the tournament arc, but this second half with building the phone was actually really cool.  This series is really great with its problem solving, especially with how well it keeps you engaged with how well-explained everything is.  This upcoming battle with Tsukasa seems very action-heavy, so I hope there will be a good blend of that problem-solving mixed in."

685,I hope we see Professor Rock and Mr.Mineral next season.
686,Until then you can check out [Professor Elemental ](https://youtu.be/0iRTB-FTMdk) and his chap-hop beats.
687,"Jeez even Ayla wanted him to confess his feelings to her sister. What's that say about what she thinks of the two of them?


A glass record huh. Gotta admit that's pretty cool. And if there was ever a rallying cry needed to inspire the people of the village to defeat the Empire and bring back the modern age, that song was it.


It's nice to see that Yuzuriha still has her kryptonite head thing.


But with the Stone Wars having to wait till next season it leaves one to wonder just what other kinds of scientific marvels Senku will have up his sleeve to fight this war of sticks and stones."
688,"Imagine if corpsegrinder was on that spaceship instead of Lillian. 

But anyway this was such a good show, even managed to get my friend back into anime with it. I'm so excited to see how this war pans out, wondering if people will die. My thoughts are all scattered, I just know I love the author who wrote this. They now have 2 series in my favorites list."
689,Okay seriously who the hell is cutting onions in here!!!??? Another great episode!
690,"An ultimate swan song of an episode.

&#x200B;

such a godly new shounen anime, best one in years. 10 billion perfect have to start reading the manga now"
691,"Stone Wars Season 2: The empire strikes back

I can't wait and I'm sad that I have to."
692,Damn the feels
693,"[FeelsStrongMan](https://i.imgur.com/6n8fog9.png)

[Dragon Ball Z](https://i.imgur.com/ta2dncp.jpg) is coming back!

Another teary ep. [I can't wait for the next season](https://i.imgur.com/Qq5wWO5.jpg).

I really loved the slow pace, where you could see all the hard work put into creating things. I found it to be perfect for this type of anime."
694,I'm 10 BILLION percent reading the manga now!
695,Yare Yare Daze...
696,"We've been in that village so long that I actually kind of forgot that humanity was still alive in the stone. When he said, ""And I'm gonna show it all to you"" I thought it was cool"
697,It was a 9/10 due to some jokes not really landing for me but the finale and the recorder brought it to a 10/10. idfc. time to binge the mango
698,"Damn, a cute ass last episode! The record was a nice surprise.

Glad we got to see Taiju and Yuzuriha again! (Although Taiju is a little annoying)

I can't wait for season 2! My ship is real with Senkuu and Kohaku (had a nice moment at the end).

I hope the pink haired girl who liked the cotton candy joins them!"
699,Hopefully we don’t have to wait too long for season 2
700,"Thank God for the second season because it would be very evil to finish the series on this point.

Happy to see Byakuya's group again but at the same time sad knowing what their destiny was.

The song made me tear up, it was such a strong moment. And I really thought [the girl singing in the OP was Ruri but it turned out to be Lillian](https://i.imgur.com/yIuA4VG.png)......... Which I have to say makes it very clear where [Ruri's genes](https://i.imgur.com/RwlRiJW.png) come from  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Although I don't think I liked it as much as others, it was a very fun show that got better once Senku met Kohaku.

**Kohaku best girl.**"
701,"> The song made me tear up, it was such a strong moment. And I really thought the girl singing at the OP was Ruri but it turned out to be Lillian......... Which I have to say makes it very clear where Ruri's genes come from ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Damn Ruri..."
702,that amazing birthing hips
703,"This is the first time senku talks about how science can be used for our entertainment, not just for practical situations, and for solving problems. His father reminded him about this, and I loved it"
704,Is this the final episode of the season? Or will there be more ?
705,That was such a poignant yet fitting ending to this first season. I got chills when it dawned on me that Senku's dad technically couldn't have known if Senku did receive his message in the future which goes to show how much faith he had in him. Certainly one of the best anime dads I have seen in a while.
706,"Well, this ended nicely.

I didn't expect the record, though I did connect the dots with the bee's needle and name faster than the characters. Magma were a nice touch, too - you wanted Senku to keep showing you something cool? A song from thousands years ago, that cool enough? I'm also enjoying Gen much more than I thought I would.

Overall I enjoyed the show. Not a full 9/10 for me personally (but still very much at the top of this year), since I was just about ready to completely drop it before they separated Senku from Taiju, as his constant shouting was extremely annoying for me. What can I say, I like my peace and quiet. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I'm really glad some of you guys convinced me to continue watching it. Thanks again."
707,"I hope i wasn't the only one who started crying when Senku got to hear his dad's voice for the first time in thousands of years. 

God damn this is one of the best shows i have ever watched."
708,"It was only 2~3 years, from Senku's perspective."
709,"[Dammit, Chrome!](https://imgur.com/7l68YTR.png) You had ONE job!!!"
710,"I really enjoyed the season, especially when Senku discovered the Ishigami village, the story really became interesting. I love the cast. Can't wait to see them defeat Tsukasa kingdom soon(-ish)!"
711,"Told my friend to watch Dr. Stone, she got about 2 episodes in and abandoned it. Her loss."
712,bribe her with cola and ramen
713,A good friend gets people to watch until at least Chrome shows up.
714,Ok the anime is over where do I follow off from in the manga
715,I believe this episode covered chapters 59 and 60. So start with 61.
716,half of 60
717,"I'm not crying, you're crying!"
718,"Whew. I was nearly moved to tears by that record! This was one hell of a high note to end on. :D

Looking forward to season 2, but now I'm trying to work out if I can wait or if I'll just read the manga like I did for the Promised Neverland..."
719,I'd say wait out and re-read the manga up until this point meanwhile. The wait will be worth it.
720,"That was a great final episode for Season 1. Really nice to see Byakuya and his crew again through a series of flashbacks as we see them improvising a record player along with how Senku tries to make a playback record player of his own.

We got another vocal performance by Lilian too!

Guess I'm looking forward to seeing how the rest of this plays out in Season 2. See you whenever the date gets finalized."
721,Anyone know the name of the rap that was in the background before they got the record to play?
722,"Yea, My Teams Amazing!!"
723,"Not sure if anyone pointed it out but the glass record was in the opening this whole time. 

Byakuya truly best boy/dad of 2019"
724,shit's about to go down man. My only quibble about this anime was the somewhat faulty animation/perspectives but it was a phenomenal concept otherwise. When's the next season gonna be released? Any info yet?
725,Can someone tell me where this ends in the manga?
726,"Middle of chapter 60, reread it and move on from there."
727,I did not expect this to be the anime that made me cry but I’m not complaining. It’s been a ride. I can’t wait for S2!
728,"this was an amazing finale for a dope show! already catching up on the manga, this series has me hooked haha"
729,"man, even though I was well aware that Season 2 was already confirmed, it was still 10 billion percent hype to see that teaser at the end. I can't fucking wait

[](#hypeoverload)"
730,"Godamn, loved this season. Anyone know where the Anime left off in the Manga and if it’s worth reading? 9.5/10"
731,Reread chapter 60. The anime stopped in the middle of it.
732,K ty man
733,i really hope next season takes us past the stone wars arc. i need my best boi
734,"If there was ever a time it was okay to stop being stubborn and say ""I love you"" then recording it on a hidden record and sending it thousands of years into the future was it.

I isn't care if ""they know"" Say the words!"
735,Senkuu would consider it lame. Byakuya knows his boy all too well.
736,"Okay hear me out now what if Senku isn't going to war with weapons, but with words and music and media and creating an empire of influence."
737,So basically he's going for the culture victory
738,And yet everyone on here seems to want him to go full-Ghandi and nuke the place.
739,Then what's the difference between him and Tsukasa
740,"I'm not saying he should, just that seems to be the /r/anime culture."
741,Personally I'd like to see Senku convert even Tsukasa to his side. I want him to win that culture victory lol.
742,"This is an excellent finale episode. I'm re-watching through the show with my sister, and it's been great seeing her reactions (we just saw Byakuya's Space Adventures). She keeps asking my why I torture her with shows that make her cry, I was going to watch Vinland Saga or maybe get back on Attack on Titan but now I am halfway tempted to choose a run of the mill isekai story because she's been having it too good for too long."
743,i wish i had a sister who also enjoys manga and anime . Good for you two
744,"THIS SERIES IS AMAZING GOD THIS SEASON WAS HEAVEN TO MY WEEBO SELF AH! VINLAND, DR.STONE, FIRE FORCE AND BABYLONIA HAVE ALL BEEN SO GOOOOOOD!"
745,did they change the voice of taiju?
746,[deleted]
747,"she is an American idol who learned Japanese, she sings in English"
748,"It's implied that the village speaks a creole language derived from both english and japanese, so they might understand some of it.

Besides, the message was meant for Senku, who definitely speaks english."
749,that was beautiful
750,Senku’s dad was playing some hardcore 4D chess in order to get that message to Senku.
751,Now to War!!!
752,My God this show man. How exhilarating.
753,"Over the last few eps.,the odds seem to be getting more & more against Tsukasa.So it was nice to see Tsukasa's folks discovering that Taiju & Yuzuriha are spies.They will have some leverage now.It'll make for a much more interesting fight."
754,I thought he knew the entire time and just didn't care?
755,"This show makes me cry, smile and gasp every week.

Truly was a great anime this season.

CAN'T WAIT FOR S2."
756,"Amazing 9.5/10. I just feel that for 24 episodes we could've had a bit of the Stone Wars, just to have a taste and see more of Yuzuriha ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)."
757,the ed made me cry at least 5 times
758,What chapter of the manga can I pick this up on after this season?
759,The anime ended in the middle of chapter 60.
760,Thanks!
761,"The Stone Wars
My brain went to Tsukasa and Senku throwing rocks at each other"
762,I was to close to dropping this show. I remember I didn't really like it when it first came out but decided to stick it out for a few episodes because I really liked the premise. Now after 24 episodes I can safely say I'm so glad I did. Can't wait for season 2!
763,"How can you make a glass record? I understand a basic record since it is soft. But glass is hard. How do you make record out of it?

Beautiful ep/finale of s1."
764,"> But glass is hard. How do you make record out of it?

As explained in the episode - you just have to use something harder than glass, like diamond."
765,But the mechanism? I can understand the method. You speak and needle vibrates. I doupt just vibration of a diamond is enough to make a record.
766,That's what is brilliant about it - it's that simple.
767,"I think you would need stronger sound waves than a wax recorder, so you might need an amplifier or something, but I think they had the electronics-bits available to make one. 

I'm no audio engineer, but what little I do know of primitive recording devices, the trick would be that the write head would need to be heavier, and thus take stronger pressure to ""bounce,"" but I think amped up sound waves could do that, essentially taking a normal singing voice and making it ""sound"" like a rock concert as it vibrates the write head."
768,Maybe.
769,Fun fact you can also [turn a Speaker into a Microphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqzMuq3EzSk).
770,Real life macgyver.
771,JBA: Diamond is unbreakable
772,But is glass soft enough to be drawn up n with a needle of diamond?
773,Someone needs to do an actual glass record on youtube
774,Season 2!!! There really is a Jebus Crunch!
775,Sadness on my mind
776,"Amazing series!! I couldn't help but tear up a little seeing Byakuy speaking to Senku. Great final episode. Can't wait to see season 2.

EDIT: OH SHIT YUZURIHA AND TAIJU THE HYPE!!"
777,"Man I really liked this anime and Senku has to be one my favorite shonen protagonists. This anime is just different, I’ve never seen an anime similar to this one and I’m hypedd for the next season. HELLA LIT"
778,"Second season announced, I'm happy!"
779,"My favorite anime this year, but I really hope some money is put into the animation next season. That was this show's weakest point."
780,"After finishing this last episode, I want to start reading where the anime finished. What chapter should I start on, and would I be missing anything from beforehand?"
781,You'd miss on the great art and minor details. Start with chapter 60.it was not fully adapted.
782,Thanks so much 👍👍👍
783,"quite fateful adaptation and with high quality work, i'm pleased that one of the best current WSJ manga got this kind of adaptation, my only hope is that S2 not only covers the stone wars but also the ""downtime arc"" after it and before the current manga arc."
784,"Well that was a pretty good anime. Solid 7/10, I'm looking forward to S2! 

The good: It was so rewarding to see how Senku would keep advancing the village, it always kept me hooked and it's always been the first anime I watched on Fridays.

The bad: I have to say that having an anime about science but having obviously superhuman characters (Senku and Tsukasa) kinda breaks my suspension of disbelief. Also I don't like how Senku knows literally everything, but sometimes conveniently doesn't know obvious stuff when the plot requires it. I'd also say that, overall, he's a bit too OP."
785,i believe each character is OP in their own respective fields like Kaseki. But they still need to work together to achieve their goals.
786,"For a show focused on hard brainy science, Dr Stone sure got a lot of heart in it."
787,What an amazing adaptation TMS did for the whole season. If only many other series got this kind of treatment as well. Can’t wait to see how Season 2 turns out!
788,"#BYUKA YOU FUCKING HERO  

[](#takaradasalute)  

Voices over infinate Distance, oh man.  

Lol of course they need 2 phones hahaha.  Or could just analog it with a cable!  Good plan!  

Wow Kinro Ginro thinking of historic first words hahahaha.  I wonder how he knows that?  

Speaker?  Wait she knkowws about speaker?  What?  Huh?  

One of the Hunbred Tales?  Speaker Bee?  hahhaa.  Gravestone?  Wait... wait... dads grave?  

OH SHIT DONT TELL ME DAD LEFT SOMETHING ELSE BEHIND!?  

TIME CAPSULE!? DAD YOU CRAZY GENUIS!  

ITS A RECORD ISNT IT!?  HOLY SHIT!  

So can we make a record player?  

FLASHBACK TIME! AW YEAH!!  EVERYONE IS STILL ALIVE TOO!  

Oh man big lips used her wedding ring to help with the record reorder?  

That flash back of Dad and crew building just like Senkku and friends do.  

IT WORKKS! OH SHIT  HIS DAD KNEW EXACTLY WHO FOUND THIS!  

OH SHIT DAD GOT TO LET SENKU HEAR DIVAS <MUSICC LIKE HE WANTED! OH MAN THATS TOO MUCH!  

Oh man that was too great to hear...  WHat a fucking hero Senku's Dadd was.  

Man what a hell of a way to hype everyone up!  

Senku is a man of his word, if he says it,it will happen.  

GEORGE AND MOE-CHAN! ITS BEEN SO LONG TO HEAR YOU AGAIN YESSS!!  

Of course the hussie heard them... shit...  and Tarzan is ready to go.  

STONE WARS!!  SEASON 2 CONFIRMED~  AW YEAH!  

Man what a fucking amazing ending to the first season.  I always wondered what that Diva scene in the OP ment, i thought it had to do with the phone, but it was the message from the past instead, so good.  I cant wait to see the future of this story!"
789,"Actually gave me chills, brilliant episode"
790,I'm surprised Ginro tried to help Chrome confess to Ruri. I thought he was gonna do that thing where your mom calls you & all your friends start moaning sexually & talking about how good the weed they're smoking is.
791,"4K upvotes wow, this series was really a pleasant surprise for me this year. I remember commenting on the CR facebook page when they were promoting it having no idea what it was about and finding the title weird. No one ever replied to me, so I decided to jump in and give it a watch and man am I glad, it's been an amazing 24 weeks and I'm sad that it's over. Legit had tears in my eyes the whole episode. Such a really fresh take that I haven't felt since Log Horizon. Amazing show, amazing year of anime. See you all in Winter. Can't wait to see Stone Wars animated."
792,"Such a great series, I love how impactful they make each episode feel."
793,"I do recommend everyone read the manga, it only gets better from the intro arc and indeed where it's up to now"
794,A fantastic finale for a fantastic show. It's so rare that an *unfinished* show leaves me so satisfied when it ends. Actually I can't even think of a previous instance of feeling like this
795,"I don't know if I'd say Dr Stone was the best anime of 2019, but it was my favorite viewing experience of 2019. Just an all around fun time."
796,Cue my manga binge of this series now in 3..2..1..
797,"I’m not crying, you’re crying"
798,"That was exhilarating!, 10 billion percent!"
799,Did Senku's dad put the location of the village on the coast for it to be spotted the easiest? Coastal navigation is easier then land exploration.
800,"I think they teased the impending battle way too much. As the final episodes were airing it was kind of a slow let-down to know nothing would be resolved and it's gonna take a whole other season to get to the events that have been teased for more than half this season. I'm glad for a 2nd season, but I feel like nothing was really resolved this season. 2nd season is going to be them talking about this battle coming up again but we aren't going to see it for another 20 episodes of S2. I haven't read the manga but that's just my guess. I like this anime but it kind of felt like a slog for most of the later episodes and I found myself wanting to skip parts of episodes."
801,The best way i can describe this show is that it makes the viewer proud to he a human. Can’t wait for season 2!
802,I’m hooked boys! Where do I start the Manga from here??
803,"this show surprised me, really enjoyed this from start to finish sans the tsukasa stuff. also yay for taiju and yuzuriha appearance, can't wait for season 2!"
804,Guys what chapter do I start reading that picks up where the anime ends?
805,"No need, season 2 comes this week. Like Black Clover, they're doing Continous Streaming"
806,I'd still like to know think I'll just read the manga from now on.
807,That Goku cameo
808,"Why didn't Senku just make guns and explosives?

These weapons require fewer components, are less complex, provide crushing offense and defense, and could be completed in half the time.

The remaining time would then be used to improve the technology of the village."
809,The episodes with his father are the worst cause I cant get over how fucking stupid him being an astronaut creating the village and not being his real father is.
810,"Hearing the song, I understood how Senku felt when eating the primitive ramen. Everyone there loved it, but all I felt was cringe."
811,"Not that interesting of an episode, but the confirmation of a season 2 sure was nice."
812,Do you think Senku will create Nezuko in Stone World?
813,"One of the few shows I genuinely disliked and finished. 

Don't get me wrong the plot is nice. But the fact the MC knows literally everything about anything yet cannot reason with the antagonist? The show tries to be serious but then throws in stupid non serious faces literally five seconds after?"
814,"The said antagonist is highly biased because of a childhood trauma and refuse to accept anything different from his point of view + is a fighting monster, try to argue with him, sure.

The show never try to be serious, aside from some scene with tsukasa plotline it's all game and fun montage sessions and crafting, they have the right to goof around, so wtf are you talking about ?"
815,Same i ended up rating it 2/10. Basically just watching for completion after a certain point. Though I have to say that this finale was actually decent compared to how trash a lot of the show has been
816,"This show wasn't that great. It's very reliant on montages and it gets very repetitive because you know there will be hardly any set backs or failures for these really complex creations. Senku just goes HE HE HE and then Mary Sue's his way through the science. He's basically a God.

Writing wise, there are some weird decisions like why prioritize a cell phone over weapons? How does Senku know for sure that they won't attack or harass them during winter? I know they're bluffing having guns but wouldn't tsukasa at least scout to keep tabs? Also when Tsukasa initially fought Senku he could have easily died had Tsukasa hit literally anything else besides his neck. There's just so many bad assumptions that just work out perfectly through out the story. It's really baffling, I haven't seen anyone ask these questions."
817,">why prioritize a cell phone over weapons

Technically it's more like a series of radio towers, and one of the main themes involves how everything is linked together. In order to create parts of the tower, he managed to also introduce indoor heating and cooking to the village. The entire reason they made cotton candy was so that they could test their thread spinner on something that was not as valuable and limited as gold. 

As far as not making weapons first...they don't need to. They already have the technology and materials to make swords. They lack crucial things for firearms (that being gunpowder) and even if they had it, Tsukasa's army is strong enough and more numerous to easily defeat the village in a straight up fight. In any sort of war, communication is key. The invasion of Normandy was a success BECAUSE they used communication to misdirect the Nazi army on which beach they were going to attack. If you have better communication and coordination than your opponent, numbers become meaningless and you can just exploit weaknesses as you find them.

It honestly sounds like you didn't watch or pay attention to anything that was explained, despite it being done in such a way that kids could understand it.

As far as ""oh, Senku could have died if Tsukasa hit anywhere else"" just...shut up. This is a shonen and contrivances like that are not a rarity. Want something more realistic? Go watch Monster or Vinland Saga."
818,"You're able to make up all sorts of excuses when the writing is bad but when it's egregious, ""it's okay because it's a shonen"". Senku is just a self insert OP isekai protagonist who fulfills the child's power fantasy. He never grows or changes or improves because he's already perfect. Boring as f bro."
819,"Like I said, it doesn't seem you're familiar with shonen. This is kind of how things are written. The heroes hardly ever grow emotionally. The people around them show a ton of growth based on their actions, but most shonen protatonists are one trick ponies with personalities as deep as a drink saucer. It's fairly common with Germanic heroes that they just simply do not grow or at least are not deterred from their overall goals because the story is about how they overcome challenges, not how they get informed through new experiences.

Let me name a few:

Goku doesn't grow at all from the original Dragon Ball. His entire character is that he just likes fighting and protects things which are important to him, but more importantly that he likes fighting. If there's a fight to be had, he'll be in it.

Luffy, similarly, just goes on his adventure from place to place to experience new and fun things. He doesn't grow as a person from doing any of this. 

Jotaro Kujo has no personality to speak of yet is beloved.

Probably one of my most controversial takes on this type of hero, though, is Eren Yaeger. I have no idea why the anime community in general has such a hardon for this angry plank of wood. His entire existence is defined by him being angry. That's it. 

So, what makes Senku any different from any of these other guys? Shonen heroes all tend to be very flat characters that are meant to overcome unique challenges put before them by the story, not characters who grow. If you want to look at a character to root for that ISN'T a walking plot device, you have Chrome.

With regards to plot contrivances, they happen in literally every thing that exists. There are plenty of times where the hero can be easily subdued but isn't, and if you think too hard you end up being a nitpicking little shit who can't find enjoyment in anything. Why didn't Frieza kill Goku first before he could get angry enough to go Super Saiyan? Why didn't DIO just stop time and rip out Jotaro's heart? WHY DIDN'T KYON JUST FUCK HARUHI GODDAMN

As I said before, Dr. Stone is not that kind of story to delve into realistic implications of interpersonal actions and instead focuses on how scientific discovery is all connected and how it's taken for granted in a world where such a thing is ubiquitous. Having Tsukasa just kill Senku, the story would end right there...but they used that event to create an opportunity to show how the stone transformation has restorative properties, inserting a its own fictional science as a plot device to go along with the theming of...scientific discovery. 

The writing is fine, you just have no idea how logistics and priorities work in the stone world. ""WHY NOT WEAPONS"" was addressed in the show itself, you dingus. They don't have access to the ingredients for gunpowder at all and they already can make fine weapons with what they have already and at a very quick rate. Going by anime time, it would probably take Kaseki only a few days to make a full armory, when compared to the several month long project of creating radio towers for communication on the battlefield. Again: DID YOU EVEN WATCH THE SHOW."
820,"I don't get how is Senku a 'mary Sue' 

Remember wwII with Nazis in Russia winter ?

Tsukasa highly respected Senku therefore choose to kill him the less painful way

Anyway thanks for your feedback speedwatcher-kun"
821,Feels sad man :( i wish they made the scene more emotional
822,"Oh man, it’s been like 15 episodes and Tanjiro finally got some speaking lines lmao"
