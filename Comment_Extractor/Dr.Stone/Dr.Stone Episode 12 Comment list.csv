1,"Ginrou has quite a few ""turns around and does the right/courageous thing"" moments. You'd think he'd have a braver personality by now."
2,He's definitely gotten braver overall. It's just that he goes from an absolute scaredy cat to somewhat normal.
3,"It's pretty natural for people to default to their first instincts and then overcome them. His first instinct is terror, and then he pushed through, which is what makes him brave."
4,[Anime Sulfy](https://i.imgur.com/xmjmL8S.png) Just isn't as metal as she is in [the manga](https://i.imgur.com/6Boj3QI.png)
5,So the skin falls off everywhere except for the big chesto. Okay.
6,It's Boichi. If she doesn't have big boobs and isn't breaking her back she's not a woman or a female representation of a natural phenomena I guess.
7,"For those who finally break down and wish to read the manga, this episode covered up to ch. 32."

10,I really want Senku to help Kinro already :(
11,Fr how does he not know about the watermelon glasses already
12,Because plot needs to build it into a bigger story problem first
13,"I wouldn't phrase it so negatively like that. It's more like the eye problem wasn't a character issue for Suika. It is a character issue for Kinro. Kinro doesn't want to use science to help his eyes, because that would be making excuses and ""men don't make excuses"". This is both a nice but also dumb sentiment. On one hand, he wants to be able to be strong and useful in his own way. He doesn't want to rely on science for everything. Of course it is dumb on the other hand because it's not a excuse per se. Using science doesn't make you less strong in your own way. But he hasn't realized that yet, that's the point. Kinro has to come to the realization that he can use science like everyone else and that's ok. Think about it, everyone else in the story when presented with a solution by science has \*taken it without question\*. Cure for Ruri, glasses for Suika, better food for the village. Kinro is the \*only one\* who is declining to use science because he sees it as an excuse and wants to be strong in his own way.

It doesn't have to do with them trying to escalate a story problem or something so unnecessarily dramatic. It's trying to develop Kinro and his psychology."
14,"Nah, Kinro just straight up doesn’t know about glasses. He thinks his poor eyesight is something he has to live with, and it’s unmanly to make excuses about something you can’t change. It’s not like he wants to avoid using science, last episode he went along with Ginro’s idea to pimp their spears out so that he can judge distances better during a fight. Kohaku told Senku that they were bullshitting, and that’s why his request got rejected. 

It’s easy to forget because it’s weekly airing, but the tournament they’re preparing for is just a couple of days away. They’re on a time crunch, and everyone except Ginro has been very busy with their assigned roles."
15,"Well yes obviously he doesn’t know about the glasses. My comment is about why he doesn’t. They were stating he doesn’t know about them for the sake of making it a bigger story issue by delaying it. That’s just a simplification. The reason they haven’t had him find out about glasses yet has to do with his character.

He does want to avoid science, when confronted with the idea of asking for help about his “fuzziness” he explicitly said what I quoted, which is that men don’t make excuses. He doesn’t want to turn to science for help. The only reason he’s ok with pimping out the spears is because he’s always had a soft spot for this gold tipped spear thing. He doesn’t even like to show it though. He’s practically a tsundere about science. “Oh I don’t want that gold spear or anything.. Baka”. He is clearly trying to not use science.

That being said he’s less adamant it seems about the gold spear because it’s cosmetic. But he’s pretty adamantly against curing his fuzziness, because to him that’s not an aesthetic, it’s seen as an excuse."
16,"I think you’re misremembering that scene. Ginro never suggested asking for help with Kinro’s poor vision, because he also didn’t know about glasses. Ginro was instead suggesting that he explain to Kohaku that “it’s not his fault” that he’s getting shit on in their training, so that she can get off his back. He’s against mentioning his vision because he sees it as an excuse, not as a problem that he needs help with. 

That scene basically serves to highlight the difference in mentality of the two while also introducing the issue of Kinro’s vision. It has nothing to do with him not wanting to accept science. He’s already accepted science multiple times throughout the show. The whole reason he’s training is essentially because he believes in science to solve problems."
17,"You’re right, I’m phrasing that scene wrong. The point is he doesn’t want to bring up his problem as an excuse, even if someone can help. Science isn’t explicitly mentioned, but it’s implied given the context of the episode is fixing someone else’s vision. It’s shown that if he spoke up about it, science could fix it. But he stubbornly will not “make excuses” and won’t tell anyone. Of course he doesn’t know about the glasses, but if he so much as mentioned his problems they would tell him and help him. This is absolutely a character issue. I should better phrase it that he doesn’t just not accept science, he doesn’t accept using any inadequacies as an excuse. Which ties in with science because science in this show has been used as a means to overcome your inadequacies. Poor eye sight, disease, fragile body. Science can make up for all of it. But if you won’t even admit your inadequacy in the first place, then science can’t help you. He’s essentially rejecting the help of science. That’s my point. Not only that but he needs to learn to lean on his friends. He’s not willing to share his challenges."
18,why would he speak up if a solution doesnt exist? he doesnt know it exist. so it doesnt. it doesnt matter to him because he was born with it and nothing will change even if he told anyone.
19,"Have you always at every point in your life spoke up about a problem you’re having because you already knew the solution? I for one know that a lot of the time when I’m sharing my problems with people, it’s in hopes they have a solution I’m unaware of. His reasoning isn’t what you’re saying and we know that from what he says. He doesn’t say “I don’t wanna bring it up because nothing would change anyways”. He’s saying he doesn’t want to bring it up because it’d be an excuse and men don’t make excuses. These are very different things."
20,you should try living in the stone age.
21,What does that have to do with it. Part of the reason humanity developed to the modern day from the Stone Age is because people learned to communicate and create solutions as a group. Everyone didn’t ask for things after they knew the solution. That’s just silly
22,because you are unable to comprehend what a problem without a solution is.
23,"No, I’m just able to comprehend other people can have solutions I don’t know of, so Sharing your problems when you don’t know an answer is a natural course of action.

Did you know a distinguishing feature of humans that most other animals can’t reproduce is the knowledge that other individuals have knowledge outside what we know? Even small human children initially can’t understand another person knows or doesn’t know something they don’t know or do know. I don’t know about you, but most of us at some point developed that understanding that the person next to us can have ideas and understandings we don’t."
24,Not to mention that he having a problem in his eyes means that he is less than others and i don't think that this can be forgiven in these times.
25,Does he and his co-guard even know that Suika has similar issues?  Let alone the work Senku and Chrome did the previous week was fixing her issue?
26,"No, but the reason he won’t speak up about his problem is because he doesn’t want help. He doesn’t wanna make an excuse. He doesn’t need to know about the Suika situation to not want to bring up his problem for the sake of doing things without excuses for himself. You can basically replace where I said “use science” with “make excuses for himself”. He doesn’t want to ask for help, which in this story directly correlates to him not wanting to rely on science."
27,"He doesn't even know about the glasses to be able to reach those decisions. This forced miscommunication is dumb, it would be better if it was as you said."
28,"He doesn’t need to know about the glasses to know he doesn’t want to use his problem as an excuse. He doesn’t want to ask for help in any form. Even if science could help him, even if someone knows what’s wrong, he doesn’t care and stubbornly wants to resolve things himself. He doesn’t need to know there actually is a scientific solution to know he doesn’t want to ask."
29,"Who, Kinro? He does, he doesn't want them...he doesn't want to ask for help and seem weak and etc, it's an ego thing."
30,"Expecting it to be in the next episode, it being called ""Masked warrior"" and all"
31,Maybe once he finds out about his poor vision. It sure gets brought up enough for that to happen sooner or later.
32,Maybe Senku can invent lasik for him if he refuses glasses
33,patience and you will be satisfied
34,"Well the next episode is called ""Masked Warrior."" I hope it means what I think it means."
35,"We need more credit for the old man who made the masks, he is the real hero here for making all that perfectly glass and paraphernalia while also teaching important lessons to the youngers. Such legendary old man.  
 
[](#brofist)"
36,"""oh no, I accidentally made another one. I'll leave it right here, since I don't need it.""

Classic."
37,"""oh dear, i accidentally made an extra plot device. I'll just leave it here, since you need it for character development"""
38,Yes nothing should ever happen in stories
39,"Imagine if people criticized literally any other art form like this. 

""Look at all these colors this artist is using. What a fucking amateur.""

""I can tell you've paid a lot of attention to the song structure you fucking hack composer.""

""I can tell this guy used the rule of threes to make fun of me and he's also being all meta. What a fucking dork."""
40,This is one of the dumbest comments I’ve ever seen
41,"Kaseki is absolutely one of the most important characters in the show, and a vital member of the Kingdom of Science. This is show a bit subtly, but still shown on purpose. Science accelerates with adoption. The more people working on a problem, the more people are going to benefit and more quickly.

Senku - working alone: Manages to revive one muscle-bound guy in several months.

Senku + Taijuu: Get their hands on alcohol in a couple months, revive Tsukasa & Yuzuriha. 

Senku + Taijuu + Yuzuriha: Make gunpowder in a few days. Build the base machines and utilities that Senku then uses over and over again to benefit the villagers.

Senku + Chrome (Materials guy) + Kohaku + Suika: Gather iron sand in just a couple days. Make ramen.

Senku + ramen-paid labor from the village: smelt iron in less than a day. Make powerful magnets

Senku + Spear Brothers + others: Make fucking electricity in one evening.

Senku + others + Kaseki, the detail-work craftsman: Make a chemistry lab in a few days and then some charcoal-filter respirators to enable work with toxic gasses. Kaseki is right there along with the others, and just as important.

It just keeps getting faster and faster as it does in real life. It scales up. The manga does a wonderful job of showing this, as does the anime.

[Next episode begins](/s ""the tournament arc, and if the title is anything to go by, also ends it, a nice parodying nod to the shonen staple, but also a demonstration of the pace of science. I`d be willing to bet we know the village`s name by the end of next ep or the beginning of the ep after. --edit-- after thinking about the amount of content I`d be willing to bet that this is a two-parter that ends ep13 right on the `masked warrior` being revealed, and the name of the village being revealed at the end of ep14"")"
42,That's a really interesting observation. At this rate it may not be crazy to imagine Senku browsing reddit again before he gets old.
43,"It won’t exactly be the same, you won’t have the same comments and that. But maybe that’s more esoteric, like “you never stand in the same river twice” (because it flows past you)"
44,"As a certain chapter title says... [tiny spoiler](/s ""PEOPLE IS POWER!"")"
45,reminds me of Iroh from avatar
46,"Yeah that whole story/speech complete with the ""I'll just leave this here"" was very very Iroh and I loved every second of it. Kaiseki MVP"
47,"Kaiseki is best boy, trust me."
48,"Damn, Chrome was almost going to die there. The representation of that lake as a beautiful girl by Ginro is really accurate, because they may be deadly, [but those lakes are really pretty for sure](https://i.imgur.com/tuoO85X.jpg). Is like looking at the beach of a tropical island."
49,"Fun Fact: ""Sulfy-chan"" was rated the 15th most popular character during Dr. Stone's first popularity poll."

61,"Malty is the one that got her name changed to bitch, Melty is the younger sister."
62,Oh shit your right she is the chocobo lover

69,Lmao
70,I can't wait for the seasonal best girl contest to start...
71,What has did she represent again?
72,"> Damn, Chrome was almost going to die there

He could have potentially avoided that by not wearing shitty cone-shoes. Seriously, what were those shoes?"
73,"[Probably not the best shoes for the occasion,](https://i.imgur.com/TaPyt7q.png)

*^(then again tbf, he had no idea where they were headed off to)*"
74,"if they would stop wasting so much time balancing on these shoes, the progress of their society would skyrocket"
75,*society if Senku introduced them to normal shoes*
76,"Nice Jordans, Ginro"
77,"“Whaaat? Kinro? You’re wearing those $20 Walmart shoes? Not like my Jordan’s. These cost a pretty penny, you know!” -Ginro definitely"
78,Shoes are for walking in muddy conditions they have a practical use. Plus they help keep your feet above the horse shit in the roads in later period.
79,But he did. That was the second time they went there.
80,"It's often speculated that those shoes are a take on the Tengu-Geta (ie those Japanese wooden sandals, but with only one ""tooth"" instead of two). These were worn by mountain priests in the past because they're actually good for moving along mountainous terrains."
81,And muddy conditions where there is something solid underneath the mud like a well packed road.
82,"Take a good look at rock climbing shoes and mountain goats, and it all makes sense.

Chrome just had bad luck with stepping on loose rock."
83,More pressure is more friction which is more traction.
84,Before I knew it was toxic gas I wanted to swim in that water... so it seems accurate enough.
85,I didnt realize lakes of sulfuric acid really existed...
86,Is it actually true that silver turns black when it come into contact with sulfuric acid
87,"[It's true, it's a pretty simple reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed077p328A)"
88,"Honestly, this chapter was pretty ridiculous. Sulfuric acid isn't \*that\* insanely dangerous. The fumes will irritate your lungs and eventually cause you to suffocate, sure, but you'll likely go blind before you die from inhaling it -- unless it's displacing oxygen, in which case, they'd suffocate regardless of wearing a filter mask. And of course, they have no eye protection.

If Chrome fell in, he wouldn't instantly melt down to the bone like those birds did -- no acid is that ridiculously strong, unless superheated. Don't get me wrong, he'd still quickly go blind and take on serious, life-threatening damage, especially if they weren't able to quickly rinse him off. It's just not nearly as dramatic as they make it out to be, and they overlooked a lot of important factors.

Here's an example of what sulphuric acid does to skin: [https://youtu.be/XeVZQoJ5FdE?t=283](https://youtu.be/XeVZQoJ5FdE?t=283)

For a show trying so hard to be about science, it's very far from being scientifically accurate. One of the dumber moments is when Senku lit up a bamboo filament... on a fucking leaf, exposed to open air.

Anime: [https://i.gyazo.com/1504301f242b3074667fa6c00f9b1b6e.gif](https://i.gyazo.com/1504301f242b3074667fa6c00f9b1b6e.gif)

Regardless, it's still an entertaining story, and they did a kickass job on the anime. I just hope people realize that they should take the 'science' in this show with a heavy grain of salt and not turn into the next Rick & Morty fandom."

90,"Thanks Aiosiary. As I thought strong enough it's instant death. 

As pointed out light episode the light actually did not last longer than real life example in the Manga but that is called a dramatic pause where time is slowed to almost not moving to show reactions of all to event. 
This is being made with scientific experts involved don't assume this being done with poor research time.
As mentioned elsewhere goggles were probably required as well. So there will be stuff left out for dramatic effect in a way similar to the lack of helmets in current prior times warfare productions."
91,"I did overlook something vital about the light scene. The filament Senku uses is insanely thick. The amount of energy required to make that thing glow would be far more than they could produce with their equipment at the time.  


Even if they could get it to glow, both the leaf and the filament would burn and smolder. To most of the villagers, it'd look like they went through all that effort to make a really shitty torch."
92,"Sulfuric acid does not produce hydrogen sulfide, though. It's produced by the decomposition of animal waste, or manure.

Even if the lake somehow did produce hydrogen sulfide, it'd take a lot to reach a concentration of 0.2%. For comparison, carbon dioxide (which is also heavier than oxygen and nitrogen) at ground level is only at concentrations of 0.04%, which is still much higher than it used to be before mass pollution. The lake is completely exposed to open air. Gases, even when heavier than the surrounding air, disperse very easily. Just a slight breeze would be enough drastically reduce its concentration.

That document is most likely targeted towards farmers, who may be inclined to store massive amounts of manure inside of fully-enclosed sheds with little to no ventilation, where it can build up over a long period of time to reach toxic levels. This is the same gas used in a lot of homemade explosives, as concentrations between 4.5 to 45.5 percent (mostly only possible in a small, airtight environment) will explosively combust under the right conditions."
93,"Oh crap, Sully was terrifying (I should have expected this but no)."

102,"And your di.... well, I think you get the idea."
103,And my axe!
104,It's boichi. Of course it did.
105,"I really loved this bit, anthropomorphising a dangerous chemical as this sort of beautiful yet horrifying deadly monster. I think there's an argument to be made that compared to, say, 150 years ago, science has lost a sense of beauty. Old papers and books often were written in a more interesting prose, with the occasional metaphor or flourish. Today's scientific writing tends to be really dry. We need rigour to be able to do science that works, but sometimes sprinkling it a bit with art like this show does helps us relate to it, have fun with it, and thus feel it closer to us."
106,"Tbf, academic writing is different from writing for an audience. There's a ton of modern non-fiction books and articles that have really nice prose. I only really read stuff for the bio sciences though. Off the top of my head, I remembering crying over this article lol: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html"
107,"True, but nothing forbids being at least decently affable when writing papers too. There are occasionally papers that will use a funny turn of phrase, a punny title, or just will try to sound more like they've been written by a human being rather than an algorithm. The worst thing is, sometimes you get dragged along because that's how *everyone* writes and it's almost likes it won't sound as serious if you don't follow suit. But I swear I can't figure out why writing 'new' instead of 'novel' should make your science worse..."
108,"Oh, yeah, true. I don't particularly like the complete robotic-ness of it either. I actually really used to hate it. I was trying to defend modern science a bit, cause I feel like scientists of the olden days (1800s~) were more eloquent too, but I also think that their work was less objective. So, in that respect, I feel like documentaries and non-fiction writers would be a closer equivalent. That said, I definitely think academic writers in general could do better with writing, add that little spark and make it far more readable, even in clinically boring sections like methods. Sometimes it really is just bad writing that makes a piece so boring and hard to read. The ""novel"" vs ""new"" example is great - I feel like some academics are like high schoolers who bring out a thesaurus and use it in the worst way possible. Even lit analysis, which is by all means a subjective field, can be super dry if the author sucks at writing. I personally like articles in psychology journals most of all lol. To me, the writing tends to be legitametely entertaining, probably cause it's a soft science."
109,Wow what a beautifully written and depressing article. Shit’s fucked so I better watch more anime before we all die.
110,"I agree. I also like that the anime emphasizes 'Sulfy-chan' as something that Ginro imagines. The manga does that to a smaller degree, but here you have a real, invisible killer that Ginro's overactive imagination paints a horrific face on.

Sulfy-chan will, IRL, absolutely kill if she gets the chance, and that makes the characterization in the manga and anime more powerful."
111,"Actually, while I was watching the episode I told me brother that a lot of people would probably be confused by the anthropomorphised metaphor and start complaining about ""the 'realist' anime adding ghosts/spirits"" or something. I'm actually pleasantly surprised it didn't happen.

&#x200B;

And yeah, I think science texts can be somewhat dry, but that's something you can't avoid for professional material. I think it's easier to make it more ""colorful"" if you aren't trying to be taht professional in the first place."
112,"I absolutely don't believe you can't avoid it. You certainly can; of course a paper will never be an epic poem, but it can read better than just a passionless, grey list of formulas and operations. Here's a few examples:

https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/the-best-writing-in-science-papers-part-ii/

Some fields are more amenable to this than others - pure mathematics and theoretical physics probably lend themselves to it more than most. But it's by no means impossible. The thing is just about *how* you say stuff; as long as *what* you say stays unchanged, you're not affecting the rigour of the content."
113,Still 10/10 titties
114,Did you even watch the episode? It was done perfectly and improved.
115,"I think the anime art of her lost a bit of impact due to not being as detailed as the crazy Boichi manga art. All the little creases in the fluttering dress and the tiny details of her rotting, melting flesh dripping down her skull... the original really made her feel both ominous and terrible. This gave the right feeling, but to me, it didn't give me the same shiver."
116,"i don't think its a huge difference anime went pretty true to manga .Her skeletal form was creepy as fuck in anime ,and that voice the sound manga cant produce..got the chills"

The term they use in Japanese is ""Sutando-tsukai."""
135,"It's a pun in Japanese that's unfortunately kind of hard to translate. It's a reference to a word for mage/sorcerer, ""mahoutsukai"" from ""mahou"" (magic) + ""-tsukai"" (user). Being that Senku wants to defeat fantasy with science, he calls himself a ""kagakutsukai,"" where ""kagaku"" means science.

So your response isn't too far off from the intent."
136,"Yeah, in the manga they use 'sciencer' as a counterpart to 'sorcerer' and IMHO it works better. It's both a new word and something that you could imagine *be* the word for scientist in a different, parallel world in which some historical accident caused to be the ethimology to be slightly different."

[So is this an actual incident?](https://i.imgur.com/AAh9zVW.png) Tried doing a quick search but I couldn't find the exact incident Senku was recalling.

142,"I couldn't find the exact incident, but hydrogen sulfide can kill incredibly fast. A paramedic had her head just below waist level and died in a few seconds. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/paramedics-were-never-warned-of-deadly-gas/article20398802/"
143,"Hydrogen sulfide is scary as hell. Your nose can smell it at like 1/1000 the 'safe' limits for working without PPE, at 10x the limit though, you just stop being able to smell it. Did you get safe? Did you just walk further into the cloud?  You're about to find out, and the wrong answer isn't very appealing. 100x the limit (not that you'd know, as you cant smell the rotten eggs anymore) and you're approaching the instant-death territory."
144,"I basically have zero sense of smell due to my nose being shit, I wouldn't go near anything that could have something like that with a ten foot pole. Fucking Hell (and it's quite literal, as sulphur is certainly something you'd expect to find there...)."
145,ten foot poll might not be long enough

161,"> [Serious Ruri](https://i.imgur.com/mtkcpEf.jpg)

I know there's angles involved and yada yada but look at where her mouth is, just how large her chin is?

I did a very half assed job at stretching her facial features a bit on fucking paint and got this https://imgur.com/yYYhZzq

I'm not saying I think I'd do a better job than the staff or anything, I'm incredibly shit at any artistic field, just pointing out a particularly funny instance of how uncanny the character design is at times."
162,"She's literally looking down at Kokahu up from a pedestal. The one you did is good, but it changes the angle from looking down to looking at Kohaku face to face."
163,"like I said, I know there's angles involved, but that doesn't change the fact that the proportions are all messed up. For angles to be a justification they'd need to show more of her neck or maybe use some shading to represent the underside of her chin. The way it was drawn in this episode they just extended the area between the underlip and the chin massively and looks incredibly weird.

Look at how they drew Tsukasa looking down on Senku on episode 4 for example: https://imgur.com/vbCCCrC

Doesn't it look way more natural?"
164,"Senku is clearly missing a crucial piece of science: using underlings as sacrificial pawns for Science.

Seriously, it's episode 12, if the MC died here, it would be game over, and that would be amazing in its own way, but seriously fucked up."
165,I guess that what makes Senku different from other Anime Scientist. He values the people he works with.
166,">He values the labor potential the  people he works with have.

Ftfy."
167,"Yeah, he's a shonen protagonist"
168,Real scientists understand that science isn't a one man job. He's realistic in that regard.
169,"Despite what he says about being rational and logical, Senku has an incredibly strong moral compass. He basically isn't willing to put anyone in danger when he believes he could do it himself with the same risks. You see it when he confronts Tsukasa holding Yuzuriha hostage and again in this moment."
170,"Ah, remember back to the very first impression where he offers Taiju to ~~sniff~~ drink some petrol?  
(Yeah, we know he never planned to drink it, and they are friends deep down)"
171,"The MC died back in episode 5, it wasn't game over!"
172,"on the flip side, I'm really glad he's not turning into Light Yagami or Lelouch."
173,"You might be joking, but Sir Robert Boyle treated his lab workers like absolute shit, but only a couple were particularly liked because they made some pretty useful experiment tools.

One time, he made a worker mix some chemicals that could cause dangerous reactions. Keep in mind, these are manual laborers, not professional assistants. Boyle knew that mixing them could be dangerous, but after it blew up in the workers face and burned him, Boyle just blamed the worker. I think the worker then left to work for Isaac Newton instead.

In Boyle’s days, the scientist doesn’t work in the lab. He just hires cheap labor to work there. He doesn’t even read the lab reports, he hires a guy to read them out for him."
174,It made me wonder if the poisonous gases that was showcased were ever collected and created as weapons seeing how it causes instant death
175,We humans have made worse chemical weapons than Hydrogen Sulfide gas.
176,Mustard Gas comes to mind.  And thats quite easy to make...
177,Isn't Mustard Gas one of the milder ones? I was thinking Sarin Gas.
178,Well its way easyer to make.  Literally every house in America could make it.
179,"Well, that is a relief. We non Americans are safe."

186,"Hey hey, i never gave details... specifically to avoid a mess.  

Big brother is always out there...  

[](#hellopolice)"
187,"To be fair, it's also really easy to make accidentally, so everyone should know how to make it, to avoid it. It's not like it's easy to use as a weapon, there are far easier ways to kill other people, but it's easy to make it accidentally and poison yourself with it.

That said: 

Bleach and ammonia. Avoid mixing them, especially while indoors, and if you do accidentally mix them, do not breathe in that room until you are very sure the air has been cleared of it.

Very easy to make because they're both used for cleaning, and even if you don't mix them intentionally, using bleach in a toilet, and peeing in it, could also be dangerous since pee contains ammonia.

Anyway, to be safe, don't ever mix two different cleaning products, unless you know exactly what you're doing."
188,"Fair point. I remember there was a whole [King of the Hill episode](https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Bystand_Me) about Peggy giving out homemaking advice in the local newspaper and accidentally telling people to mix bleach and ammonia for a ""super cleaner"""
189,"Isn't it the one that's so easy to make, people died by producing it inadvertently while cleaning their house ?"
190,"And apparently even the Japanese could make Sarin

L👉🏽😎L👉🏽

Haha! ^(dark joke)"
191,"What is it made from? How could the average person make this?

Maybe Senku could use it to his advantage..."
192,"Im def not gonna tell you, you can google if you want but ide be careful.  Thats a fast way to end up on a list."
193,"Like we saw in this very episode, Senku has firm ethical beliefs even if he doesn't want to admit it. He's probably already thought of and dismissed the idea of chemical warfare by now."
194,"A pity, it'd be the most efficient means to eliminate Tsukasa, and doing that efficiently means fewer people ""die"" by being smashed. Thus, more people are saved. 

I punch those numbers into my calculator, it makes a happy face."
195,"> What is it made from? How could the average person make this?

You can google it in seconds but basically, you need bleach and one more extremely common and easy to get ingredient that I won't mention you can find it on your own."
196,Stop acting like it'll get you on a list. It should be common knowledge so people will know that mixing cleaners is a bad bad bad bad fucking idea. It's ammonia. Never mix chlorine bleach and ammonia.
197,"Nah I don't think it will get me on a list I just don't want to give that information to potently really stupid people that will try it at home. If they find it, it should be on their own.

And as for it needing to be common knowledge. From where I am it is our parents always told us to never pee near bleach or mix bleach with ammonia."
198,"I've actually peed in bleach when it was in the WC. Nasty smell, but not exactly deadly. Pretty sure you need higher concentrations of both chemicals for it to be dangerous."
199,"Fresh human urine is dilute enough to be mostly safe unless you're very dehydrated. Cat urine or places where the urine is allowed to sit for a while aren't. In any case, always use bleach in a well-ventilated area. It's dangerous because most of the time you don't know you're in trouble until you're already on the verge of passing out."
200,Same. It wasn't until my pee hit the bleach water that I realized wait a minute piss contains ammonia and stopped.
201,"I actually feel like since it's such a commom household equipment people should be more alert of the dangers of mixing them.

Like I heard for the first time in a tv show or something (edit: I think it was a youtube video that actually used both chemicals but put a disclaimer that they should never be allowed to be near eachtother because of the safety issue) that you can't mix bleach with ammonia, that was the first time I ever heard of that and I never knew what exactly it made, just some ""toxic gas"" I never actually thought that it would actually be this dangerous."
202,"That's what they were doing on Madoka too, right? When the witch-possessed people tried to commit mass suicide, then Sayaka stopped them."
203,"Yeah, that's exactly the same stuff. When reading this comment chain I thought of the same thing...along with an unrelated Daria quote about hair dye.

> Daria - This stuff stinks. Why can't they just mix it before they put it in the bottle?

> Jane - Because the vapors would build up and it would explode.

> Daria - Oh. Well, that sounds like something I'd want seeping into my scalp."
204,Not sure if it's still in effect but the patriot act allows the govt to spy on suspected terrorists and while looking up certain info is not illegal it could make you a suspected terrorist
205,Better round up [every single person who has ever bought a bottle of bleach](https://ssl.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I00008rNec9OXyY8/s/860/860/Fphoto-52820112B-2MD.jpg) off the shelf then.
206,"Yeah, Japanese folks are not really willing to talk about Sarin gas much due to a certain terrorist attack. Mawaru Penguindrum approaches the topic VERY obliquely, and then never names the gas."
207,Yes but Mustard really easy to make and was easy to think of. Mustard killed thousands in WWI and a much higher number were crippled by it. Sarin Gas was designed actually as a pesticide experiment in 39 and they realized it would be great in chemical warfare. But there was almost no chemical warfare In WWII even though all sides had chemical weapons. This mainly thought to be because it's use when the other side has it only makes things more miserable with no advantage to either side. I learned at US Army Infantry Officer Basic course that treaties on Warcrimes normally followed when it to advantage of all sides to follow them.
208,"The gas that has killed the most people officially is Phosgene Gas, COCL2 (around 85k people during WW1). This is somewhat due to the fact that after that people didn't really use chemical weapons that much because ironically they aren't really as effective on an actual battlefield. Out of the millions killed during The Great War around 120k were due to Phosgene, Mustard and Chlorine etc gasses.

Phosgene can be made fairly easilly, as long as you have the components. However, after a few hours post exposure to the gas, your lungs will swell and you might die."
209,"Yes learned at US Army Infantry Officer Basic School. Gas when both sides have it only gums up things and thus even though all sides had Gas in WWII it was not used in significant ways. US Army was preparing to use poison gas taking what was left of Tokyo during a ground invasion though. (not much left of Tokyo, pictures of it after firestorm attacks can be confused with Hiroshima atomic attacks.)
Also taught treaties on prohibited weapons work when it a advantage to both side"
210,"Science can be a cure and a poison, sadly."
211,"Fun fact: When my dad was in HS, him and a friend/ coworker accidentally made Mustard Gas while mixing cleaning supplies the back of the grocery store. It leaked into the store and people started passing out so they had to evacuate. They weren't fired surprisingly because the boss (who told them to clean in the first place) never told them what to clean with."
212,is it the one that made with bleach and toilet cleaner?
213,"Bad in terms of effects yeah, though not going to cause instant death. Points for easy to make though, don't think anything immediately lethal can be made using household ingredients like mustard gas can."
214,"H2S still has a very high kill count.  It's transported in pipelines for a very good reason. 

Alberta has issues of it building up in depressions naturally because of the oil deposits."
215,"Its all about concentration. Hydrogen Sulfide is only dangerous to the point of instant death in concentrations where locally there is no oxygen, like in a volcanic hotspring in the episode for instance."
216,"You'd need to collect gas from the entire lake surface to use as a weapon, otherwise it'd disperse too quickly to be effective."
217,Gallows humor made me smile. Answer WWI gas.
218,"Given that it's heavy, you would have to throw it at somebody's face for it to have effect, I think."
219,And even then I think a shattering glass container launched at your head would work to a similar effect
220,"THE [SIREN](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/427603950158479361/624628789518925854/unknown.png) was so freaking awesome

239,"For all the people saying ""why don't they make a metal chain/long rod/complicated gizmo"" instead of gas masks:

For them in their current position, their limiting factor is labor.  Forging iron is incredibly manpower intensive, and they're under time pressure.  Each time they want to make more, it requires hundreds of man-hours for collecting iron sand and working the air pumps at the smelter.  They only have a limited amount of manual labor available to them.  They can't simply conscript the people in the village, especially now that they know that accepting Senku's favors like the ramen comes with a cost.  They also can't be working the blowers at the same time they're intensively training for the competition.

Further, they don't have the any of the tools or technology in place that they would need to do any metalworking, and their iron stock is extremely limited.  So far, we've only seen them make iron twice, and both times were simple castings done by pouring the molten iron into premade molds (one for the square bars they used to make magnets, and one for the round tube they use for glassblowing).

In comparison, **making the gas masks is relatively quick**.  They have plenty of leather and bamboo lying around, and making activated charcoal isn't labor-intensive."
240,"Also because it's entertainment. If this were intended to be a realistic survival simulation, we wouldn't have had Tsukasa punching out lions or stone age ramen. The goal isn't to tell a fully realistic story, it's to be a fun adventure about scientific inventions."
241,what was unrealistic about the ramen?
242,So why not a long wooden rod and/or rope?
243,"Melts just as easy under sulfuric acid.

My thought was of making a thick bottle and constantly throwing it at the lake and pulling it back. It could work, but how would you protect the rope?

Also, the distance isn't clear, but the actual lake could be theoretically rather far from the ""safe zone""(under quotes, because the damn thing is open to air and in a damn crater, a false wind and you could be done for)"
244,"I was thinking something like a crane arm, from which you could carefully lower a container on rope. I agree that the actual distance wasn't clear though."
245,That probably take way more time then they have especially you have to carry lots of heavy stuff to the site.
246,"Eh one long pole made of several shorter ones lashed together, a rope, and a pulley are all you need. If the distance is great enough add a vertical support and another rope. It's simpler than what Senku used to rescue Kohaku, would take a comparable amount of time to prepare, and could be easily carried by a small group of people. Especially if one of those people is a gorilla."
247,"Let's be real the show could make whatever it wants to as long as senku is around


Especially so if you've read the manga **ahem**"
248,"[I love Ginro's spiteful face](https://imgur.com/a/ArAKTkV)

[I love that Senku looks like he's about to pass out from the hike](https://imgur.com/a/YhIy1lj)

WHAT?! They're gonna make gas masks?! That's awesome!

Senku is constantly training and teaching Chrome to be his successor in case he dies. He won't let Chrome go on any dangerous missions, because he needs him to carry on science. But Chrome's pretty stubborn, and he wants to help Senku and back him up.

[I lost it here](https://imgur.com/a/yPVRzOy)

#[**THAT IS SO COOL!!!**](https://imgur.com/a/ecY7c1W)

I love that Senku is trying to reassure Chrome that they'll be okay with the gas masks, but at the same time he's shaking with fear. This is the most dangerous thing he's done since he left the hot springs.

I like that Senku packed ""tape"" in case the acid melted him breathing tube.

How strong is that spear that it doesn't snap from Chrome's weight? More importantly, how strong is Ginro that he can hold Chrome without him dipping into the spring?!

Way to go Ginro! Face your fears!

This show never ceases to impress me every episode. With each new thing they introduce every week I'm just sitting there going, ""That is so cool! Science is awesome!"""
249,Ginro had to be made a gate guard for some reason. Definitely not his brains.
250,I kept thinking that making a very long stick with a jar on the tip would've been much simpler and safer but I can't deny gas masks are a much cooler solution
251,"They would've needed gas masks anyway to seal the container and to work with it later. 

And making a stick long enough to be safely usable would be tricky considering the pool of sulfuric acid is at a big slope and it seems like the poison line was about halfway down. 

It's also just, ya know, more narrative poignant to face the danger head-on."
252,"> They would've needed gas masks anyway to seal the container and to work with it later.

A couple liters of sulfuric acid in open air aren't even close to *a whole freaking lake of it in a mountain bowl*. They won't need the masks for that. Though maybe the problem is that the lake would have simply melted the stick? Or the poison limit was too far to find a long enough stick."
253,The gas isn't only a foot or two above the water. A decent gust would send it all over the mountain crater. The only way to be safe would be to wear a gas mask.
254,"Yeah, I thought they were going to build a crane or some other pulley contraption, rather than make gas masks."
255,"Well they eventually did that at the end of the episode, so it's the best of both worlds."
256,"Except that with the gas masks they literally risked dying while when going with the big stick approach from the start the worst that could happen would be to drop it and loose a bit of wood and glass

The show already estabilished it has a high suspension of disbelief requirement when Tsukasa started killing lions barehanded so there's no point in nitpicking too much at this point, but when the risks involved are literally life threatening it does bother me a bit they wouldn't at least try a safer solution"
257,"I have no idea how you keep the acid from eating your contraptions ropes and wooden parts, with metal gearing you could probably duplicate the dip of only glass but they not at that tech level and any contraption big enough to not need masks as a safety to big to build and place quickly."
258,"I was thinking something along the line of a bucket tied to a rope. Just launch it into that lake and haul it back out from a safe distance. Works best if they can find a position mostly vertical to the lake of course, if not they might need to get clever in how they design the bucket."
259,The trick is getting the glass jar into the lake without the ropes making contact.
260,Or they could've made a long tube and a pump instead of trusting in a filter.
261,This was a very strong episode. It helped develop Chrome and Ginro to no end and even Senku was shown to be [afraid](https://imgur.com/XxTzpIW) of what could happen. And [this](https://imgur.com/r9msjyk) was VERY ominous. The way they use the music every episode is also so well done. Dr Stone stays as my AOTS and maybe even AOTY.
262,The soundtrack is good. Nice timing on how they use it

265,Never before have bagpipes sounded so good.
266,"Ehhh its okay, definitely a good anime, but doesn't top some of the other gems we had especially this Summer season."
267,"I think it's a really nice contrast to Fire Force, especially since they both air on fridays. I like Fire Force (i'm completely up to date on the manga for both shows) but it's pretty typical Battle Shonen Standard fare most of the time (even with its better than average animation for its anime). Whereas Dr Stone feels so fresh and takes the Mundane made awesome trope to a whole new level (modern day conveniences we take for granted being recreated/rediscovered showing us how great they really are). It's my personal favorite anime of this Summer Season and I don't think saying it's a contender for AOTS or AOTY is really too much of a stretch."
268,"I'll wait until MHA S4 to make that call but between Dr.stone and kimetsu no yaiba (I haven't even seen a single second of this series) we definitely have very strong contenders for AOTY.

Also, don't forget the scene with the old man. No one is immune to fear. Fear is the secret to a long life."
269,"KnY is the best this season for me, but I doubt we'll get anything that surpasses MP100 II this year."

322,Comment Face when?
323,"Aaaaahhhhhh, it felt so short agaaaain!! I need 10 billion more episodes."
324,Chrome using Senku's catchphrase was so fucking awesome this episode.
325,please tell me this anime has 24 episodes. This would be a kinda meh ending for a seasnn
326,"24, well be getting a new opening in episode 14"
327,"> getting a new opening in episode 14

But my ohaiyo sekai"
328,*good morning world~*
329,おはいお　せかい！
330,Is it not Yo instead of the second O? I'm only a month into beginners japanese at uni though
331,"Oh crap it is! I’m an beginner too lmao

How’s your studies coming?"
332,I think it's going okay. Verbs are kinda tough though.
333,thanks! I thought so after the ending of the episode but now i know for sure
334,It's going to be incredibly difficult to top good morning world
335,Yep OP and ED song is gonna be hard to surpass
336,"Ed: yeah definitely

Op: nah I think it's very possible"
337,"This. I've been listening to that song nonstop since Dr. Stone came out, it's gonna be REAL hard to not have it playing."
338,"I did not know we are getting 2 main arcs, that's hype as hell!"
339,I thought this was the finale and almost went ahead to read the manga. Guess I'm waiting again
340,Read the manga anyways. There's so much detail and some really hilarious moments from the earlier arc that were toned down.
341,I'll probably read from the beginning whenever I get into the manga then. Thanks for the heads up
342,NOOOOOOO
343,It's 2-cour at least I believe
344,"Silver spear get! And despite the fact that it's a matter of life and death it's still a shame that Ginro is stuck doing Skyward Sword dousing with it though.



As morbid as it may be I understand Senku's practical decision to leave Oz behind and leave his knowledge with him was a sound one. Even if Oz didn't stand for it. But that goes to the whole friendship and overcoming fear with bravery that was being talked about.


But stone age gas masks. That's not something you'd expect to ever see. And it's really quite cool."
345,"They're past the stone age. They've made iron and glass so they're at [the iron age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_periods#Technology_periods), at the rate they're going on the verge of the machine age."
346,"True but they've just been referring to the world they're living in now as ""a stone world"" all this time so yeah."
347,Don't forget all the stone statues around.
348,don't forget they recently generated electricity so they are pass iron age too
349,"It's not exactly mass produced stuff though. Hero of Alexandria built widgets that spun and moved around with steam around 50 AD, but would you say then he kickstarted the steam age because of that?"
350,Then let's settle for saying [he's entered the Classical Era](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fvignette2.wikia.nocookie.net%2Fcivilization%2Fimages%2F5%2F5d%2FClassicalEraCiv5_ScreenArt.png%2Frevision%2Flatest%3Fcb%3D20131130201404&f=1&nofb=1_)
351,"We need a Civ mod for the Kingdom of Science, with Senku as the leader in the diplomacy screen."
352,"That's why I said 'on the verge of' and 'at the rate they're going'. If/when Senku builds a steam engine it will be to do useful work, not spin widgets."
353,I still think though that it’s not really enough to claim they’ve progressed beyond the Stone Age until you have a sustainable chain of production for all that stuff. If Senku and Chrome died they would be back to square one in a moment.
354,Yep except luck factor means somewhere else in the world someone is way more advanced by now. ;) Unless same luck American movies have for American events apply to Japanese movies and Japan events.
355,Oz?
356,"Yeah I've been referring to Chrome as Oz since he first showed up for fun. His whole shtick as a ""sorcerer"" doing ""magic"" with his rainbow bridge and such when he first appeared reminded me of the charlatan Oz from Wizard of Oz using his tricks to dupe the people into thinking he's an actual wizard.


I also for fun refer to Tsukasa as Kraven and Kohaku as Ayla. It's just a fun thing I've decided to roll with."
357,Is that one example of that scientist that instantly died by breathing the gas in real? If so has anyone a link to more informations about it?
358,"Above 500ppm, H2S can be instantly lethal. [This PDF](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/books-guides/hydrogen-sulfide-in-industry?lang=en&direct) from Work Safe BC lists an example where one person working on a valve collapsed from exposure, as did the next two people. Only when people with self-contained breathing apparatuses came could they rescue the three affected. The first two died, the third was resuscitated."
359,"thanks but i didnt mean that, might have said it weird. i wondered if the scenario itself was real or not, and if there was any documentation about it"
360,"Couldn't find anything conclusive but I did come across this neat video. Towards the end the guy's pants gets corroded by the sulfuric acid.

362,"Presumably the article for that specific occurrence is a Japanese article, which is why it's so hard for us western peeps to find. However, similar incidents have happened on multiple occasions - at high concentrations, a single breath *will* kill you."
363,"In the manga it's pretty directly stated as ""This is a real thing that definitely happened, look it up"". But I don't know anything about it because I didn't look it up."
364,"It's hard to look it up. Maybe it was some older Japanese news, which are understandably harder for us to find in English?"

381,"There's a similar issue with some of the cliffs in Ireland.

You're straight on the Atlantic so there are reasonable winds at the best of times so don't dangle your legs over a cliff."
382,"Can confirm I did hop a fence at an Irish cliff for a new Facebook profile pic. In my defense, I was smart enough not to stand on the edge."
383,I wonder how many deaths occur from people falling off the ledge at Lysefjord in Norway? I've seen people sitting on the ledge of that cliff and it puts the ones in Ireland to shame!
384,Grand Canyon has had a good number of people falling in. I think the Selfie ones the most stupid.

387,They don't want to build a ugly fence blocking the view from everyone just to keep the stupid out. And it's a large area as well. The fences are to warn people not stop them as they are normally kept low enough they don't block the view.
388,natural selection at it's finest
389,"> Like i cant even feel sorry for him, this is just Idiotic.

Pretty much why The Darwin Awards are a thing. When someone dies due to their own stupidity, it's hard to feel pity and instead much easier to both learn from it and enjoy the Schadenfreude."
390,I believe most of the deaths are people trying to help their dogs that fall in a hot spring. Very tragic stories about these horrifying death pools. So weird how so many japanese animes romanticize them but hot springs are fucking terrifying no thank you I will stay out of the boiling pool of acid.
391,Well because hot springs are good when they aren't strong acid pools. And public hot springs are very much safe to use.
392,I was referring to the Yellowstone stories I've read. I know there are safe hot springs in BC Canada and Japan but the Yellowstone stories are horrifying.
393,The hot springs that anime romanticises aren't the same as acid pools.
394,Is the story about the man who knelt down true? Might be a real accident...
395,"Also would like to know this. Tried to search it up, but didn't find anything. I would expect it to be, with this show being based in real life technology and techniques, and locations in some form."
396,There are lots of deaths similar to that kneeling man though.
397,"Then give us a source on at least one, we wish to read"

Not quite the same thing, but thanks for the link"
401,The story my professor told was of a traveling group who made camp for the night. In the morning they found 2 tents dead because they set up further down the decline.
402,All of the stuff in this show besides the petrification fantasy which the show acknowledges is fantasy is scientifically accurate if a bit too perfect and unlikely. And tsukasa and other times you see humans do things they could only do in an anime. The scientific stuff like making all that stuff they've made is real.
403,I tried googling it but nothing relevant came up. Somebody?
404,"There is a real story about a massive gas cloud releasing from a lakebed and killing ever person and animal in a valley as the gas settles in and suffocates anything in that valley. Nightmare stuff if you start looking that shit up. You can find lots of articles like that on /r/creepywikipedia

There are absolutely crazy things out there that have killed people just like that. The most poisonous substance on earth would probably blow your mind once you fully understood the meaning of median lethal dose."
405,"that was a carbon monoxide burp iirc. Different method of death: suffocation. Long, drawn out, inescapable suffocation.

it doesn't matter if you can breathe if all you have to breathe is carbon monoxide."
406,It's an inert gas I believe so at least they didn't suffer as the brain thinks it's still inhaling oxygen.
407,I want to know this too
408,"> Scott's sister was recording on her cell phone when he fell in, but the park service won't release the video.

My morbid curiosity is screaming."
409,The birds dying mid-air and then dissolving in the water is about as tame as you can do. I guarantee you that the death and resulting corpse were pretty fucking horrific. I NEVER want to see that kind of shit.
410,"It's more of ""I want to see how it happened so that I could avoid or know what to do if I come across a similar scenario"" thing.

Actually part of the reason why I miss r/watchpeopledie. I'm with those paramedics, police enforcers, etc, who have voiced out that the sub has indeed helped them in one way or another."
411,"In high concentrations the gas, H2S, kills you pretty quickly, but in low concentrations it isn’t that harmful and you will notice it because it reeks like rotten eggs.

I study chemistry and a professor once brought a big bottle of dissolved H2S with him and you could smell it in the whole lecture hall. He told us that as long as we could smell it we were safe, once you can’t smell it anymore the concentration is to high and it’s deadly. It’s also one of the reasons why you can smell rotten eggs in many volcanic areas and hot springs, like the one shown in this episode

Edit: Sulfuric acid is also pretty dangerous, as it dissolves most organic matter into carbon pretty easily, but it’s actually pretty okay to work with. Of course it isn’t comfortable if you get concentrated one on your skin, but as long as you wash it off pretty quickly it doesn’t really harm you."
412,I don't know anything about chemistry. Is there a safer way to H2S? Also if the concentration of H2S was so high  then should they have protected their eyes and skin too?
413,"They aren’t after the H2S, they are after the sulfuric acid, aka H2SO4, both just naturally occur at volcanic areas. They probably should have worn some kind of goggles to be really safe, but it shouldn’t be that much of a problem, H2S is only really dangerous when you breathe it in, contact with the skin shouldn’t be that big of a problem, especially if they wash themselves afterwards."
414,Is there a reason you keep referring to it as H2S? Is that what the gas would be while the lake is H2SO4?
415,"Yeah, that’s it, sorry, if I wasn’t clear before"
416,"H2S = Hydrogen Sulfide. 2 Hydrogen atoms and one sulfur atom. H2SO4 = Sulfuric acid: 2 hydrogen, 1 sulfur, 4 oxygen atoms. Related but different compounds."
417,"Yes, that's what most refineries will actually do, they put the H2S through some reactors that release the hydrogen and formulate liquid sulfur from the gas, double make sure by scrubbing the leftover gas with amine (which sucks in any remaining H2S) and they burn off the biproduct."
418,"Also made it back in my high school science class in very small amounts, and it stinks a whole lot for the amount we made."
419,"Yes, I worked briefly in a Sulfur plant where we would pluck Sulphur from H2S to make it safer and easier to burn out the gas stack. In most safety oriented work forces anything higher than 0ppm and they will want you with a gas monitor or mask, anything above 15ppm and you're locking down the whole area to do the job or find the leak.

&#x200B;

The part thats extra spooky is once you hit 100ppm you cease to smell it and it starts to make you feel drunk so you make even more poor decisions and think ""Nah i'm still alright"".

Anything higher than 700ppm and you instantly pass out and die.

So you have a colorless, odorless super death gas floating around, and usually if someone dies, you have no idea what just happened to them so uneducated people rush in and also get knocked down. Theres lots of cases of 6+ fatalities because people go in one after the other to save the last guy."
420,Whoa that is literally chain kills
421,"Hydrogen Sulfide gas? HELL YES. It's exactly the instant killer Senku describes. If you see a green pond in the middle of nowhere, you should back the fuck up."
422,"I haven't found anything about a whiff of it suddenly killing you, like that guy who tied his shoes. It's undoubtedly dangerous but I'm pretty sure it shouldn't kill you in mere seconds."
423,Concentrations of hydrogen sulfide of over 700-1000 ppm is known to cause immediate collapse and nervous damage after a single breath. Anything higher than that is pretty much [instant death.](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hydrogensulfide/hazards.html)
424,"To be fair, it says ""nearly"" instant death.  Clearly, Dr. Stone is being unrealistic here. /s"
425,It will. You underestimate the power of high concentration H2S.
426,"Check the article someone else commented above, it is not exactly just tying the shoe but the time to exposure is pretty close https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/paramedics-were-never-warned-of-deadly-gas/article20398802/

Also it's odorless at high concentration so you wouldn't notice it when you start exposing to it, that's why they need the silver spear."
427,"Ginro is the real MVP here. And Chrome is best boy. 

What's up with Kohaku offering herself as a wife lmao. That was totally unexpected."
428,And the way chrome responded.
429,'Twas a joke.
430,"She wants to be Senku's waifu, but Senku's waifu is SCIENCE. She *knows* that everyone, including her sister and Chrome would be happy if the two married, but the village is close enough to bare survival that love is a secondary concern in a marriage."
431,"Can I just say that Ginro is my favorite character precisely thanks to the contrast between moments like [this](https://i.imgur.com/qJ3rFiK.jpg) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/M3Jj4Rr.jpg)? It is so satisfying to see a coward overcoming himself and doing something heroic. ~~Well, this, and he is also cute af which is not important at all haha...~~"
432,"Ginro is important to the story precisely because scientific experimentation is deadly dangerous, and he's ~~a fucking coward~~ has a great survival instinct. Ginro *feels* how deadly a situation is, and reacts *appropriately*, thus our introduction to the show's BEST GIRL, Sulfy-chan."

435,"Luckily that spear was strong enough to hold Chrome. It would be funny after all that time spent talking about overcoming fear the spear just snaps.
Also Ginro seems pretty strong to be able to hold Chrome like that."
436,"Lifting the spear upwards to launch Chrome into the air is probably easiest way to ensure it snapping too, he really should've just pulled him inwards"
437,"Or he could have rotated 90° to the side and let him off on the ground, I think that would have been even easier"
438,Wouldn't a really long pole have been the better solution here?
439,"Up to a certain length it would be fine, but too long and it would be unwieldy, the acid could touch the rope tying the glass thing by mistake and it would fall into the lake."
440,"They made a whole lab's worth of glass materials, they definitely could've made some kind of contraption that didn't need rope at all. A laundry hamper type glass container with like holes for handles they could just stick a pole through and lower it into the pool from a distance or something"
441,A long stick with a fishing line pulley thingy
442,I think The thing that would connect the bottle with the pole would more than likely melt in the acid
443,"Chrome did have a long pole Jr that he used to scoop up some acid in. Take that, but make a Grande version of it."
444,I'm not even sure I understand what everyone thinks they should have done but from ya'll ideas: do you really think they would have been able to handle something THAT heavy while balancing it in a life or death situation?
445,My thoughts throughout the episode. Not very logical to make gas masks and take a risk.
446,"The way I see it, they need the gas masks if they want to work with the chemical and not die."
447,"The gas mask was more of a character development thing I think, there are also safer ways to PRODUCE sulfuric acid using sulfur and potassium nitrate(both of which they already have)"
448,"It is not clear how close the ""safe zone"" is from the edge of the lake.

It could be 3 meters, but it could also be more than 20.

You could make a metal rod that long, but as people already said, metal is very hard to come by for them, and any carbon based material would risk being melted by splash or bubbles."
449,"They had the detector to have an idea where it was safe. They had a short stick tied to a glass container. Just tie a few sticks together and scoop from what seems a safe distane.

Much safer than going down there with really basic gasmask. I get why it was done this way, it's just not all that logical."
450,They have both a time limitation and a labour limitation. That would have taken more time and effort than making some gas masks.
451,I could tie a couple of sticks together in a matter of minutes
452,Wouldn't be stable enough for a glass container full of liquid.
453,Why is no one talking about how good Chrome's voice actor is? Like holy fuck that scene where he talks Senku into letting him go gave me chills
454,"Don't patronize me, asshole."
455,"One of them just dying there would have certainly been something...

I'm starting to get worried tbh"
461,"Screw those two, I'm here for Senku and science all day long. Be fine if we never see them again. 

Gen: ""oh yeah that one loud idiot tried to stop Tsukasa smashing some statues and got necked HARD. Dumbass."""
462,"i don't really like Taiju as a character in Anime, too much screaming, too over reacted, even for an anime character to be too anoying to like. But i still looking for him and yuzuriha character's development aside from a joke, a oaf and lots of annoying screaming"
463,That is one heck of a sturdy spear wood.
464,"I love all the little things in this show. Senku's hands shaking was pretty impactful considering how confident he usual appears. Just shows he's still very human, and how terrifying that situation would be. I think they captured it a bit better in the manga"
465,If you know what happens when you mix sulfuric and nitric acid you know that we are in for some explosions
466,Too bad that Senku lost his supply of nitric acid
467,"Well, according to wikipedia, there are actually several ways to synthesize nitric acid. Including an arc of electric charge across moist air. It wouldn't be a fast process, but they can make electricity and they have water and glass vessels. At high temperature nitrogen and oxygen in air will combine to the difficult ingredient, nitrogen dioxide.

Alternatively now that they have sulfuric acid, they can make nitric acid using sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate (saltpeter) and sulfuric acid."
468,"I doubt they can make a high enough voltage with that hand crank to create an electric arc, so I don't think that first method would work."
469,"They would need to make a capacitor to store up the electricity so it can be released all at once. A primitive capacitor such as a [Leyden jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyden_jar) would work. It's a glass bottle filled with water, with a metal spike driven through the stopper."
470,"Right, I forgot capacitors were pretty easy to make."
471,"This episode made me respect and like all characters even more, especially Ginro."
472,What made you discover your newfound respect for Magma?
473,Magma is easily defeated by Ocean
474,"I, too, am easily defeated by Ocean. Does that make me hot?"
475,"So while I already knew that sulfuric acid was deadly I didn't know how it would affect you. [Here's](https://youtu.be/xK4z_YhtTBM) a video showing it's effect on sugar.

Nice imagery for the pond with the evil fairy."
476,"Dear Lord, that bit with the cubes is a horror show. That's literally what you show to an VFX crew and say ""this, make that body do this."""
477,Right? It's so gross.
478,"Reality check: Ok let's get real here, Chrome would be 100% dead because the stick cant support that much weight, the stick will break and Chrome will die. Nuff said. Its anime."
479,A dude killed a lion with one punch.  All bets were off a long time ago.
480,"Yeah lmfao, they weren't exactly hiding the fact that the show isn't realistic lol"
481,Realism with a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief. It's Realism+!
482,For a low low price of 9.99 you yourself can order this newly minted  **Realism+!**
483,He also caught an arrow and punched a guy.
484,[deleted]
485,Wait is the story being framed/narrated from a character's in-universe perspective? When was this explained?
486,"I have no problem with Kohaku. Why she can't be strong and fast? She is totally realistic.
And did you just made your own head-canon? lol"
487,"Kohaku is impossibly strong. Some of the agility motions she makes are literally not doable. Not to mention with her figure it's even more impossible she has her kind of strength. There is nothing realistic about her.

That being said, although he phrased it weird I think the guy was saying you can look at it like a verbal retelling, even though that's not canon.

Anyways, it doesn't really matter either way if it's just anime dramatization. It's just a scene there to build up Ginro's character. The only scenes that should bother you when they are dramatized are ones that feel cheap, break the theme of the show, or are dramatic for no reason."
488,"Kohaku is ""totally realistic""?... Cmon bruh."
489,"Yeah I don't understand what they mean by saying Kohaku can't be strong and fast, there are women IRL who could lift cars and shit over their head without breaking a sweat.

I guess the unrealistic part would be that she looks like a super model and isn't incredibly buff, because I mean if she were really that strong she'd have to have SOME muscle showing, but its anime so meh."
490,"For one, the guy said ***that*** strong and fast. As in sending people flying 10 metres with one hit from a staff and moving at superhuman speeds.

More importantly though, show me a video of a woman lifting a car over her head without breaking a sweat because that would be a pretty cool sight to see."
491,"I'd settle for a video of anybody lifting a car over their head (sweat or not). The deadlift world record is 500kg , and even a volkswagen beetle from the 60s (modern beetles weigh more) weighs 800kg."
492,"lol ifkr, and that's deadlifting, not even close to holding something over your head. plus, that records by a dude looking like the closest human thing to the hulk"
493,yeah but what about the over head press world record
494,You can't do the overhead press without deadlifting that same weight first.
495,"You could have just googled it, it's much lower, but more importantly I assumed ""...lift cars and shit over their head..."" meant picking it up off the ground. I went with the lower bar of only having to lift it halfway up and still nobody can do that."
496,"> there are women IRL who could lift cars and shit over their head without breaking a sweat.

Citation needed."

525,"While others are arguing why Senku didn't make other form of contraptions (pulley system) to get the liquid. I can understand it because of the following:

Gas mask is much easier to make given their materials.

It is much safer and less of a risk than having a system of several moving parts that may fall apart when exposed to the acidic atmosphere.

They may use a gas mask still when making the drug.  So they will make it anyway

The terrain of the lake is uneven and they climbed just to get there. So moving a system is a huge undertaking. Gas mask is much practical.

Gas Mask make them look cool. Got to admit that.

&#x200B;

I can shrug off that part. But not the part where Ginro save Chrome. That is some strong spear to hold a weight like that. Ginro also is superhuman to hold Chrome which is much more heaver than him. If physics will have a play, the spear will snap or Chrome's weight will topple also Ginro and both of them will be Sulfy Chan's part of the harem.

Spies have the purpose of espionage (which is useless since they have no means of communication with Senku) and sabotage (they don't really have a way to sabotage one punch man and he's going along with his revival). This is all compounded by the fact that Senku has essentially abandoned his quest to stop Tsukasa. ""But what if he wants numbers on his side by winning the village over."" Doesn't help since Tsukasa has infinitely more. I don't know, I feel like persuing gunpowder again would be the best route. Any resource he no longer has access to could be searched for.

From what I saw, they just don't need to breath during the process.

They could have just:

1. Hold their breath, there are primitive people, someone should have better stamina to hold their breath and find this someone to help.
2. Make a long (glass)pipe and pump the acid out from a safe distance.

Why no one has thought about that? Am I fundamentally wrong about logic?"

556,"1. Making the gas masks only takes them a few hours.  They have plenty of leather and bamboo, and creating the activated charcoal filter material is done easily with the materials on hand.  They certainly could try and run in and out, and it might work, but making gas masks easy enough that it's worth taking the precaution. 

2. Even if they could make a very long glass pipe and transport it multiple kilometers without it breaking, how do they generate enough vacuum force to suck the acid along its entire length?  The simple leather gaskets they use for the forge blowers aren't going to be strong enough to move liquids, and will quickly be destroyed by the acid. Trying to suck it out like siphoning water or gasoline would be instant death via hydrogen sulfide inhalation."
557,"They couldn't ""just hold their breath"", the process was too long. How long can *you* hold your breath? While also performing tiring physical labour?"

You mean 1 billion percent"
580,Lol - I stand corrected
581,"No, I said you tie a rope to the end of that stick and lower it down with the rope. If you have a problem getting it down there safely, you could use a sacrificial wheeled cart just to get it dipped in the edge of the lake, and then pull it up without the rope contacting.

And glass beakers are not that fragile, it's not like you tap them and they shatter. Especially if they just custom made a really thick one, which would be easier than making gas masks.

There *are* possible ways to get around it, and they didn't even *attempt* any of them, despite them being fairly low cost and easy to test.

It's seriously hard to believe they are simultaneously intelligent *and* care about reducing risk whilst not trying any possible lower risk methods."
582,"I am not sure after dipping a flask in sulfuric acid, on how you are going to rid of the sulfuric acid surrounding the outer side of the flask. This does not sound like a practical solution compared to the gas masks they made."
583,"What part of ""they both literally almost died but were saved by luck and a deus ex machina"" sounds practical to you?

They didn't need to get rid of sulfuric acid on the outside of the flask with their current method, did they? Why would they need to now?

Just take a pair of tongs or something with you."
584,"As if tongs are going to prevent them from almost falling off due to an unexpected event like ground eroding off and causing a slip.

They did take something - gas masks.

Regarding the flask being submerged in acid, dipping it and manually collecting it are two different things. The thing about acid is, and whether you are aware of it or not, you NEVER rinse off highly concentrated acid from something with water, because it causes an explosion. With the way they collected it, there is less of the flask surface covered with acid, so it is safer to handle the flask later and rid off any residue acid at the mouth of the glass bottle they used.

I don't object to the idea that trying to keep a safer distance for collection is a definitely a better one, but so far ""just make longer sticks"" and ""pulley system"" have not been explained to be safer and equally effective at collecting sulfuric acid. You still have to stand at a slope and have a likely chance of slipping and falling like Chrome did (longer stick), or that building some sort of retrieval device requires setting it up at the site itself which still can cause accidents like slipping off while assembling it. Also, there are no tall supports to hold a pulley at a place where the gas probably renders anything nearby lifeless, compared to when there are tonnes of trees for Senku to out the pulley on when saving Kohaku in the forest

Also, i had to edit my comment because i mixed you up with someone else who implied that gas masks can be replaced with just good distance, which i wholly disagree because that is not possible in the setting of the story."
585,"What are you envisaging with a stick? You can either do it with a stick and rope like you are fishing, or you can do it with the stick as a really long handle - but either means you have to have a stick long enough to cover the distance from the edge of the gas to either above the acid or to the acid itself. Sure beakers aren't super fragile, but at the end of this long janky contraption they are going to be taking some serious hits. Custom making a thicker one is just going to make the whole contraption even more unwieldy. I guess with a lot of time and effort they could make a fully blown crane with a greater than 10m reach, but that is far from simple.

A cart isn't really going to work either, because you have two problems - firstly the slope is clearly uneven, and it is very likely your cart is going to get stuck in a rut, the second is how you are going to get the actual sample. To do this you either have to wheel the whole contraption into the acid or create a contraption that allows you to get a sample from the edge. The former is likely to damage the cart, and given it doesn't look like there are any gentle slopes into the acid you are probably going to lose your cart in the pool. The later is hella complex - more complex than a simple gas mask.

I'm not saying there aren't any simple better options of how to do this, but this really strikes me as something that wouldn't work."
586,"> The former is likely to damage the cart, and given it doesn't look like there are any gentle slopes into the acid you are probably going to lose your cart in the pool.

Yes, hence the ""sacrificial"" part of the cart. The cart is only necessary to get it down to the pond, nothing is stopping you from just pulling it back up by the rope.

The problem that the cart gets around is being able to cross plateaus in the terrain whilst going downhill. Since the rope is taught on the way up, plateaus are no issue.

You can't push rope, you just have to get gravity to pull it for you, but pulling it up works fine and dandy

>but either means you have to have a stick long enough to cover the distance from the edge of the gas to either above the acid or to the acid itself

In what way? Why would you need a long stick if you do the fishing method? Have you seen a fishing rod before? They're not exactly insanely long.

All you need to do is get that acid-proof end into the edge of the lake, and then pull it up by the long rope."
587,"So you push the cart down the slope with a really long stick, then pull the beaker on its own back up the slope? So now the beaker is bouncing across the rocky ground as you pull it back with an open top? It might survive, but it isn't coming back with anything in it.

> In what way? Why would you need a long stick if you do the fishing method? Have you seen a fishing rod before? They're not exactly insanely long.

Fishing rods don't need to be insanely long, because when you are fishing you generally stand at the bank, not more than 10 meters away from the bank. You could conceivably cast the beaker in from more than 10 meters away with a decent length of wire, but if you aren't holding the up off the ground with something rigid you run into the open beaker bouncing across the ground problem again."
588,">So you push the cart down the slope with a really long stick, then pull the beaker on its own back up the slope? 

Wtf is it with you and long sticks?

What would be the point of the cart if you need to push it? The cart has wheels for the sake of maintaining momentum fed by gravity.

>So now the beaker is bouncing across the rocky ground as you pull it back with an open top? It might survive, but it isn't coming back with anything in it.

Or... Hear me out... You just pull it up fuckin slowly and gently mate. And just use a round bottom flask to reduce spillage instead of a standard beaker. You don't need it filled to the brim, because you can do this multiple times.

>Fishing rods don't need to be insanely long, because when you are fishing you generally stand at the bank, not more than 10 meters away from the bank.

And then you cast the line at least dozens of meters forwards. I'm starting to believe you actually dont know how fishing works.

>You could conceivably cast the beaker in from more than 10 meters away with a decent length of wire, but if you aren't holding the up off the ground with something rigid you run into the open beaker bouncing across the ground problem again.

""Bouncing across the ground"" only happens if you're a brute in pulling it up."
589,">What would be the point of the cart if you need to push it? The cart has wheels for the sake of maintaining momentum fed by gravity.

So we are envisaging just letting is careen down the slope and hope it makes it, doesn't break or lose the beaker on the way? I thought pushing it some how and controlling its decent with a rope would work better but with enough carts I'm sure the gung ho approach would work too.

>Or... Hear me out... You just pull it up fuckin slowly and gently mate. And just use a round bottom flask to reduce spillage instead of a standard beaker. You don't need it filled to the brim, because you can do this multiple times.

If the path to the acid was a smooth consistent slope, sure this might work, but it very clearly isn't. There are flat portions, uneven rocky portions and slopes at points. However carefully you pull the beakers or flask it is going to end up on its side at points. It also has a pretty solid chance of getting caught somewhere too.

> And then you cast the line at least dozens of meters forwards. 

I'm not quite sure how you feel this is relevant to your point? The fishing analogy has been stretched well past its breaking point. The ""fishing method"" was just something I used to help people picture the tip of the stick being above the flask with a rope pulling it up. If with don't have the stick above the flask and instead are throwing it forwards with only a short stick, why do we have the stick at all?"
590,"There are two key, fairly obvious reasons for why they went down themselves  


1) If there was a better solution he didn't think of it. Obviously.  


2) They are on a time budget. They can't spend forever rigging up some complex system for extracting acid at a great distance."
591,">1) If there was a better solution he didn't think of it. Obviously.  

THAT'S EXACTLY MY PROBLEM.

They are supposed to be super smart and yet they cant even think of something that I can come up with in 2 minutes, let alone actually sitting down and planning out something more complex. It completely breaks my suspension of disbelief when these supposedly smart characters suddenly act fuckin dumb.

>2) They are on a time budget. They can't spend forever rigging up some complex system for extracting acid at a great distance.

That time budget allows them to spend time making gas masks, but not rig up a system to lower in a flask with rope?

Their lives are more important than the time limit. They both only survived here because of plot armor, they both should be dead because of their stupidity."
592,"Point 2 is where I hard disagree personally. No time constraint at this point is worth their lives, they are WAY too valuable (and they know that). Developing a safe system is the only way to go, because even if they fail a few times, they can try again and again. Ruri is simply not worth the world's 2 scientists, their plan goes to shit at the moment they die trying some stupidly risky thing like this."
593,"Let's say we have the option to take this risk, or give up on saving Ruri. It is clear that these characters would try to save Ruri. Maybe YOU don't feel that way, but these characters wear their motivations on their sleeves, and they are clearly dead set on making this miracle drug before Ruri dies. Time is of the essence.

Literally the entire point of this arc is to save Ruri, so I am baffled why you think they should just not."
594,"I’m not saying they should not, I’m saying they should have done it in a safer way. They can do risky stuff from time to time, I know it’s necessary, but this was just dumb. Also, if they have time to do 3 gasmasks, they surely have time to make a crane/pulley system to collect the acid without all this drama"
595,"Reason 3 then

3) The sulfuric acid mission was pretty exciting, while your idea is probably the least interesting way they could possibly do it.

One aspect of good writing is knowing when to trade in logic for emotion. A story where they always make the optimal decision is both unrealistic and dull. I do think there is value in questioning their decision to make such a risky plan, but at the same time it exemplifies the passion they have for making this cure-all and saving Ruri, and so overall I look at it positively. The gas mask route is also nice because it builds upon their past inventions, like glass, and shows off the power of science really nicely."
596,">One aspect of good writing is knowing when to trade in logic for emotion. A story where they always make the optimal decision is both unrealistic and dull.

It's not about ""making the optimal decision"" it's the fact that it completely undermines their character traits. It is **NOT** good writing to establish characters with traits and then completely ignore them for no reason.

A brave character suddenly being cowardly for no reason is stupid.

An empathetic character suddenly being callous for no reason is stupid.

A hot-headed character suddenly making a calm calculated decision for no reason is stupid.

And these characters who are super smart not coming up with a better plan than a fucking suicide mission is S T U P I D.

They never even *tried* to justify it by saying ""oh, this is the only way we can get it in time"" they just hand waved it.

This episode felt like the writer was on a tight deadline and just needed to make some dumb drama however he could."
597,"I can't think of any crane system that could be useable probably in a month and probably several months if you want to avoid gas exposure totally. They have a short time deadline. Otherwise wrong ruler in Village as well it's game over as moving half way across Japan minimum to start over from scratch required to avoid contact with growing anti science group.
Yes there is drama involved you want a pure science rebuild you need to leave the enemy part out."
598,I never said anything about a crane
599,">Literally the entire point of this arc is to save Ruri, so I am baffled why you think they should just not.

Because senku could use the political advantage it would give him to then get more labourers in his kingdom.

He doesn't get those labourers if he's fuckin dead.

Senku doesn't and shouldn't care personally for Ruri, he doesn't know her.

Chome cares for her, but chrome literally only survived because of a deus ex machina. He should be fucking dead due to his superiority and then his death means no cure."
600,Your referring to a fairly serious crane system and probably months of building it. Anything smaller your still using the masks for and blowing of the gas off the lake and still eating up lots of time.
601,">So we are envisaging just letting is careen down the slope and hope it makes it, doesn't break or lose the beaker on the way? I thought pushing it some how and controlling its decent with a rope would work better but with enough carts I'm sure the gung ho approach would work too.

Yup, just tie it on to the cart. If the cart gets stuck or something, pull it back up, if the cart makes it, the rope tying it will be destroyed in the acid allowing you to pull it back up (because the rope to pull it back up never touches the acid)

>If the path to the acid was a smooth consistent slope, sure this might work, but it very clearly isn't. There are flat portions, uneven rocky portions and slopes at points. However carefully you pull the beakers or flask it is going to end up on its side at points. It also has a pretty solid chance of getting caught somewhere too.

Have you never seen a flask? Even if it is on its side it wont spill everything. Especially if you craft a design to be as low spillage as possible.

>The ""fishing method"" was just something I used to help people picture the tip of the stick being above the flask with a rope pulling it up. 

That's a crane

>If with don't have the stick above the flask and instead are throwing it forwards with only a short stick, why do we have the stick at all?

The ""stick"" is attached to the flask so that the flask can submerge without the rope touching the acid. You're the only one that was thinking about 10m sticks that the people would be holding on to."
602,"Making a rope that works could be tough, but considering the risk factor and the value of their lives for the world at that point I see no reason to just develop a rope system that works instead of doing this stupidly risky maneuver"
603,Time constraints they don't have the time.
604,they could have made a glass jar with a long glass handle tied to the pole that would allow them to dip it into the lake without the rope getting close
605,"I'm guessing the acid would have dissolved the rope much in the same way it dissolved the bird. Notice when they were scooping it, the only part that went into the acid was the glass.

I expected them to rig up some kind of pulley system too though, I feel like Senku being who he is wouldn't place anyone at that kind of risk."
606,"A lot of people are saying no rope due to the acid potentially melting it. That's a good point but my answer is simpler. 

It's the same reason Senku needed two people to perfectly spin the discs of the generator at the same speed instead of just using pulleys or gears. 

The same reason he had so much trouble making the distillery.

The same reason he needed a handful of people using simple bamboo pumps instead of one person spinning a [forge blower with a bow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVV4xeWBIxE).

Senku is a scientist, not an engineer. The kingdom of science really needs to find an engineer."
607,That was a neat video. It really puts things into perspective. All of Senku's solutions are not the most convenient after all.
608,"It is also nice to point out they could make sulfuric acid with sulfur and potassium nitrate, both of which they already have.  
 [https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/projects/acid/](https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/projects/acid/) 

The first way to do large scale production of sulfuric acid, btw/"
609,"Very good point and with Clay working Senku has defiantly had to relearn some of the art. 
Yep they need an engineer."
610,Probably because the rope would have dissolved?
611,Big ass steel rod then.
612,[Laughing Sulfy-chan.jpg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV1QZ9pswS4)
613,"Steel wool isn't really a good representative of a metal bar vs acid reaction, it is usually specifically used in these types of demonstrations because the huge surface area it has makes for a really fast reaction."
614,"Wait, what purity of sulfuric acid would be present in lake water like this?"
615,Enough to dissolve a bird
616,"Acids react with metals, releasing hydrogen."
617,"It's not instant though. I'm not a material scientist so I don't know how long it would take for atmospheric sulfuric acid to erode an iron bar but I feel you can get a few scoops from a safe elevation to transfer to another glass container before the iron rod loses integrity.

It's not an ideal situation, but safer than risking your life with primitive gas masks on an unstable surface.

(Plus if we're gonna get pedantic we could talk about how that wooden spear does NOT have the integrity to keep Chrome above the pool so Chrome would have just straight up died when the wood snapped.)"
618,"Guys, Tsukasa Saitama'd a fucking lion.

I think we can stop overthinking certain things when the science is still legit."
619,"Yeah everyone's thinking too deeply into something so simple, like is THIS where you draw the line, and not when they fucking made prescription glasses with nothing but bamboo and some sand? 

I think the only realistic part of this show is how they show the science and teach people about different chemicals and what not, but the execution of it all is totally not realistic in anyway. And honestly, I kind of think people should just be okay with that, because if Dr.Stone went any further with any of the science stuff it would just turn into a boring documentary."
620,"> it would just turn into a boring documentary.

And here we see the Senku in it's natural habitat, perusing colorful stones.

Oh, what is this? This shiny clear dust has caught it's eye. It must be an exhilarating experience for this young Senku, to find such a valuable finite resource.

Alas, a wild Tsukasa appears on the ledge. It surveys the territory that it thinks it is is. It spots the Senku, and beings to approach.

This. This is the cruelty of nature. There is a 10 billion percent chance of conflict."
621,"The problem wasn't the fact that they were doing unrealistic stuff, just that this was a dumb and very complicated solution to a problem that could be easily solved by just keeping distance"
622,"Except it wasn't complicated at all? Y'all are acting like Senku made this giant contraption to get the sulfuric acid, when really he just tied a glass jar to a stick. 

If anyone is coming up with dumb, needlessly complicated solutions to a simple problem, it's you guys."
623,"Bro I’m saying he SHOULD have just done something like tie a glass jar to a (longer) stick, which would eliminate the need for a gas mask AND the ridiculous risk of death"
624,"The show did this to add stakes and tension, plus them doing it that way would've been super boring. It also gave the show an excuse to explain what gas masks are and how they work. It is a show bent on teaching people about science, so it makes sense to talk about the many ways people protect themselves against poisons in an episode centered around sulfuric acid.

Also I'm pretty sure just making a longer stick wouldn't have worked due to the fact that that stick would have to be hella strong and not be  flimsy or else the minute they dip it into the lake it would break off. And there's nothing all that interesting about watching Senku dip a large stick into a poisonous lake, it's way more entertaining seeing him go about it in a more complicated way, because that leads to drama.

And making the gas masks just makes more sense given that Senku has the resources to do it, I mean now that he has gas masks he doesn't HAVE to think of other ways to get dangerous chemicals because now it's easier.  Which means in future episodes the characters don't have to waste time thinking up complicated solutions to what is an easy problem in our world. 

That's kind of the whole point of each new invention Senku makes, to make things easier for himself in the future so he can keep on advancing until he gets humanity back to where they were. 

I get that yes there was probably a simpler solution to the problem, but that's not actually the point of the show and it's science."
625,"You can't avoid the masks with a stick you have to stay a great distance from the lake to avoid needing masks as a slight bit of wind the gas moves out a bit. You need a huge Crane Type contraption, Road Work and tons of labor to move it to not use Masks.
They needed something that could be done in a day or two."
626,"You do know that you're giving this anime way to much credit, like it's not realistic at all, you guys are thinking to deeply into this."
627,"Nah man, it's totally science based, it's [the quick twitch muscles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h5kg5f8Im0&feature=youtu.be&t=1m6s)."
628,Metal is hard and strong though.
629,You still have secure the bottle to the rod
630,"Completely trivial, literally just hook it on and then close the loop"
631,Make a bottle with an indentation just below the top ([like this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a2/4b/0b/a24b0b260bf1b752f506c78f66532517.jpg)) where you then secure a metal loop; attach the loop to the rod with a hinge.
632,That actually probably would've worked a lot better.
633,Or make a glass bottle with a handle and lower the bottle in at an angle.
634,They don't have steel.
635,"It took them a long time to get the iron they had, and it'd have to be if considerable length to completely avoid danger"
636,"Make a glass chain and beaker hoster?

Didn't we just get a master craftsman?"
637,"Yeah, it made for some good dramatic scenes, but I kept wondering why they could't have made some sort of pulley system or even just attached a bunch sticks together and used it to get the acid. 

And yes, the acid and gas has the chance to dissolve ropes and sticks, but not any more than human skin."
638,"A pulley system was my first thought as well. Or a kind of crane would have done the job too.

The gas mask thing was just done for drama, not because it was the smart thing to do."
639,"To have a pulley system, you have to construct the pulley system at the site itself, which means near that dangerous lake full of gas. It was also easier to do back when Senku saved Kohaku because it was in a forest with a tall tree to hold the pulley in place. In this case, they are in an acid bowl.  


You'll eventually still get to the conclusion that gas masks are needed after all for the sulfuric acid collection. I personally don't understand why anyone thinks gas masks can be replaced by something else when the target is obvioulsy poisonous gas, something a gas mask is intended for."
640,"> To have a pulley system, you have to construct the pulley system at the site itself, which means near that dangerous lake full of gas.

This is not an issue. They were pretty close to the lake, without any side effects, before making gas masks.

> It was also easier to do back when Senku saved Kohaku because it was in a forest with a tall tree to hold the pulley in place. In this case, they are in an acid bowl.

Then make a crane, like I said. You only need a counterweight then."
641,"It was only because the spear alerted them that Kohaku could save Kinro before the gas killed them. That does not mean they did not need gas masks. What i am trying to say is that making a pulley system at the site itself is equallu dangerous and likely that they could fall like Chrome did, and died while building that pulley because of a rock slipping. And should someone fall without gas masks, it is immediate death. The episode established that the accident can happen regardless what precaution was taken.

I am not sure what kind of crane you are talking about in this case, because what i mean is that you need a good tall support to be able to hold a pulley in place while still being able to let the rope rotate - a counterwight cannot act as a pulley support in thay regard. That acidic lake is so poisonous there were probably no tall structures like trees nearby for you to put a pulley in place, so the onoy conclusion i could drae from your idea is a few people need to act as ""part of the crane"" to pull things up, which if they slip oike Chrome did, more people would likely die than the episode we watched.

And if you are talking about an automated crane, electricity was barely made. That is not possible with the current conditions they were in."
642,I don't think normal rope will last in acid.
643,But Bamboo gasmask are cool and egdy
644,Is everyone going to ignore the fact that you would smell that gas from a mile away? The same gas forms when eggs go bad.
645,"If you read other replies, they mentioned that when the concentration is high enough, you are unable to detect any rotten smell at all. It's the reason why gas accidents happen more likely at higher concentrations of hydrogen sulfide."
646,I love this show!
647,Are we just going to ignore how strong is Ginro? Just like.... *Really* strong? XD
648,He ain't a bodyguard for nothing.
649,Theres a manga exclusive scene where Kohaku ranked their fighting levels. This is after the sorcery battle
650,I'm guess we're getting a new opening and ending?  I'm gonna miss that ending song after every episode.
651,Am I the only one who thought that sulfuric acid-chan was hot?
652,Checkout the manga version for a detailed version
653,The personification of the Sulfuric acid lake was a nice touch.
654,"Really enjoy this show overall, but sometimes it falls into tiring shonen tropes. Ginro, for example, is painfully annoying.  I hope he gets better, because his screentime so far has been mostly yelling, ogling, and emo facial distortion."
655,Some of the best moments are with Ginro i assure you
656,"He essentially stays the same, but you'll grow to like him lol"
657,What was that song during the last part of the episode? It was awesome!
658,"It’s awesome to see they put in so much work to adapt Boichi’s art, because Sulfur-chan was some of my favorite art in the manga (ch. 30-32). Too many adaptations fail to capture their manga’s original style and end up looking generic, like Tokyo Ghoul."
659,How come in the anime chrome doesn’t say “baaaad” like he does in the manga ?
660,This show is great so far coz it has character development & arcs even for seemingly minor characters.It was nice to see more of Kohaku's backstory & Kinro's development.
661,"Senku being team Dad yet again.

Man it never stops being a treat to watch this. I've already read all of the manga but I love seeing how it's adapted each week."
662,Sulfy best girl
663,Turning down Kohaku as Wife smh
664,"Oh, that ghostbusters reference"
665,"Just a pointer.

There are easier ways to acquire sulfuric acid. For those that come here looking for science, you can make it by combining sulfur with potassium nitrate(saltpeter) both of which they already have, and exposing the resulting gas to a chamber with water.

 [https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/projects/acid/](https://cavemanchemistry.com/oldcave/projects/acid/) 

The process used in the anime was dangerous and chosen to heighten the tension and provide a reason for character development, both of which are perfectly good excuses, but for those wondering I thought I would mention the lead chamber process."
666,Nice informative link!
667,Tldr senku is an idiot savant?
668,Of all the things that could have survived from the modern era I'm glad thigh highs are one of them. Sulfy-chan is definitely best girl material with gams like that!
669,"Haven't finished the episode yet but why not tie a rope to a bucket and throw it?  
Guess the rope might melt."
670,Rope will melt
671,Because it's a ten meter throw and the bucket (and the rope) would melt? Plus you would also lose most (if not all) of what you got after dragging the bucket back.
672,They can't carry the acid in a bucket because it would eat through the wood.  That's why they use glass jars.
673,"Sulfuric acid melts a lot of metals, and a glass bucket probably wouldn't survive such a rough collection method."
674,https://youtu.be/N3xyICmQHy8
675,"Yeah, please don't play around with chemicals unless you know what you're doing. This guy is a moron."
676,"Interesting video, but an absurdly and stupidly dangerous thing to do if you are not sure what you are dealing with."
677,"The sulfuric acid representation was really terrifying but i feel like the sky light blue palette didnt screamed ""dangerous"" nor ""deadly""."

681,"I feel like sulfuric acid is not this dangerous and seems like a overestimation unless literally ingested...

To not be able to breathe in the fumes at all and dying instantly? Yea I doubt thats the case. It would probably cause irritation and inflammation of the mucosa in your nose and what not but for someone to die immediately?

And if they dont die immediately I feel like they easily could have made thick gloves and ran up grabbed some acid into their glass jars and then ran back out and would have been fine. This isnt some like anthrax/Cyanide gas type thing where its super toxic its a natural substance. I dunno it seems kind of over rexaggerated where it seemed silly. Although I am not 100% sure how severe sulfuric acid can be when breathed in..."
682,"The thing they're worried about isn't sulfuric acid but [hydrogen sulfide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide). It's naturally occurring, heavier than air, and concentrations above 500ppm can result in immediate unconsciousness and death."
683,Ohhh I didn't catch that. Cool didn't know about that
684,This is why you should not skip science class
685,Lel
686,Hydrogen Sulfide my man. It very much is a thing that exists.
687,"Looked up the medical aspect of this because I was curious, and yea I dont think this was remotely accurate.

Sulfuric acid has to be heated / misted in order for it to even be a danger as a aerosol. Lets assume it was heated in this case though. Even then with such a small dose they would get if they just ran up and filled up a jar or two with acid, at most it would just cause irritation. With more severe cases like chronic exposure/high degree of exposure the way Sulfuric acid works is it causes release of water from cells and so fluid can accumulate in the lungs and cause pulmonary edema.

Just interesting stuff I found when looking it up."
688,Sulfuric acid wasn't the the only hazard. The atmosphere was also full of hydrogen sulfide which is extremely toxic to inhale.
689,"the sulfuric acid is not the aerial threat they’re worried about, it’s hydrogen sulfide gas which is heavier than air and pools in these kinds of dips"
690,"Solid episode but the one thing I wasn't sure about was teasing Chrome's death like that, the wide shot didn't show Ginro whatsoever and for a science anime it felt a little too crazy to have Ginro show up out of nowhere, react that quickly without stabbing Chrome and then hold chrome up from the other side of a spear. I could understand if it was a Jojo character like Tsukasa but it just kinda seemed too superhuman for Ginro. It would have been better if they didn't show Chrome quite so far away from the edge when he was falling imo."
691,"i was really underwhelmed with this episode. The animation and sound are absolutely okay, but the story felt somehow odd this time. putting more than one person in danger was flat out stupid, why didnt they make the gasmasks before (afterall it IS an essential ingredient anyway), before sending ginro ahead saying ""you have 0.1 seconds to react or youre dead."". Old dude making ""accidentally"" another set and the ""walking way letting it just lie there"" was really odd. i really liked the depiction (hope thats the right word) of sulfy-chan, seemingly beeing pretty and very deadly, but grino beeing ""charmed"" into death... cmon. 

Thing is, thats not everything in this episode where i was kinda taken out of the ""immersion"", and i dont mind with a 2-3 in an episode, but this one was really weak in comparison."
692,"Kaseki gave Ginrou a lecture about fear and courage, and very obviously made a big deal of “woah! I made an extra gas mask! Totally by accident!” Because he was trying to make a point to Ginrou that he should have been with them at the pond, because if he didn’t go then he was all talk. It was intentional"

Hydrochloric acid is stomach acid, which would be very unpleasant to harvest and refine, but not impossible.  It would involve a lot of vomiting, but far less deadly gas."
698,That sounds terrible and painful
699,So does poison gas and falling in a pool of sulphuric acid.
700,The problem would be isolating it. Stomach acid would also be too dilute to be useful afaik.
701,"It’s not hard to reduce a dilute solution to increase the molarity.  After all, they already did it with the alcohol when they were making the miracle water.  Of course that same setup wouldn’t be able to stand up to a concentrated acid, but they also have access to glassware which can stand up to powerful acids."

719,"Why did they make gas masks?

Wouldn't it be, like, 10 billion percent easier to just make a long breathing tube and a pump?"
720,"It seems like a fairly comparable amount of effort (seriously, the gas masks aren't that complicated), but a lot more can go wrong with a long breathing tube and a pump vs. a self-contained apparatus like a gas mask.

Fall down a ledge beyond the range of the tube (Just like what happened to Chrome)?  You're dead.  The pump breaks? You're dead.  Someone trips over the tube and unplugs it?  You're dead.  A drop of acid causes a leak to develop somewhere along the line (just like what happened to Senku)? You're dead if you can't find the leak quickly, and now you're looking for it along a 40-foot hose instead of a 3-foot hose."
721,"To add to what Plutonium said, the pipe thing would make a lot more sense if they were going to be hanging out for a long time in a hostile environment, hours or more, but yeah, if they can be in and out in a few minutes, the gas mask might make more sense, due to it's flexibility."
722,"I'm surprised he didn't make a pipe that takes it uphill. Sure it will require manpower, but it's better than risking it."
723,Or a really long hose with suction mechanism
724,"What's stopping them from harnessing the poisonous gas and using it as a weapon to kill Tsukasa? There's not way he could detect it right? And it's not like he's immune.

Why couldn't they make a longer stick to fetch the acid from the pool."
729,Omg this episode is so good!
730,Chrome is the best
731,I never understood why they didn't just tie a rope to a jug and just throw the jug into the lake and put it out with the rope. They never really needed to get near the poison gas.
732,"Considering what happened to Senku's gas mask, I assume the rope would melt from the sulfuric acid."
733,"I mean, even if he needed to make a chain made of glass instead of a rope, which realisticly he wouldn't, wouldn't that be better than risking both of their lives?"
734,"That sounds absurdly difficult to make. Also, if you look it up, these pools are really big, and the way to it is pretty bumpy, so not only would it need to be really long, the water would probably spill out before they got it out of the danger zone."
735,"Compared to all of the other creations, a chain made of glass would be ridiculously easy. Take a foot or so long stick of glass and melt one end and belt it into a loop. Take another stick and repeat to hook it onto that loop. Twenty or so more times and you have a chain that is resistant to any concentration of sulfuric acid. As for it spilling, Senku would certainly be able to devise something that would be able to keep most of the acid it when it's being pulled. Do you have links for the information about the geography locations?"
736,I have no idea. I just searched up acid valley on google images.
737,"Well, I guess Hakone is too far away and only has Sulfur, not sulfuric acid. Not sure how to make the acid from just Sulfur anyway... and it serves as a plot point too. Character building"
738,"Senku can make a pulley system to pull up a tree and then convert that pulley system into a downhill car and yet he can't find *any* better way to get the acid than literally walking up next to it and scooping it out with a beaker on a stick?

That's a tad too far on the forced drama for me this episode.

So many different ways he could rig up a system to collect it from a safe distance.

Literally just tie a rope to the end of the stick and lower it down the slope. 

Or a metal rod. 

Or if there are flat sections to get past, make a sacrificial wheeled cart that will take it in and then you can pull it back up.

Or make a significant section of the container's handle from acid-proof material and just throw it into the lake and pull it back out.

They could even build some sort of wooden jetty out from a high point so that they can be closer to the lake while keeping good height for casting out a container and having cleaner air.

If they're so worried about safety, there is no way they would not think of some sort of safer alternative.

The show is just completely ignoring the charaters' intelligence and ability to problem solve and come up with a properly safe method just for the sake of pushing drama."
739,"
>Senku can make a pulley system to pull up a tree and then convert that pulley system into a downhill car and yet he can't find any better way to get the acid than literally walking up next to it and scooping it out with a beaker on a stick?

Haven't you see there is no vegetation around the pond? 

>That's a tad too far on the forced drama for me this episode.


I agree


>Literally just tie a rope to the end of the stick and lower it down the slope

They don't have rattan woods, common lignin fibers would just turn to carbon.

>Or a metal rod

That's just too laborous man. 

>Or if there are flat sections to get past, make a sacrificial wheeled cart that will take it in and then you can pull it back up.

I don't get this.


>They could even build some sort of wooden jetty out from a high point so that they can be closer to the lake while keeping good height for casting out a container and having cleaner air.

Again I can't follow you here. 

>If they're so worried about safety, there is no way they would not think of some sort of safer alternative.

They're worried about safety but do they have the luxury to waste their most precious resource-- time and lose it in gathering more unnecessary materials?"
740,"The wheeled cart is if the beaker gets stuck on some rock or terrain when you're trying to lower the supposed beaker-on-metal rod-off-rope from a safe spot, the wheel can just roll down the slope and across some bumps.


Look up a jetty on google, he's saying build a platform that sticks out from the top to stand on. But eh, seems like it would take some engineering to even get started.


If they're short on time the big brain play here would be to postpone the fight by wooing the village head or something, I guess someone like Gen would've been able to do it by making some festival or a show lol."
741,">Haven't you see there is no vegetation around the pond? 

Because no vegetation in the direct vicinity stops it from being possible? You can collect and move resources...

>They don't have rattan woods, common lignin fibers would just turn to carbon.

Any complaint about the material also applies to the method they used. They had a glass beaker tied to a stick, if that works, then tying a rope to the end of that stick for extra reach will work equally fine.

>That's just too laborous man. 

And making 3 gas masks isn't.

You can't say ""that""s too laborous man"" when they needed good luck and then a deus ex machina just to survive the current method.

""Man I'm lazy, I'm just going to gamble with my life instead, because that is what a character known for hard work, intelligence and ingenuity would do""

>I don't get this.

You can't lower something down on rope if there are plateaus in the terrain. Hence the wheeled cart.

>They're worried about safety but do they have the luxury to waste their most precious resource-- time and lose it in gathering more unnecessary materials?

1. They already had to waste a heap of time making gas masks to get close

2. Their most precious resource is their lives and knowledge. No point being fast if you're dead and can't finish.

They knew that this method was **SUPER** dangerous and we saw proof in this episode twice that they could easily die. There is no reason not to try alternative safer methods as simple as ""tie a rope and lower it down""."
742,"As much as what we see at the end is a beaker of sulfuric acid, that's not all that Senku went there for, the section you see with Chrome telling him about the damage to his hose has them collecting some sort of sediment with hand tools."
743,">Literally just tie a rope to the end of the stick and lower it down the slope.

See the episode again, it's not a free fall to the ""water"", a rope would be useless.

 

>Or a metal rod.

&#x200B;

A 10 meter metal rod, that's totally usable for delicate work.

&#x200B;

>Or if there are flat sections to get past, make a sacrificial wheeled cart that will take it in and then you can pull it back up.

&#x200B;

What about when it gets struck? Also, how do you get container back? Any rope tied to it would melt and even if it didn't I don't think bouncing off a glass container all the way back wouldn't damage it.

&#x200B;

 

>They could even build some sort of wooden jetty out from a high point so that they can be closer to the lake while keeping good height for casting out a container and having cleaner air.

That would requier the to work clsoe to the lake. While the gas is heavier than air that doesn't mean it is safe to do stuff there. PLus it is very debatable if they can even buld something like that on that ground."
744,">What about when it gets struck? 

Then pull it up and try again

>Also, how do you get container back? Any rope tied to it would melt

Mate, why do you keep talking about the rope melting?

They literally had the rope **DIPPED IN** the acid in this episode. But apparently getting the rope close and not even **IN** the acid is too unbelievable for you?

Wtf are you talking about?

>if it didn't I don't think bouncing off a glass container all the way back wouldn't damage it.

Just pull it up gently mate, glass beakers don't break for nothing. And you could just make thick glass or a metal shell for the glass to absorb some of the sharp impacts.

>A 10 meter metal rod, that's totally usable for delicate work.

1. This isn't delicate work, spillage doesn't matter if there is no one to be spillled on.

2. It doesn't need to be 10m long, if you have a shorter metal rod attached to a rope, you could literally throw the metal part into the acid, not have the rope touch, and then pull the whole thing up with rope.

>That would requier the to work clsoe to the lake. While the gas is heavier than air that doesn't mean it is safe to do stuff there. PLus it is very debatable if they can even buld something like that on that ground.

They can obviously get close by *some* distance. They dont need to build it right up to the edge, any advantage is good for them when casting out their rope."

Please evidence of this? Because I jsut rewatched the episode and that never happens. They especially made it so that the part tied with the rope wouldn't touch the acid, as you see [here](https://i.imgur.com/SX3quL8.png). Notice how the glass handle is tied far away from where it would need to submerge to get the acid inside the flask, *mate*?

>Just pull it up gently mate, glass beakers don't break for nothing. And you could just make thick glass or a metal shell for the glass to absorb some of the sharp impacts.

You are still dragging a glass (and probably not quality glass at that) container through a rock slope. Nevermind that is an open one and the acid would spill.

1. Except that it doesn't matter, the point is to gether that acid, not to lose all of it on the way up.
2. Says who? [Did you look at the distance to  the ""water""](https://i.imgur.com/TsIu6zJ.png)? Or were you busy with your r/imverysmart tirade?

They can obviously get close by *some* distance. They dont need to build it right up to the edge, any advantage is good for them when casting out their rope.

Here you are fully especulating. This is the typical assumptions made by people who bitch abut ""why didn't they do X when *I* totally could?"" only because something isn't spelled out as unseless/impossible doesn't mean you have to assume it si completely doable."

If you think getting the rope [this](https://i.imgur.com/FmfMFBM.jpg) close to the acid is fine, but my method where the rope is not even close to touching the acid is not, then you're fucking crazy.

>You are still dragging a glass (and probably not quality glass at that) container through a rock slope. Nevermind that is an open one and the acid would spill.

Not if you just use a round bottom flask with a very narrow neck, you can reduce spillage by a lot. Using a standard beaker is not the only option.

>Except that it doesn't matter, the point is to gether that acid, not to lose all of it on the way up.

Again, easy to do with a proper flask.

Mate, I'm not here to try and show off how smart I am. My problem is that they completely fuckin undermined the traits of these characters by making them go on some completely unnecessary suicide mission despite both being established as having the intelligence and ingenuity to think of a better way.

These ideas I literally came up with off the top of my head, I didn't think for more than a minute about them, and yet they are still relatively viable. 

There are more complex plans I haven't thought of that would also be preferable to a fuckin suicide mission.

They only survived with their lives because of plot armour, their plan was fucking stupid and they both should be dead."
747,"> Bigger wheels


So they need to make some kind of giantic cart and drag it for kilometers of mountain and then lose it the first time and *maybe* get what they want. Totally viable.

>If you think getting the rope this close to the acid is fine, but my method where the rope is not even close to touching the acid is not, then you're fucking crazy.

Eh, yes? It *isn't* touching the acid. If you think it is then look again.

>Not if you just use a round bottom flask with a very narrow neck, you can reduce spillage by a lot. Using a standard beaker is not the only option.

A flask that will easily get stuck everywhere?

Or maybe it is because the geography of the area and their avaliable tools made your ideas impractical? Assuming you know better than the people actually there while only having a rough understanding of what's happening isn't the wisest thing to do."
748,">So they need to make some kind of giantic cart and drag it for kilometers of mountain and then lose it the first time and *maybe* get what they want. Totally viable.

Lmao, who said gigantic? You're really trying pretty hard here to misrepresent my arguments to make them sound worse than they are. It's almost as if you can't come up with any real counterpoints.

>Eh, yes? It *isn't* touching the acid. If you think it is then look again.

Please read what I actually said before replying.

**In the show, they get the rope at least almost to touching the acid, but you say that my plan of getting the rope *not even that close* would make it melt**

>A flask that will easily get stuck everywhere?

Lmao, you really are trying just **so** hard to come up with incredibly stupidly thought out downsides, huh?

How the fuck can it get stuck mate? It's not like the mountainside is made of downward facing hooks. If it comes across a rock, you can just pull it over or around, it's not fucking rocket science mate.

>Or maybe it is because the geography of the area and their avaliable tools made your ideas impractical? 

Except that you've done an absolutely terrible job of ""disproving"" my ideas. All you've done is misrepresent my arguments to try and make them sound less viable than they are because you're desperate to fit your preconceived notions rather than have an actual fucking conversation.

>Assuming you know better than the people actually there while only having a rough understanding of what's happening isn't the wisest thing to do.

Are you forgetting that these aren't real people? They were made by a writer at his desk. If there was no other viable way to achieve the goal, then the writer needs to *show* that, not just expect the audience to assume it given absolutely 0 evidence.

It just reeks of a writer on a tight deadline trying to force some drama into the story and hand wave any inconsistencies with the characters' personality."
749,"You are actually right, I didn't think of this way while watching. Also you don't deserve the downvotes. These are very valid points. Whiteknighting the franchise will not change it..."
750,"They're on an empty rock slope trying to collect a substance that will eat through literally anything they have except glass.

Building a 50-meter metal contraption might be a viable option, but I can only image how much longer that would take over just creating several cloth gas masks."
751,"1. They literally dip their wood and rope contraptions into the acid in this episode

2. They both almost died in this episode, the risk of their method was WAY too high. Not only are there very simple methods that could have made it safer, but even more complicated ones would have been much better than straight up gambling with their lives."
752,But .. but ..bamboo Gasmask = cool
753,I just wish it could be cool without undermining the established traits of these characters i.e intelligence and ingenuity.
754,"even if they did that, there would still be a need for gas masks in order to effectively use the acid for the chemistry needed for the drug"
755,"Sure, gas masks are fine, the problem is them massively risking their lives by going near the lake."
756,"I'll believe in the mangaka and animators and try to rationalise their thinking:
The area surrounding the lake looked very uneven and delicate so building a whole machine near it to carefully drag the acid would be out of question. Most people bring the argument of using a rope or a long stick to scoop the acid from a safe distance but they forget that the glass he made is a super fragile one using basic quartz sand, nothing like the one we make today, not mentionning that any rope used would be made with plant or animal material which will just melt on contact. Lastly would be using some kind of long metal stick that doesn't react to the acid, noble metals that is but considering te circumstances, I doubt they would have access to such materials in enough quantities to do such a trick."
757,"Why did they have to make gas masks and risks their lives?

Why not attach a (metal, like iron) rope to a bottle throw it in, let it fill up, and pull it back in?"
758,"Um, [what](https://i.imgur.com/g3qDK2m.png)?

The silver spear started turning black way more than 0.1 seconds before Kohaku pulled the dumbass to safety. Why is he still alive?

Is hydrogen sulfide really so instakill that you die after breathing into it without any screams or thrashing around or anything?

Why couldn't Senku just rig up some contraption to get the sulfuric acid from safety? Hell, all he needs is a bottle with a top that's rigged to close and some acid-resistant rope.

Senku's hose had a hole in it when he wrapped it up. Why didn't any of the superinstantdeadlygas get inside in the meantime? Or did it and was still neutralized?

Why did it take so long for the spear to turn fully black the second time when it was right next to the lake of acid?"
759,"> The silver spear started turning black way more than 0.1 seconds before Kohaku pulled the dumbass to safety. Why is he still alive?

Manga time. :) It's at least better than the One Piece episodes where they have ""five minutes to do a thing"" and end up taking eight+ full episodes. Plus he may have been exaggerating slightly anyway.

>Is hydrogen sulfide really so instakill that you die after breathing into it without any screams or thrashing around or anything?

What difference would that make anyway? It's not like they could heal back from it even if it did take a bit longer to kill. If they're exposed, they die.

>Why did it take so long for the spear to turn fully black the second time when it was right next to the lake of acid?

Dramatic license."
760,"> What difference would that make anyway? It's not like they could heal back from it even if it did take a bit longer to kill. If they're exposed, they die.

I was referring to the story about the professor who knelt and instantly died and his students were non the wiser until they checked on him."
761,">Is hydrogen sulfide really so instakill that you die after breathing into it without any screams or thrashing around or anything?

In high concentrations, yes. I don't know much about the dangers of places like that but it I couldn't find much info about even what would be the normal concentration found around lakes like that I sort of doubt it's high enough to be instantly deadly but maybe it can be.

As for making some kind of contraption - I'm guessing the location has a big part, it didn't look like an easy place to reach. It looks very much like [Ijen](https://youtu.be/MW86gAzQH3g?t=104), you can imagine by looking at the video how hard it would be to bring stuff to a place like this"
762,"> As for making some kind of contraption - I'm guessing the location has a big part, it didn't look like an easy place to reach.

Acid-resistant rope tied to a container.  Throw from safety, then real in.  Literally 0 risk as long as the lake doesn't decide to emit a large bubble of deadly gas while they're doing it."

764,"It's never confirmed the princess has TB. Since they can't possibly know, it's best to try antibiotics first."
765,"I'm not going to pretend that this show is completely realistic, but acid lakes exist and are commonly found near [hot springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur#Natural_occurrence) in places like Sicily or around the Pacific Ring of Fire (of which Japan's volcanic systems form part of). The biggest one in the world is in [Ijen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijen), Indonesia. After 3000 years, the terrain probably wouldn't change that much for one of such size to form in Japan, but that's where the irrealism kicks in.

Yeah, they're blind now.

Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection, and sulfa drugs are mostly antibacterial, afaik. Seems like some are antiviral too, TIL."
766,"Sulfa drugs don't work on TB, but assuming that's what she has is flawed from the start. We simply don't know at this point.

The process to creating the sulfa drugs also invents a lot more 'tech trees' that Senku requires in the future anyway so of course this is plenty beneficial for him.

Also, they're not blind. It's not concentrated enough to cause anything except irritation."
767,"I meant as in its justa  tiny bit too convenient, and Sulfa drugs have a very limited effect over Tuberculosis, due to its slow reproductive cycle, the first antibiotic that was truly effective was Streptomycin, still  only using compound  treatment with 4 AB during  a months long treatment one can cure TB,   what bothers me is this ""selective  treatment""  they could have gone with a  generic infection, they had to go with blood coughing disease.  and yet couldn't be bothered to learn what technology you really need to cure it."
768,"I mean, we don't know if it's tuberculosis.

Anyhow, thanks, I didn't know that."
769,"Its the only disease that fits with those symptoms and could be cured by AB,   thats why I say "" selective realism"" its just slightly realistic enough that gives me an uncanny valley of sorts in which it just infuriates me  because its so inaccurate,  I'd rather they use magic healing powers."
770,There are multiple of respiratory diseases that fit currently known symptoms. TB is just the most famous of them since it is one of the few chronic infections that have survived in the age of vaccination and antibiotics. Heck it could be cystic fibrosis for all we know.
771,And that wouldn't  be cured with Sulfa either.
772,"Oh I am well aware. All that I was suggesting is that we have some very generic symptoms that can apply to a wide variety of disorders. No matter what the aliment is, secondary bacterial infections are always a likely occurrence and many times are more lethal than the primary respiratory disease itself."
773,"Most bacteria are either gram positive or gram negative and different drugs work on each. The bacteria that causes TB is an exception, being neither gram positive or negative and only specialized antibiotics work on it."
