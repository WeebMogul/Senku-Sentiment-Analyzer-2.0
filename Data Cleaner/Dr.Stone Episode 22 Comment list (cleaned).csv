1,Is the part with Yuzuhira and Taiju just a tease in the OP? Because we have two episodes and it just seems ridiculous to think they will get that far. I just don't see it. So it's just teasing a second season right?
2,Yep.
3,Yep.
4,"For those wishing to read the source, today's episode covered the entirety of Ch. 56."
5,Oh my god it's gonna end on 60. Hell yes.
6,Really hope so.      The scene in the manga made me tear up.    Pretty sure I'm going to cry my eyes out when it's animated.
7,I just wanna see petrification island and ibarra animated
8,Heres hoping for season 2 then! Would love to see Ryusui too!
9,"facts bro, buy the blu rays"
10,The real gems were the friends we made along the way!
11,...    What are you even talking about? That's so cringy.
12, Chrome demands a rewind 
13,TFW real life conversations don't have save points and redos.
14,"Dammit Sothis, let me use divine pulse when I screw up tea time!"
15,HAGANAI references are always fun.
16,"Ah, when life is not as predictable as a visual novel ;"
17,The real gem is also the Mentalist surprise for Senku!
18,Just had to make sure this was in the comments.
19,I like how they use the word cringe frequently in this episode.
20, Steven Universe/Land of the Lustrous intensifies 
21,Why you cringy?
22,the greatest treasure
23,magma just went full tsundere
24,And Chrome went deredere.
25,Bakagma
26,How do I delete this image from my memories
27,How do I delete reddit and delete myself
28,"Idk about Reddit, but the second part shouldn't be too hard"
29,"Today I shall die, and I shall take u/Shiro_Kai with me."
30,B-but what about that thread from yesterday?!
31,I really wanna come up with a good reply but I have no idea what you're talking about.
32,"Oof, right in the friendship you probably formed in that thread."
33,I uh... is this some sort of joke I'm too stupid to understand?
34,Either that or I'm just awful at telling jokes.
35,"There was an /r/askreddit thread yesterday about ""what if you killed yourself a year ago what would you have missed out on this year?"""
36,"Ah, yes. I'd have missed out on today's dinner."
37,"""Today you, tomorrow me""?"
38,Thank you for your service
39,"Just follow mecha senkus instruction, only replace water with exhaust fumes."
40,What the fuck
41,"""I don't care anymore. It doesn't change the fact that I was going to kill you!""     Uso de aru.      This man was so happy that began striking the rock for no reason! "
42,yep
43,Magma lifts Senku up to launch him out of the cold water    Me: Character development for Magma yaay    My sister: heehee Magma can see Senku's underwear
44,Joke's on your sister. Senku is no pantsu.
45,That's what I told her lol
46,So did she do the pout face or the surprised face?
47,Ahegao
48,Dear god. Someone give this man gold.
49,But does she have an ahoge
50,For Senku it's Ahagao 
51,She just went lmao lol
52,Lick my ass onii-chan?
53,How is this comment both bright and dark at the same time
54,That's humanity for you.
55,2 million years of evolution lead to this comments
56,Commando ftw
57,  My sister: heehee Magma can see Senku's underwear    Indeed.
58,  P A S S I O N
59,  DELETE THIS  
60,Yet another reminder that the mangaka used to do hentai. :p
61,the real reason magma did it
62,There was a bit of symbolism with Magma launching Senku from beneath the water. Only noticed that after they found the rock treasure when Senku mentioned magma beneath water pushing minerals into the white stone.
63,"The look of genuine emotion on Senku's face during the reveal got me.     Also, the best thing to ever come from censorship is rainbow vomit. It was fantastic in Overlord, it was fantastic in Gravity Falls, it's fantastic here. For all the wonderful things the censors keep us from seeing, at least it's given us the wonderful gift of rainbow vomit."
64,"Don't forget Aqua's Rainbow Vomit, too."
65,Of course. Goddesses also don't use the toilet.
66,"Wait, but she is the Goddess of toilets."
67,"No, Toilets are useful."
68,"That's why it is her job to clean them, as a good toilet brush would do."
69,"About the usefulness of a bush, just like aqua."
70,Nor do crimson daemons.
71,also ochako's.  Lotta rainbow vomit huh.
72,rainbow.gif
73,"Dont forget, It got enhanced in season 2."
74,I'm pretty sure that one gnome was barfing an actual rainbow...
75,"Yeah, the same way that a lot of kid's shows have robots as the antagonists so that you can still show the delicious ultraviolence.     You work with the tools you're allowed to have at your disposal. Gravity falls saw the censorship as a ""positive"" and catered it's story to incorporate it. That's one of the many reasons it was as dope as it was."
76,"I thought I remembered that Gintama also had rainbow vomit, but it turns out they only had elevator music."
77,"There has definitely been rainbow vomit in Gintama, and they were doing it before everyone else."
78,Rainbow vomit is the only censorship I'm okay with. It's hilarious.
79,"Censorship creates funny. For instance, as stupid as it is that we're not ""allowed"" to refer to sexual topics genitalia, fucking directly, I doubt any language as quite so many euphemisms for sex as English. We even have euphemisms for our euphemisms."
80,"There was a webcomic I loved called Dr. McNinja that took opportunities to use humor for censorship. For instance, read the text on his fingers"
81,"I'd argue that the vomit in Gravity Falls is canon, being from a magical gnome type thing. ;-"
82,"Goddammit, Chrome just said ""The real treasures were the friends we made along the way."" unironically, the cringe.    So they are save working with Magma, at least until the war is over...    It is so nice seeing once again somebody else taking a scientific initiative. And what a nice birthday present. Nice job Gen!"
83,"Magma wont kill senku even after the war probably. Senku doesn't want the village lead he would be more than happy to give it to Magma, which by that time would have probably learned a thing or two about science himself."
84,I’m really hoping Magma becomes fond of them and gradually goes through more character development.
85,The scene at the end with Gen finding Senku's writing was really cool to see. Gen's first appearance means so much more now that we know he was already in awe with Senku and that he likely came to meet Senku in person for the first time. Really shows how Senku's diligence pays off in small ways that he might not have even foreseen.
86,"I mean it's rare for someone to be so capable of keeping up with Senku and his thought process, Gen is a real gem indeed"
87,Gen is the Gem/ntalist mentalist of the group
88,Pun overload.
89,Bravo
90,"Gen in general has been an amazing character. He went from a side characters who's supposed to fulfill the plot device of being a spy in enemy's land, to genuinely caring and aiding Senku and the Ishigami village. He had no reason to tell others of Senku's birthday, or how to make a telescope but he still did.     He's turning out to be one of my favorite character. Glad to see he isn't a one-dimensional person like Taiju."
91,I'm hoping taiju and yuzuriha are way more ffleshed out when we next see em
92,That crazy son of a bitch placed his bets on Senku from the start. Best girl Gen strikes again.
93,"Wait, Tsukasa’s throne cave is the same place with the bat shit?!"
94,It isn't. Tsukasa probably went to the cave to get more nitric acid
95,Chrome rambling about friendship and the akward silence was just perfect
96,I fully expected them to not take it seriously since it was such a shounen cliche but it still cracked me up when it happened     azusalaugh
97,Ikr.... I was really expecting them to subvert the anime tropes and that awkward silence seal the deal.
98,"Chrome: Friendship is amazing, right guys?    Senku and Magma: lol dude that's   gay   cringy"
99,"Dude is obviously trying to stay best boy, but we all know who Gen is."
100,Gen is the true treasure.
101,Dude got Senku a birthday present when Senku never even directly told him his birthday. That's a real bro right there.
102,This show is so wholesome and dedicated to science. It was really heartwarming to see Gen calculating Senku's 17th birthday. I also loved the part when Magma was trying to force Senku to drop him by saying mean things.
103,"Legit, Magma turned out to be not just a meathead."
104,Still 90% meathead xD
105, It was really heartwarming to see Gen calculating Senku's 17th birthday.    I don't even know how you'd start calculating it
106,Divide the number of days Senku lived by 365. Figure out how many days left until his birthday and denote it with dt. Figure out what day it is today. Subtract that with the day Senku woke up. Add that date with dt and you get Senku's birthday.
107,365.25?
108,Gotta include leap days or you'll look like a fool
109,"And at the end of our long journey, we have realised that the real treasure was, in fact, Gen all along"
110,Who needs a gorilla when you have a boy who can do impressions.
111,TFW no Santa mentalist bro to remember your birthday     sadholo
112,Why even live?
113,HASHIRE SORI YO
114,"And the best thing about Gen, he is a simple man who desires nothing but Cola."
115,Best girl
116,Just like Sasuke.
117,Magma is best tsundere.
118,Sudden good boy. He tried to make them think he attacked Senku so they would let go of his hand and not get dragged into the hole too. ;_;
119,I love how it was never brought up.    It's a cool detail tbh.
120,I like how Senku just instantly seen through it though and didn't even bother to bring it up.
121,Our beloved cola lover
122,"I will never understand how Gen got more votes than Chrome in the first popularity poll which is roughly around here in the story, or maybe a little further."
123,Chrome believes Friendship Is Magic    :3
124,Chrome confirmed to star in the next  Fairy Tail  anime      bacchiri
125,Chrome also confirmed to be pokemon champion material
126,"Chrome isn’t unbeatable though, simple exhaustion got to him. So since he’s not unbeatable, and he definitely doesn’t have a Charizard, who is also unbeaten, he can’t be a Pokemon champion."
127,"I know I'm repeating myself, but  89 years old?  Really? That guy is 89 years old?"
128,Who the fuck is 89?
129,He has a Magma though.
130,  Chrome believes Friendship Is Science    FTFY
131,"  Senku and Magma: lol dude that's   gay      TFW you just barely avoided the ""worst case scenario"""
132,Chrome be like:      Maybe The Real Treasure Was the Friends We Made Along the Way
133,The Real Priceless Gems Was Inside Our Hearts All Along
134,This just made me think of something. What about the people who had pacemakers when they were petrified?  Will they be fine?
135,That’s the least of it.     Consider all the people who were flying in an aircraft at the time of petrification. All their stone fragments are scattered far and wide after every single thing humans have put in the air would have crashed.    Extend this to people driving on highways. A spectacular number of stone fragments just from crashing road traffic.    Trains and Metros crashing into each other and disregarding signals.    Really anyone who was in a moving vehicle is a lost cause.
136,That better not be the one piece!
137,"Senku and Magma ain't taking that   Fairy Tail   shit lol    And once again,   Gen still best boy"
138,"We can knock Chrome all we want, but when Gen and even Magma prove to be such bros this episode, I'm inclined to give him his moment."
139,That shit killed me hahah
140,"Not gonna lie, translating ""気持ち悪い"" as ""cringy"" is a bit cringy in itself."
141,"That was the best possible translation though, ""disgusting"" doesn't really fit the situation."
142,"Even just ""cheesy"" would have been better. ""Cringe"" comes across as too ""hello, fellow kids"". It's modern slang and doesn't really fit.    I mean, it was alright for the meta joke, but it was out of place at the end when it was supposed to be heartfelt."
143,"   ""Cringe"" comes across as too ""hello, fellow kids""    from the anime full of ""level up"" and ""item get"" and dragon quest references the word ""cringe"" is too much now? lol the translation is fine"
144,"The dragon quest references that have been a part of anime for 10 billion years?    Again, I thought it was fine for the comedy scene, but it was really awkward at the end in the heartfelt scene, ""cringe"" just did not fit at all.    ""Meme"" was out of place in the other episode too.    But idk, maybe I'm just not zoomer enough for this shit."
145,Cheesy doesn't mean 気持ち悪いthough. That's just not a translation.
146,"What do you mean? The phrase is so versatile, you can word it a million ways based on the context.     ""That's cheesy"" can mean the exact same thing as ""that's cringey"" in this context. Except doesn't sound as awkward.    What makes you think it's so incorrect to translate it that way?"
147,"Because I'm a native speaker?     ""Cheesy"" is more like 寒い or like くさいセリフ. 寒い means ""cold"", but it's the chill you feel when you hear a really bad dad joke or an ossan tells a bad, bad pun and laughs really smugly and too heartily. くさいセリフ is a line you thought would be really cool but it crashes and burns and is super embarrassing.    気持ち悪い is like nauseating seasick, morning sickness etc, gross, icky, etc.     Cheesy is a bit more lighthearted, while ""cringy"" captures a bit more of the ick factor.    Like, ""bro, that was gross.""    I think ""cringy"" fits. But hey, maybe I'm a HelloFellowKidsTM fogie."
148," Because I'm a native speaker?     And I'm a native english speaker :     but it's the chill you feel when you hear a really bad dad joke or an ossan tells a bad, bad pun and laughs really smugly and too heartily.    Those jokes would be called cheesy. Saying something is cheesy can be equal to calling it cringy in a lot of situations, except ""cringy"" tends to have a bit more vitriol behind it, which is why it felt awkward for the final scene.    Cringy worked fine for the reacting to the bad joke scene anyway.    But no one speaks like that in a heartfelt moment like at the end.     I'm not even all in on ""cheesy"", but I think it would have been better than ""cringy"" in that situation at the very least."
149,You literally repeated what I said then just disagreed for no reason but ok.
150,"If we agree, then why did you disagree with me in the first place? All I did here was further explain the same thing I said above.    I don't understand what you're trying to say by claiming I'm ""just repeating what you said"""
151,"We don't. I explained why ""Cheesy"" doesn't mean 気持ち悪い。that's not even a translation. And then you parroted it for some reason my dude"
152,"Where did I parrot it?    My comment speaks further on the topic, I don't see how I just repeated you.    Maybe your grasp on the english language really isn't that great.     Or are you conveniently ignoring the points I made and just nit picking a small part because you have no real counter argument? :    For example, the part where I said that cheesy is equal to cringy in a lot of situations. So if you think cringy is a valid translation then you must, by extension, think that cheesy is also valid."
153,"No dude, not all synonyms are the same. You can't just look things up in a thesaurus and replace words by transitive property.      There's something called nuance in languages.     Sorry my dude but he didn't say ""Cheesy"". He said ""Ew."" or ""Gross"" or ""nauseating"". That's what 気持ち悪い means.    ""Cringy"" is what's called a localization. It's not a 1-1 translation you won't find this in a dictionary but it makes sense in the context and conveys what the speaker is saying to a good degree because it captures the disgust/ickyness.     That's your mistake.     Plus, cheesy doesn't mean cringy either. If you look up ""Cheesy"" in the dictionary, you're not going to find ""cringy"" there either. Again ""Cheesy"" is lighthearted like a corny hallmark card. There are different words for that in Japanese. And they didn't say them in this episode. Cringy is when you ask your new boss how far along she is, but she's not pregnant, she's just fat. Or this thing you've made into an argument. Or having to explain the difference of these two words to a ""native"" English speaker. Smh.      For example, the part where I said that cheesy is equal to cringy in a lot of situations.       And this isn't one of them.        Maybe your grasp on the english language really isn't that great.     Sad that you have to resort to personal attacks when your English is the one that seems lacking.    I grew up speaking both English and Japanese btw. So nice try."
154," No dude, not all synonyms are the same. You can't just look things up in a thesaurus and replace words by transitive property.      I didn't imply anything of the sort     There's something called nuance in languages.     As was a main part of the point I was making.     Sorry my dude but he didn't say ""Cheesy"". He said ""Ew."" or ""Gross."" That's what 気持ち悪い means.    Ok, but we're not talking about making a 1:1 translation, now are we?     ""Cringy"" is what's called a localization. It's not a 1-1 translation you won't find this in a dictionary     Then why the fuck were you just telling me that it can't be cheesy because it's not a 1:1 translation if now you're going to say that we're not doing a 1:1 translation?    Do you even read the words you are writing? Or do you honestly not see the flagrant contradictions here?     but it makes sense in the context and conveys what the speaker is saying to a good degree because it captures the disgust/ickyness.     In the example of the joke scene, yes, in the final scene, no. Why would there be legitimate disgust in a heartfelt scene? It makes no sense, that is not how people talk in english.     That's your mistake.     Your mistake is not understanding the english language enough to even form a coherent argument, let alone have a valid point on the topic of this language.     Plus, cheesy doesn't mean cringy either. If you look up ""Cheesy"" in the dictionary, you're not going to find ""cringy"" there either. Again ""Cheesy"" is lighthearted like a corny hallmark card.    Previously you were saying ""you can't just look up a synonym"" but now you're saying ""well it doesn't come up as an exact synonym, so it doesn't count.    Cheesy is the same as cringy in most situations, but with less vitriol, which is exactly what would fit the final scene.    ""Cheesy"" is not always 100% lighthearted, it is often used as a negative word, just not  as  negative as cringy.    Similarly, words like ""cliche"" or ""lame"" can be used depending on nuance; there's a myriad of options. I've not been committed entirely to ""cheesy"", but ""cringy"" was clunky and awkward as fuck in that final scene.     Sad that you have to resort to personal attacks when your English is the one that seems lacking.    It's relevant when this discussion is about the language and you tried to pull the ""well I'm a native speaker"" card on me already."
156,"Could you please point out which arguments you disagree with and for what reason?    Or are you just going to be uselessly arrogant without ever testing your mettle in debate?    If two words can mean similar things in context, then they can be interchanged depending on nuance. This is not even necessarily a discussion on translation, it is simply switching an english word to a more appropriate synonym."
157,"I agree, it worked the first time for it's comedic purpose, but not the second time where it was used in the closing line which as you said was supposed to be heartfelt.    But this is the problem I guess when translating a characters mannerisms and making it work for two purposes.  I'd still go with 'cheesy', I'd rather lessen the comedy than the drama."
158,"The phrase is pretty versatile, so it would be perfectly fine to translate it different depending on the situation. But CR seems to be anal about trying to have perfectly consistent translations, even if it ends up being a detriment to the dialogue, or involves repeating a mistake.    The use of modern slang is also going to make the translation age much worse."
159,"The 1990's were 30 years ago, they aren't modern anymore."
160,"1990s? What do you mean?    ""Cringey"" has only come into popularity in like the second half of this decade.    ""Cringe"" was a word beforehand, but not used in this way."
161,"People have definitely been saying ""cringey"" for way longer than half a decade. I've personally used it as far back as 2004/5."
162,"At the very least, it was not popular. I never heard it used that way in the 00s"
164,"Speaking of translations in term of ""factually correct"" shows how little  you know. Good translations are not whatever comes first on the dictionary, they are about meaning, context and connotation. The most literal translation often fails to convey the corresponding manners of speech across different languages and cultures."
165,"Modern slang is already in the show. Chrome already uses a slang form of “yabai” which literally means dangerous but is used by most young people as a slang “yabe” as an expletive like “fuck”. It can be used as a word for amazing or surprising or super or whatever.       Both “yabe” and “kimochi warui” are used often when people are joking around with their friends, in this case, the latter is used to show disgust jokingly. Cringy is a pretty apt translation since it portrays the exact thing that the speakers are trying to portray.           Also, I’d argue that “cheesy” is a wrong translation for that word. It doesn’t mean cheesy, wtf?           Source: I’m Japanese."
166,"Don't bother. I already tried telling him that's not what it means, but he really really wants it to be.     Also Japanese."
167,"It’s kinda obvious that the people harping about these translations are people who don’t speak a lick of the language. The word is familiar to them and they’ve seen how its usually translated and go from there. The translation fits perfectly with the meaning in that context, most translations aren’t literal and they shouldn’t be because the words aren’t being used literally in the source material. Show is full of modern slang and I don’t know why they think the translations shouldn’t be the same."
168,"Right?    I would've taken ""Ew."" or ""Gross"" but because there's so much slang in the source material, ""cringy"" felt perfect.     I usually take issue with CR subs but I thought it was actually well done here."
169,What’s it work better as? I can’t read a word of Japanese
170,"""Gross"".    Idk, I'm a kind of a fan of localizations like this tho. It got the point across. Maybe I'm a fogie though.     The one about the ""meme"" a few eps back was a bit of a stretch though."
171,"""Creepy"" is what I always hear it as. I dunno, maybe I've just heard the word ""cringe"" too often and I'm affected by personal bias."
172,"It basically just means ""bad feeling"" and is kinda versatile.    So ""cringy"" isn't wrong perse, just feels weird to have modern slang like that thrown into the script. Even just ""cheesy"" would have been better imo.    ""Cringy"" worked alright for the friendship part, but felt really out of place at the end."
173,"Dude you have a problem with the source material then.    There's so much modern slang in Japanese in the show.    As for the translation, I've already tried to teach you what these words mean in Japanese in another thread here.     It fits. That's what they said.    Also no, it doesn't mean ""bad feeling"" for the last time."
174," I've already tried to teach you what these words mean in Japanese in another thread here.     You may not have realised, but the translation is not in japanese.    I have tried to teach you what these words mean in english, and that it doesn't fit as well as alternatives.    If you want to be condescending with me because you're a native japanese speaker, then forgive me if I don't take your opinion on what sounds natural in english too seriously :"
175,"Dude. Again. I'm also a native English speaker. I grew up speaking both. How is that so difficult to understand.     Idk what more I can say. 気持ち悪い doesn't mean cheesy. Sorry!    Talk about ""cringy"", feeling all superior because you're a ""native English speaker"" on fucking reddit, criticizing a translation of a language you done even speak. Yikes."
176," Dude. Again. I'm also a native English speaker. I grew up speaking both. How is that so difficult to understand.     You never said that     Idk what more I can say. 気持ち悪い doesn't mean cheesy. Sorry!    What you could say is making any attempt to counter the arguments I have set forth instead of just repeating yourself with no justification.    Idk what more I can say. ""Cheesy"" can mean the same as ""cringy"". Sorry!     Talk about ""cringy"", feeling all superior because you're a ""native English speaker"" on fucking reddit, criticizing a translation of a language you done even speak. Yikes.    I was only mimicking you for being condescending about being a native japanese speaker, when this is not a conversation purely about japanese :    You continue to miss the subtext of the conversation."
178,"Yes, it is modern slang.    The word has been around, but it was not used in the way it is today, which is the way it was used in the anime.    ""Cringe"" was a verb to describe a type of tensing of the body. You might cringe at the sight of blood.    People didn't call something ""cringey"" or describe social awkwardness or cheesy lines as ""cringe"" until this decade."
180,"In the comedy scene it was fine, in the dramatic scene it really did not do that, the dialogue felt quite awkward."
181,"Well, they use the word meme too so it doesn't feel that out of place. Remember that it's still the future guys."
182,"Meme felt out of place too, there was a whole discussion on how that was not only out of place, but an incorrect translation.    At least this one can pass as correct even if awkward.    ""It's the future"" means nothing. They don't live in our society with our modern slang, there's no reason for them to use trendy language.    It just feels like ""how do you do, fellow kids"""
183,hm how about eerie?
184,"Close. They sound similar, but different meanings. Eerie is 気味悪い kimi warui but it's 気持ち悪い here. kimochi warui."
185,always shown again why Japanese is so hard to learn
186,"the 3rd time it was used, i suddenly recognized it and knew what was being said    and the reason i remember it, is because that is also the very final line from the `end of evangelion` movie, and i had seen a video before on how it could be translated"
187,"No, in this situation it is a very accurate translation.  Kimochi warui is applicable to a lot of different things which have various separate meanings in English.  Cringy is just one of them."
188,"Senku’s worst case scenario: they had to hug each other for warmth while the water rise.    Actual worst case scenario: Senku die before his birthday and missed seeing what would be his greatest birthday gift by far in the stone world!    Happy Birthday Senku!    Edit: fix some wording,grammar and stuff"
189,How can this show be so heartwarming?     TOMODA
190,  Senku die before his birthday and missed seeing what would be his greatest birthday gift by far            I don't know that time his dad sold the car and gave him an entire lab is still up there.
191,Surely the village itself is the best present his dad ever gave Senku?
192,Senku's dad with the big brain move
193,Good point but was that a birthday gift?
194,Tbf i think that was christmas
195,That was Christmas. XD
196,Yeah! you are right.
197,"Senku is precise as atomic clock. And as calculator.    Nice episode of Senku, Chrome and Magma playing Terraria."
198,"  playing Terraria.    Thank God they weren't actually playing Terraria, otherwise they'd be dead from a fucking Boulder Trap or an Explosive Trap.    FML, those things tilt me."
199,"Funnily enough, going through all this work to make a cell phone is very much Terraria. God, those things take forever to make."
200,"It’s not as complicated as that, but that’s how I want to be able to calculate things. I’m able to since I can visualize me writing it out, but because my high school math teachers were shit I can barely mentally calculate stuff"
201,I can barely do grocery store math lucky you
202,"Can't believe we only have 2 episodes left, I'm really gonna miss this series. Hope we get season 2 super soon!"
203,"There's a Dr. Stone panel at Jump Festa in like a week, I wouldn't doubt it."
204,My Fridays will be meaningless until it returns.
205,join the manga cult
206,I want to do that so bad but I’m watching with my wife and if I go ahead she would be maaaad!
207,"This is where I'm at. This show has totally captured my heart. Dr. Stone has quickly risen to the point of being one of my favorite anime of all time, so it's going to really, really suck when the season ends."
208,Theres definitely enough content for a second season although maybe single cour so it doesn't catch up too quickly
209,"I think there's barely enough manga for another two-cour season.    I plan on jumping into the manga as soon as the anime is over. My wife's already started, and is almost caught up. I should really do the same...    ...and now there's a second manga,  Dr. Stone reboot , and it's about his father. There are six chapters up of that so far."
210,Unless there's huge manga seles boost or merch there's no chance for 2nd season because BDs sell like shit.
211,"Bruh I almost fucking cried when they showed him the telescope    Also, I am happy that they made Magma an actual good guy in this episode. I always liked the powerful guys in anime, and giving Magma an actual good guy personality other than ""I sHoULd HaVe BeEn ThE vIlLaGe ChIef"" is so refreshing.    10/10"
212,Senku shared his cotton candy to the village. The village gave back a telescope
213,"Senku also gave them ramen, light, glasses, medicine, batteries, Katanas, and pretty soon cellphones. It's crazy how much he's done for this village."
214,Dem village girls thirsty for that new genes
215,"""Hey y'all, in the name of science I need to fuck all your girls. I hope you understand""    ""I still don't know what science is but it hasn't failed us before, go ahead Senku!"""
216,the doujins are already writing themselves
217,No one can resist the cauliflower haired scienceman     umucool
218,I really love how they did the stars in that scene.
219,Can't wait for Black Science Man to tweet that the stars were off.
220,"Does Black Science Man know about this anime? I did tweet to him about it once, dunno if he ever saw it."
221,only to have egg on his face when people point out that the stars have shifted over the years
222,"Excuse me, it's leak haired. Get it right."
223,He should get a plumber to take a look at his hair then.
224,"I'm retarded, fixed"
225,"No, keep your shame."
226,"Fine, I'll edit it back"
227,"If it wasn't because i am shipping Gen with pretty much every girl he talks to.    I would say that that line sounds almost like a love confession, almost..."
228,"Well, I am pretty sure it is going to be something like radio receivers and transmitters which can only work with Morse code but yeah."
229,I think he'll make a microphone and speakers for it too.
230,"There is Rochelle's salt on the diagram and as far as I know, it changes acoustic vibrations into electrical waves or something like that and is normally used in microphones, so that's highly likely"
231,I’m expecting nothing less than an iPhone 4
232,IStone 4 you mean
233,Also the vacuum tube they are making is most likely going to be used as an amplifier.
234,"Yeah, i think he's producing something akin to a crystal radio set..."
235,"In Chrome's words, ""YA BE""."
236,Technically Senku's the entire reason the village exists.  If his dad hadn't known Senku and gone through using Senku's technique to figure out where the petrification started then they probably would have landed somewhere other than Japan.    Which would mean that they wouldn't have been there when Senku was unpetrified and so the village wouldn't be there at all.  So technically they owe their entire villages existence to Senku.
237,I'm waiting for a certain quote from one of the village elders ...
238,Minecraft villagers
239,"Also, have you seen that look he gave after Chrome accused him of trying to push Senku? He looks so hurt. Like realizing that ""Oh yeah they see me as a bad guy anyway, guess I won't be able to prove them wrong that it wasn't like that"" and goes along with his usual attitude, saying something they are expecting to hear, instead of defending himself, but at the same time expressing his bitterness and how his pride was hurt when he lost to Senku. For a guy that was probably only acknowledged thanks to his strength, being defeated by somebody weaker must have been a real blow. Makes you understand and see him in a completely different light."
240,When I first saw the scene I thought he was acting like a bad guy to get Senku to let go so he wouldn't fall with him.
241,"He was, but also somewhat venting."
242,"AKA, he acted like a human being.    Quite a well written scene if you ask me."
243,This. Honestly Magma's character development is really good. I enjoy him now.
244,Magma was still trying to prove his intentions of killing and wants to check the trust shows he is somewhat soft from inside beside being powerful.
245,Almost? Made of stronger stuff than me.
246,Magma reminds me of Demikas from Log Horizon.
247,"I came to this thread looking for answers but nobody is discussing this. So Magma went into the cave with the full intent of killing Senku and Chrome. They almost died earlier than he wanted to kill them by falling in the pit, so he rescues Senku. If Senku actually fell in it'd be a genuine accident and he'd get what he set out to achieve. Afterwards he just decides not to kill them after all, and now he's a good guy? Not sure how that follows, or why he saved Senku so that he could kill him differently later. What am I misunderstanding?"
248,"He planned to kill them, but his heart betrayed him when Senku was in actual mortal danger. So he realized what he actually wanted."
249,Ah okay. That kinda makes sense. Maybe I'm dumb but I dunno if that was explained well.
250,"  I sHoULd HaVe BeEn ThE vIlLaGe ChIe    To be fair, he didn't take his last loss that well either, but while a sore loser, he never really took revenge on Kohaku either.      At most he and his sleazy help tried to keep her away from the next opportunity he got      But he's still an idiot/meathead and cruel. tho I guess you can also argue he was just taunting his opponents when he started talking for his plans when he became the head of the village. Which would be fair game tbh"
251,"Every other season I have a ""cry no matter what"" anime and this has been it. So much joy, wonder, love, SCIENCE. Every episode. So good."
252,Imagine feeling weird that you'd have to huddle against a hunk like Senku for warmth.    Magma missed out
253,Magma lowkey wants to be the small spoon
254,Don't we all 
255, Broscience      fujostare
256,this show has the best reaction faces
257,These doujins write themselves.
258,Gen is not a villain. Not even a little. I love this so much.
259,I love the super evil faces they are constantly giving Gen and Senku.
260,"""Are we the villains?"""
261,"He's very practical, and he'll gladly switch sides in a heartbeat if he thinks the other team has a better chance of winning, but neither of these traits are particularly evil. He's more of a chaotic neutral, he'll do whatever he feels is most beneficial to the greatest number of people, regardless of the implications."
262,"I don't know if he'd switch sides at this point, to be honest. He seems to really be fond of Senku he even says so. I mean, if Senku loses and dies, then that's the end of that. But as long as Senku is alive, I don't see Gen getting off Senku's Wild Ride."
263,"Right? I’m surprised people still think Gen is a neutral. I thought they made it clear he made up his mind about which side he was on when Senku  made that lightbulb. He just needed to give himself an excuse to join the side he wanted to be on anyway, and that was the cola."
264,He's such a good mentalist that he even fool the audience
265,"Senku can make cola, it's a bond forged by sugary treats a.k.a the strongest in the universe"
266,"Not to mention that Tsukasa would most likely put him on death row for the crime of betraying his kingdom as well, lol."
267,"Atcually, he is cola-aligned."
268,Maybe the real treasure was the friends we made along the way.
269,Chrome aiming to be the next Hokage.
270,Chrome probably found one piece during his fucking about
271,"Ya-yo, ya-yo!"
272,I just realized that Brock is narrating. lol
273,"oh god, so that was what he has been up to ever since his journey with ash."
274,Dr. Feels strikes again     comfortfood
275,"Aww, Gen and Magma turned out to be such softies. Now I feel bad for having doubts on bringing Magma."
276,Gen besto girl. Such a fangirl of Senku
277,"I love how senku and even magma called out how cringy the power of friendship is, nice to see that hasnt changed in the stone world. And magmas redemption felt earned. I figured once he gor his sword he was going to be on senkus side, and its nice to see him make the transition to ally.   The fact that gen tricked senku into telling him his birthday is brilliant. And giving him a telescope, something he misses about the old world, was perfect. Even if hes gonna use it to mostly watch tsukasa, it really was a great gift. Especially for if they survive the war."
278,"Tungsten, also a great material for making weapons to fight Diclonius. But to do that, We Require More Minerals.      Mecha-Senku exposition powers Go!      Senku is right, that worst case scenario would've been bad...      That shpeal about finding the precious treasure of friendship.... Yeah, save the sap for when Senku brings back pancakes there guy.      As soon as it showed what Gen whispered to Magma it all clicked that it was gonna be his birthday. And what a present they gave him. I mean just look at Senku's face, during that presentation looks like his heart just cracked in half with emotions. Even if he plays it off with his practicality."
279," Save, the sap for when Senku brings back pancakes    We're gonna need a tiny blue haired girl and some books for that."
280,Man i can't wait for season 2
281,"What's he referring to? Sorry, I'm uncultured."
282,Ascendance of a Bookworm
283,Honestly I'm surprised she beat Senku to the punch on that one.
284,Cooking is an art... but baking is chemistry at it's finest.
285,I'd much rather a paramilitary self-multiplying wolf-girl.    PANCAKES!!!
286,"Wow if you told me a year ago that i would be entertained as hell by a science show, i'd ask you where you buy your booze.    Only Anime can somehow make the concept of building a cell phone interesting."
287,Literally last season there was an anime that genuinely motivates you to work out for those that may not do so before showing cute girls that want to either loose weight or get macho.    Anime can truly make almost anything appealing.
288,"Yeah, that show really motived me to finally use that dumbbell set that I had bought three years ago."
289,"That's how I started. After a few years of using them I finally got myself into a gym and started working out properly and I wish I went sooner. Keep going with them, eventually you'll outgrow them and want to head to a gym too :"
290,"It was a 200 lb set, so it would take me a while to outgrow them."
291,"Haha, that's awesome. As long as you don't give up you'll get there."
292,"That's approximately 90 kg, for the people who use science units."
293,Name of show?
294,Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?
295,"Doesn't work for a lot of people, including myself. I have neither the time nor the drive to do anything that involves physical activity."
296,"It’s solely because of rewatching anime on the treadmill that I can run 9 miles nonstop now, but I’ve been slacking on the weight lifting. I’m thinking maybe I’ll give this show a try + Jojo where everyone’s swole as hell    I just need to find some anime to rewatch while I lift weights now is all."
297,P5 and beyond Jojo characters are basically twinks.
298,Have you seen Gappy without a shirt? That man is  ripped .
299,And let's not forget last year with a show that motivated us to learn a bit of biology
300,Loved Cells at Work. I have screenshots from that show in my hematology flashcards for school.
301,"If you need another example of anime's power, Haikyuu heavily increased the amount of japanese students signing up for volleyball"
302,What was it's name? I missed it.
303,Dumbell nan kilo moteru? or How heavy are the dumbells you lift?
304,What's the name of this anime bro
305,Dumbell nan kilo moteru?    Or; How heavy are the dumbells you lift?
306,what is that anime called
307,"I think what makes it good is the investment of the characters. You know the stakes from the very beginning and it doesn't try to offload as much as information as it can unlike other educational I'm not talking about Cells at Work shows. You get what these characters need to do to succeed at what they want and it's exciting. That's what makes it entertaining anyways. Also, it never loses its heart throughout the show."
308,So true.    But then I remember how much I loved Steins;Gate.    Maybe I actually have a thing for science shows! Feel like we need more of them!
309,There’s not much real science at all in Steins;Gate though.
310,NANI?!?!
311,"Honestly I think it’s the other way around, only school can make it boring.    Like, you’re talking about learning how to summon and dominate invisible forces to command them to carry your voice to a distant listener. Sure, there’s a lot of arcane symbols involved, but all wizards need spell formulas."
312,"I love this ""instructional video"" trend in anime. It's so fun to watch. First one I noticed this in was probably Laid Back Camp Yurucampu."
313,"Honestly, I feel like anime can turn a lot of topics into something interesting. Prior to watching Haikyuu, I never would have thought that I'd be interested in a volleyball anime cause I didn't particularly enjoy volleyball and yet Haikyuu turned out to be one of my favorite anime."
314,"Thanks to this episode we know the date thanks to Senku's counting.  January 4th 5740, knowing this we could actually calculate the sky-scape they should be able to see.  Using Really cool site if you wanna get into astronomy     Note that the site requests to not put dates more than 2200,  but it still calculates so I'm not sure how accurate it is.    It shows that Saturn shouldn't be visable as the Sun would be in the way.  But Senku sees a blurry planet with rings.    This means that one of these must be true    1The show didn't pay that much attention to detail    2the online model isn't that accurate    3Senku's counting was off    4Jupiter gained prominent rings from Moons colliding which would be the coolest"
315,"It's probably a combination of 1 and 2, due to changes in Earth's rotation things should be a little off.    Saturn is probably the easiest planet to identify when blurry, so I can understand using it here.    Also, Jupiter has rings! They were discovered in 1979 by Voyager 1, but given the technology Senku currently has they wouldn't be visible."
316,"Yeah, Jupiter's rings aren't nearly as expansive as Saturn's. But it's also been 3700 years. A lot of weird astronomical events could've have happened!"
317,Saturn's rings are believed to be 100 million years old.   3700 years is long for a human but an impossibly brief period at those scales.
318,"Even if the moons collided due to some strange astronomical collision, I'd guess that it would take much longer than 3700 years for the fragments leftover to coalesce into rings like that."
319,you can use stellarium to simulate further in time than 2200.
320,"According to Stellarium, Saturn would be visible that night and Polaris would still be pretty accurate "
321,Polaris looks more than 20 degrees off of true north in that.  No one would call that an accurate North Star.   It's only 0.7 degrees off today.
322,It’s off in the show too. That was a minor plot point in one episode.
323,Oh maybe that's what he meant by the stars accuracy...
324,Thanks for checking this! Glad to see the show was right even if they didn't check it themselves.
325,  This means that one of these must be true    5 Show takes place in an alternate version of Earth where the other planets are slightly their orbit than in our own universe which explains why their Saturn is visible but ours is not.
326,"Yeah, this is a show where humanity turned to stone and a teenager punched a lion to death."
327,To think that the only thing preventing teenagers from punching lions to death is the orbit of Saturn. Truly we live in the worst timeline.
328,"Pretty much. Compared to that stuff, Saturn's orbit being a few years more/less along than it is in real life is pretty mundane."
329,How much force is needed to punch a lion to death?
330,It's not necessarily the force that's hard to get. Modern day Boxers can definitely get into the hundreds of pounds of force. It's the speed needed to attack a Lion in the first place and not have them bite your arm off.
331,"This is a great question and perhaps one that goes above and beyond the scope of /r/anime and into /r/space or /r/askscience. A simple ""Would Saturn be visible from the Japanese sky on January 4th 5740?"" I bet they'd love to get you an accurate answer, and I bet a fair number of them watch  Dr. Stone ."
332,"Gen said January 4th, and the tree said April 1st, Why was that?"
333,April 1st 5738 is when Senku woke up from the stone. Since then it has been a year and a half. Gen was able to deduce that Senku's birthday would be January 4th when Senku told Gen how many days old he was..
334,"Senku said he was 6268 days old. Gen somehow deduced that his birthday was in 3 days.    How does this make sense? Wouldn't Senku's age in days be a multiple of 365 or slightly less? 6268 + 3 days is 17.18 years. Senku's ""birthday"" should have been over 2 months prior."
335,"It's the anniversary of the date of his birth, not the turnover to a new multiple of 365 days of being alive    You know what day everyone was turned to stone, the day Senku woke up, and how many days Senku has been awake, and the current date, you can deduce his birth date.    First calculate the number of days  since he  unpetrified.    Subtract that from the  number of days senku has been alive.  That  gives you his age, in days,  at the time of the petrification event.    Now  you  know  senku's age to the day when he was petrified.  You  know the  date  of the petrification.  You  know  there's no gaps between the day of his birth and the day of petrification in terms of his age progression.   You can calculate the date of his birth"
336,January 4th = Birthday/Present    April 1sr = Day Senku got unpetrified
337,"6 The petrification event, or some other event in the interim, is a factor."
338,It is obviously number 1. This is not how you use a telescope.
339,"That's just the Finderscope. Larger field of view at loss of magnification. Useful for finding the bodies you want to see, though it probably wouldn't be able to see the ISS."
340,"Alright, you talented fujoshi and lemon writers! Do your thing!     I want Senku x Magma on my desk by five! No, wait, Magma x Senku!  WHY ISN'T THIS STACK OF SENKU X GEN DOUJINSHI TALLER, DAMN IT?!     GET ME PICTURES OF SPIDER-MAN!   "
341,Oh shit Senku x Magma x  Spiderman ?!
342,Somebody call Deadpool.
343,"MagSen is absolutely gonna be a ship now, after that what-if shot. There's no way. There's some good SenChrome out there, but I think it should be the other way around. No way Senku tops."
344,He'd 100% be a power bottom
345,"   Stitches!      Creepy Gen      Senku Saving Magma      Senku & Magma      Magma Saving Senku      Chrome's Power of Friendship      More Creepy Gen      Stargazing Senku      Stargazing Gen    Chrome pulling a ""Maybe The Real Treasure Was the Friends We Made Along the Way""      Glad to see my fears about Magma was incorrect. He was just being a huge tsundere acting like he doesn't care. I genuinely thought Gen threatened Magma with something but apparently he just told him about Senku's birthday, which is actually really nice and would've meant he also wanted to repay Senku if he was in on the surprise.     That final scene with everyone's gift to Senku made me a bit teary eyed ngl. This show is so wholesome when it comes to moments like this that I am legit sad that we only have 2 episodes left T_T"
346,Can you complete the Senku and Magma stcih with the towers. Thanks. Im in the construction field this statement is soo true
347,Done.
348,Looking like the cover of an actual construction anime.
349,spinoff when
350,Senku and Magma build a manufactorum
351,Boichi bless
352," Senku Saving Magma    I really like the running gag of Senku's lacking physical ability. It's hilarious when he looks all badass and confident in one scene, then completely out of breath and exhausted in another. I think the contrast helps emphasize how important his intelligence is to him."
353,Gen has the best faces. Senku close second.
354,"Great episode, giving Magma some personality was long overdue    What put me off a bit is how Kohaku's winter clothes left her legs open. I understand fan service, but this clothing doesn't serve any purpose if half of your body is uncovered, I'm getting cold just by looking at her"
355,Reminds me of this
356,"Bruh, she is literally a cavewoman that could chop off your head in one kick, her legs are supernatural for our standards."
357,I want gorilla to crush my head with her thighs
358,"Man, who wouldn't?"
359,Pure. Unadulterated. Raw. Primal. SEXUAL ENERGY.
360,"Meh, I see this all the time, not only in anime, but IRL, as well. Girls with legs bare in winter is a thing."
361,"Gosh darn it, that change of perspective and suddenly cut music is one of the best comedic measures I've ever seen. Poor Chrome XD    Also that small moment when Senku thought that the villagers betrayed him breaks my heart. It wasn't shown, but he must have been considering the possibility of that happening this whole time but still decided to trust them. In that one shot, he looks so heartbroken, disenchanted and probably thinking how naive he was. How much of a relief it was for him to be proved wrong, absolutely moving."
362,Yes yes yes that moment broke my heart completely. I knew they were going to give him a surprise or something but his looks were just so...  sad. This anime just keeps getting better every week
363,The moaning LMFAO
364,Senkus chilly voice aswell
365,I can't believe they've done this lol
366,I expected one moan when the topic was brought up but it just kept repeating as Senku talked lmao
367,I really like how stressed Senku was over the possibility that Gen convinced everyone to convert to Tsukasa.  Very solid moment of weakness and insecurity.
368,"Dr. Stone out here inspiring weebs to study science.    For real though, this episode was really interesting and wholesome.    Edit: bonus meme"
369,We shall never underestimate the cultural impact of anime
370,Link for the lazy
371,Also there's this other one
372,"""THE TREASURE"" was such a fitting title for this awesome episode"
373,I am definitely going to try the trick shown in my bathtub
374,"I remember learning about this in high school. The weird part is, it doesn't work unless you first fill up the tube with water, and only then set it up. It has to do with the property of water sticking to itself, I believe. As a result, the water being pulled down by gravity drags the water behind it up the tube, and because the exit side is lower than the entrance side, the water has stronger pull to the exit than it does pull to the entrance. Feel free to correct me if I have this explanation wrong."
375,You can also just dip the tube in the water and suck on the other end like a straw to kickstart it. That's how I used to start racking my beer when homebrewing before I got a siphon.
376,Thats lewd
377,I'm bad at explaining things so I'll just leave this link here.
378,"So I guess I'm partially correct, it's that plus the atmospheric pressure bit. Interesting how to this day we still don't exactly understand how it works. It's some serious black magic, that's for sure."
379,"Its more or less just gravity. When the water starts going downwards instead of up, there's a vacuum which is filled by more water."
380,"According to the article though, siphons work in vacuums too. So it’s not that."
381,"I use siphoning to refill my tank of freshwater shrimp. They are sensitive to quick water changes, so I prepare a bucket of water, elevate it above them, and then use a siphon and a knot to drip water in over several hours. Its a pretty cool trick."
382,Tried it using washing machine before. It was fun. But got scolded by mum afterwards.
383,Did lab work at uni and had to frequently empty out the dirty water from one of the equipment using this method. Pretty fun!
384,"This even works with a towel.  Put one end in the tub, the other hanging over the side. Congratulations; you just flooded the bathroom."
385,"This show is so wonderfully uplifting.     I'm genuinely going to miss it and it's been a while since I said that about a show. Shows I've enjoyed, even shows I've loved is a long list but shows I'm going to miss? Very few of those."
386,You said it. It's so upbeat and simple fun. It's the one show I'm genuinely excited to start a new episode of every week.
387,"How can someone so sleazy be so awesome at the same time?    Seriously, Gen is becoming my favorite character."
388,Gen is the epitome of chaotic good.
389,"I think the reason this episode worked so well is because there were two ways to express feelings    One is to just say it, and it's cringy and it's awkward, but is still true    The other is the implicit way, Gen and the village didn't say anything explicitly, they simply showed how much they care, and that gets you    In fact after explaining how he had figured out Senku's birthday Gen finally says some of his feelings explicitly, how he has always admired Senku, and even though they say that is cringy, it really wasn't. Someone the implicit acts from before opened Senku, and us the audience, to be more receptive, it's like he walked right into our hearts"
390,"im being dumb, why did Gen have to know Senku's revival day? Can't he just figure out his birthday solely by the number of days Senku was alive?"
391,They weren't counting the time spent in stone. He had to use the revival date as a reference point
392,"Another great episode, Dr. Stone is definitely anime of this season and the last and probably all others it might air in.    Also, pretty hyped for when Senku can finally flex his science muscle properly without any major threats / problems he has to address first or severely lacking resources.    Also hoping when the story ends it's with Senku going on a deep space mission to another Star or after that, colonizing another planet already."
393,"It's good, but doesn't beat average or bookworm for me this season."
394,It’s a good show but Vinland Saga still takes it for me.
395,Man just like how when Made in Abyss aired I said I wanted a game based on it I'd love a Dr Stone game.    Chrome: Maybe the real treasure were the friends we made along the way.    Senku & Magma: Nah man that's cringe.    Aww they made him a telescope for his birthday. Precious.
396,  I'd love a Dr Stone game.    Minecraft:  I'm a joke to you? 
397,I love the hell out of Minecraft but it needs way more ores. Despite being the best selling game of all time it isn't perfect.
398,Play Modded.
399,Mods can be great but I often find that I'm not interested in most mods I find. I'm playing on Bedrock version as well so most mods are not available to me.
400,A Dr. Stone mod would be awesome
401,How about factorio angel+bob’s mod added?
402,I've heard good things about Factorio. Maybe I'll give that a try sometime.
403,"Factorio is one of the best games ever made, IMO.    Also play Satisfactory, which is Factorio in first person."
404,I went to their site and saw they offer a demo. Will probably try that soon!
405,"Just have a weekend where you're not planning to do much.     Also, it is in ""early access"" but Factorio is more polished than most games ever released. It is very stable and runs phenomenally well. Most of the content is complete as well. Have fun!"
406,Thanks. I've actually got a lot of games I've been meaning to play lately. Recently got an Xbox One after mostly only having Nintendo handhelds for years so my selection of games has expanded quite a bit.
407,"The closest thing to a Made in Abyss game that I've heard of is Etrian Odyssey. Played it for a bit, was cool, but something AAA like Breath of the Wild would be a dream come true."
408,"believe me or not, I'm not purposely being a jerk. but the game is called scienc or real life    it takes a while to get there in science field though. but totally worth it even thogh you may not find a job in your field."
409,Nah it'd have to be a game for me. I love games like Terraria or Minecraft where you find resources to be able to move on to harder challenges and stronger enemies. A combination of a Made in Abyss game and a Dr Stone game would be mind blowing.
410,Gen is always so sus and sly lookin     but low-key the sweetest dude ever
411,I swear this show makes me tear up every damm episode.    Gen is so best boi
412,Best girl
413,"Senku's realist outlook when he was tied up is actually quite sad, predicting and accepting that they all might turn on him to save their village which makes perfect sense given the circumstances. The ending was a pleasant relief and totally awesome cringefest."
414,"Senku and I share the same birthday, that’s 10 billion percent awesome     I also got some respect for Magma now, dude wants to see cool shit now more than he wants to be the boss    And even   more   respect for Gen, making Senku both a fucking telescope and being such a fanboy of Senku’s insanity since the very beginning of his un-petrification"
415,January 4th gang
416,One second I was yelling at Senku for being a dumbass and doubting his friends and the next second I was legit sobbing tears into my noodles.    Thanks for making me cry again Dr Stone and helping me realise that I do love science after all...
417,Never in all my years of anime would I have thought  a fucking telescope  would have me feeling some type of way.
418,well if you're brave enough
419,"As an astronomer with a 12"" telescope... There's really nothing quite like seeing the rings of Saturn for the first time with your own eye... Just blows your mind..."
420,Senku and Magma: Nakama powers are eeew.
421,WTF Senku. Why are you looking in the finder and not the eyepiece?
422,I thought I was the only one that noticed it heh.
423,"Ngl I teared up at the end, being an astronomer was always my dream. My sister got me a Meade telescope for Christmas one year and it's the best gift I've ever got, having friends like that would be amazing. Great episode."
424,"Yeah, Magma is now officially a good guy, but his intention at start was to kill Ruri so I can't really get myself to like him..."
425,"I don't think he was actually going to kill Ruri. She was basically guaranteed to die within the week regardless of his actions, I think he played it off the way he did just because he wanted to sound all macho and uncaring. Similar to in this episode, where he pretended he was planning to kill Senku so that they'd let him go."
426,"But I mean...he definitely intended to kill Gen though, right? I mean he almost did."
427,"Gen was a witch, doesn't count."
428,"Gen was an invader from outside the village, and a sorcerer to boot."
429,"I guess it's just his public face to appear as a strong heartless man. But deep down, he is really wholesome dude that would likely help Ruri as much as he can"
430,"if you think about it, before Senku came along and dropped antibiotics on the village, being sick like Ruri was a death sentence. Period. No ifs ands or buts. You can fall in love with someone who you think is going to die soon, but it's a lot easier to distance yourself and act as if the person is dead already.    When Magma talks about 'killing' Ruri, he's thinking that she's simply going to die before any real 'marriage' can happen. If she tried to have kids, she wouldn't last the term."
431,"Wholesome? He went into the cave to kill Senku and then only saved him so he could kill him the way he wanted to. Then he just decides not to later because Senku was giving him cool toys. I get he's supposed to be wholesome but I don't see how it follows from his actions, am I missing something?"
432,"He never wanted to kill senku, he just acted like it because he’s a tsundere"
433,"He's said many times he wanted to kill him and one time he acted like he didn't and everyone calls him a good guy. Obviously that's the direction the story is going, but just seems like it could have been more convincing."
434,You do know that getting sick is death sentence on the village?
435,"I came to this thread looking for answers but nobody is discussing this. So Magma went into the cave with the full intent of killing Senku and Chrome. They almost died earlier than he wanted to kill them by falling in the pit, so he rescues Senku. If Senku actually fell in it'd be a genuine accident and he'd get what he set out to achieve. Afterwards he just decides not to kill them after all, and now he's a good guy? Not sure how that follows, or why he saved Senku so that he could kill him differently later. What am I misunderstanding?"
436,"I dont think he was gonna kill them from the start at all, he had several opportunities to do so and he didnt. He just said what he said when he was about to fall into the pit because he thought there was no way to prove himself after all he did so he might as well let himself fall so Senku can live. Anything similar he said later on was just his pride talking.    Or if you're very cynical, he wants to defeat Senku fair and square in front of the village so he can legitimately become chief rather than deal with the suspicion and controversy that being the only one to come out of the cave would bring."
437,Was not expecting Magma’s ‘betrayal’ to lead up to that.
438,Don’t mind me. Just gonna sit over here and cry at how pure this episode was.     The fact that the whole village came together to surprise Senku for his birthday just makes me so happy. They’ve come so far since he showed up as just an outsider.
439,I felt like Senku was about to cry when he was blind folded holy shit
440,I felt pure sadness from that scene
441,"Just another ep that consolidates Gen as best boy, such a heartwarming episode, loved it!!"
442,Why is Asagiri Gen best girl of the show?
443,  What the fuck chrome. You don't say things like that here     gabdisgust     When actually on the inside     I'm touched akkotears
444,"I really hope we get a season 2 in the future, easily one of my favourite anime this year.  What I love about this show is that there are some genuine emotional moments in this show.     Gen is best boy though not including senku. The fact he got the whole village together to make senku a birthday gift is touching.  I’m so glad gen is a good guy since I love him so much."
445,Does tgis season end at 24 episodes? Or do we not know yet
446,It's 24 episodes. At least according to MAL
447,"I'd doubt it, unless they do some serious off screen building as they havent even built vacuum tubes for the phones yet."
448,"Oh no, is it gonna end just as they make the cellphones? Please don't do this to me"
449,They would have to skip a lot to end at a satisfying ending for the season. I hope we get an OVA or something at least. The cliff hanger is going to be insane.
450,Jump Festa is just around the corner and it wouldn't surprise me if we get a season 2 announcement just after this one ends and then a trailer in Jump Festa. Hopefully they repeat what happened with We Never Learn and the second season comes quickly.
451,Do we know anything about a season 3 for We Never Learn?
452,"Sadly, nothing. The manga seems to be just a handful of months away from ending so unless they announce something soon I would guess that there will be no third season."
453,That does make me sad. I'm loving the show
454,Yes. Same here. Also the pace the show is having also tells me they know they don’t have another chance. You have no idea how many things were skipped to reach the chapters for this and next week’s episodes. The leap was gigantic.
455,"Should I read the manga then? I wasn't going to if there was going to be a third season, but maybe now I should"
456,Either wait one more week and read it all or rad up to chapter 86 and then watch next week’s episode to finish the arc in the anime and then continue.
457,Gen is a genius If you think about all that math he had to do to find out Senku's birthday
458,Of course he is. He's a master 'psychic' and stage magician. That requires some quick memorizing and math skills IRL.
459,"God dammit Magma, they're minerals"
460,"Another fantastic episode. Man, I am legit loving every episode.    Before series started, I loved the premise and it was so good. I thought it got a little slow during the middle of the series, but for like 8 episodes now, it has been so damn good.    Gen is so damn likable. One of the best characters.    Also, the Magma scene was a little confusing. Was he originally going to try and kill Senkuu? Why did he change his mind? I could tell he was trying to save him from falling in the pit but they made it seem like something happened that caused him to change his mind about killing him."
461,"Magma wasn't trying to kill Senku. He was trying to prevent him from falling into the pit. When Senku was trying to pull him out, Magma was spouting off insults and claiming he was trying to kill Senku because Magma knew that Senku didn't have the strength to pull him out. Magma wanted Senku to save himself and drop him in the pit, hence he tried to convince Senku to drop him."
462,What about after though? When he swings at the rock?    He keeps mentioning how he was going to kill him? Like it was just a weird scene.
463,He's a tsundere
464,"Was about to say that, but you said it already, lol. Magma is the ultimate tsundere just like our Tohsaka Rin."
465,"He was insulted and ashamed that Chrome still viewed him as a murderer, so he was both testing Senku and also showing that he  could  kill them if he wanted to, but Senku trusted him."
466,The way the music suddenly cut off when talking about the treasure of friendship was amazing.
467,"Show up to learn some science, get jebaited with feels instead.."
468,I mean the Senku - Magma fan fiction writes itself
469,The real Tungsten was the friends we made along the way
470,This is a very heartwarming episode.
471,Magma best girl.     Everyone working hard to give senku a gift and his reaction was so genuinely done. Idk why I had a feeling it's going to be new year celebration or senku birthday party but still the scene was heartfelt.
472,I was pleasantly surprised that me and Senkuu share the same birthday!
473,The sound senkuu made when he caught magma was the highlight of the episode.
474," The true treasure, was friendship all along! "
475,Anime having emotive moments without being cringy is hard but this show delivers
476,Chrome tried to do nakama power lol it was a fun episode with some doses of cringe - the good kind.
477,We are all cringy on this cringy day.
478,"the tube was the first time i reacted like senku and chrome to something in this show once i figured out how it worked. it's so simple water falling out of the tube via gravity forms a vaccuum or at least low pressure environment, which sucks the higher pressure water from the tub into the sub like an actual vaccuum cleaner while being something i never would have figured out.    i was able to recreate it with a straw and a pot it's still going, which seems like a pretty cool trick to show people. espicially if a child is ever bored in a restaurant i can do something cool as long as i figure out somewhere to spew the water. so far i've at least impressed a cat with it."
479,I use it when i clean my aquarium
480,"if you think about it we use it all the time. i figured out what it's called and it's a siphon.     the tube lets you spew liquid until the reservoir reaches the same height as the output. plumbing apparently works without electricity because the water is kept in an elevated tower, which means it's still able to reach the house. the exception are people who live in a high rise apartment, as they use an electric pump to make it able to reach the higher floors.    according to the wiki article there is also a way to get higher than the source without electricity, which is to make it fall and rise. when the liquid falls it generates enough force to push the smaller volume of liquid ahead of it, which if i'm understanding right makes it sputter out. i guess it would freak people out if their sink or shower did this and that's why they use a pump in high rises."
481,"Damn Mentalist, even though I had a vague idea of birthday celebration but the way he asked indirect days was awesome!"
482,I am really deeply moved by the amount of care the villagers have shown to senku. This was so sweet!
483,I'm surprised rope wasn't a fundamental thing they brought. Still really cool how they filled that hole up with water though haha
484,"Ah yes, the real nature's treasure were the friends we made along the way"
485,Beautiful friendship 😭😭
486,What chapters did this episode cover?
487,55-56
488,Gen is a pretty great character. It'll only get better from here.
489,This shit is so close to the end 1st season what a shame.
490,Damn Senku's birthday is one day after mine
491,Supposivly the anime is gonna be done by ep 24. Sad to know its gonna last 2 more eps.
492,I always loved how they portrayed Gen in OP 2. Such a nice boi
493,They translated Senku's math for the siphon! That was an excellent touch. I had to pause and read through it. Great tangential learning opportunity. I hope Crunchyroll keeps doing it.
494,I cried dude.
495,Every episode is a joy to watch for manga readers. That THICK LINEART. ☘️
496,Aw yeah Magma part of the crew now.
497,The real tungsten they found was the friends they made along the way
498,I'm wondering in real life what the purity of a rock formation like that would be. Would all the rare minerals only make up a small percent as the majority would be limestone?
499,"You guys are going to hate me, but earlier during the episode, I literally spit my drink when Magma threw Chrome off of the ladder"
500,They tried REALLY hard to make us think anything bad is going to happen.
501,"Wow, the unexpected feels hit me like a truck would hit an isekai MC."
502,250 comments and 1.1k upvotes already? Damn
503,"I can't believe I guessed that it would be for his birthday, then I started to almost second guess myself. I think at the whole 3 days from now part and the blindfold. More shocked that he thought they'd turn him over.    I can already hear the ship builders in here.    They really.    Ye."
504,Why Did Magma and Thorkell from Vinland saga basically have the same line. “I kill if you do something lame” lmaoo
505,I was hoping he'd say you're my grandson or something to magma
506,"Magma: throws chrome up in the air without anything to step on, violating at least 3 laws of mechanics     Me: that was not very science of you"
507,"Don't look up ""synchronized swimming"" and ruin it for yourself."
508,Which ones?
509,My heart can’t take how cute this shit is. Like imagine getting a gift after 3000 years. This anime makes me so fuckin happy. Happy birthday senku !!!!
510,it really irks me how they keep saying cellphones even though they are clearly making a radio.
511,That's because the target audience probably hasn't seen a normal phone or a radio in their lives. I've almost never seen those in years.
512,they have never once sat inside a car?
513,A car radio its certainly different from a two way communication device
514,That comment itself is reason enough.
515,"I mean, it's the exact same thing, just going in one direction."
516,"a car radio is much closer to a two way radio than a cellphone is.    unless Senku is setting up cell towers, then it isn't a cellphone. the cell towers are how it gets the name."
517,This series is an absolute masterpiece
518,The anime: look magma has made some character development!    The fans: lol senku and magma ship
519,I just caught up with the manga it was pretty good
520,"""An even more precious treasure. The treasure of friendship."" Goddammit, Chrome! I was gonna say that & now I can't. Thanks for nothing."
521,"Gen may not be scientific genius like Senku, but he's a genius nonetheless.    In terms of intelligence, it's probably Senku, followed by Gen, then Chrome.    Tsukasa is probably above Chrome if we're counting the other camp.    Great episode. Magma pulled through, and was even part of the surprise.    The village is truly united behind Senku, and it's lovely.    With the fact that we only have 2 episodes left, it's going to stop right before the 2 camps clash, aren't we?    Also, Senky and Magma's reaction to Chrome's cringy statement was perfect."
522,This anime is consistently getting better every episode. Down to the last 2 ep for the season but looking forward for S2 soon!
523,"this show just knocks it out of the park with emotional moments, that was great seeing the village come together for senku's birthday. gen and magma just gained major points this episode. been very surprised by how much i'm enjoying this show"
524," SHARKFACE IS SUCH A GOOD BOY        feelsgoodman      Ok Magma time to prove yourself.      Sharkface telling Magma something?  Also Sharkface why you want Senku gone?      Hmmm... in suspicious of Magma but i really hope he can redeem himself here.      Oh shit he saved Senku!  It seems like he isnt that bad just sucks at communicating.      And they both fell in, shit...      Fill the hole with Water?  Monkey.... this will take forever lol      OH SHIT IMPROMTU WATER PUMP!?      Yep even the real world needs strong people for hard jobs.      Oh damn Magna threw Senku out the hole too, what a good guy.      HOLD EACH OTHER FOR BODY HEAT HAHAHHAHAHA      Skarn Deposite?  A spiral rock with lots of diff minerals?  Oh i see so its a lot of diff stuff merged together.      Even the Monkey is apologizing to magma now.  At least he did that.      Oh so Sharkface made a deal with Magma?  Bring Senku back by day 3?      Did Sharface make a telescope and an observatory on top of the Science house?      SHARKFACE YOU FUCKING HERO!  ITS SENKU'S BIRTHDAY!  EVERYONE HELPED BUILD IT!      SHARKKFACE IS IS BEST BOY!      Wait sharkface counted out his birthday with that number of days he was born?      Senku had written the day on the tree when he woke up, of course he did haha.      Man Sharkface really pulling out all the stops today, this man earned that Cola!"
525,"I remember Magma can't swim can he? The instant Chrom borrowed water from the river I expected the plot employs to develop his character.    Anyway great episode and I start to like Magma, as he is converted to Senku by power of science and Senku's leadership, not simply overpowering him with power."
526,"No, Ishigami village is a fishing village, everybody can swim."
527,"""The treasure of friendship.""    You're in the wrong place for that. Get that friendship nonsense out of my anime about rebuilding civilization."
528,Chrome would make a great shonen protagonist.
529,I'm not ashamed to admit that the end of this weeks episode had me in tears
530,such a fun episode
531,6268 ... what scientific constant is that referring to? I forget.
532,I'm a bit confused on part with the hole. Wasn't Magma initially planning to betray? So why did he sacrifice himself to try prevent Senku from falling into the pit?
533,Because his instinct was to protect.
534,"I thought that Gen used his mentalist skills and convinced them to turn against senku and kill him, but everything turned out fine and im glad, too. And we saw that Magma cares for Senku by trying to save him from falling."
535,"so what changed magmas mind about killing those 2 in the cave? at first it seemed like w.e the mentalist said was it but after learning what he told magma, it didnt really make sense.  did magma just like the stuff senku has been inventing and would like to see more of it?"
536,"Yes, Magma later admits the things Senkuu makes are cool. He's still not giving up on the chief position. But there is no ""need"" to kill Senkuu over it."
537,"Anyone else reading the manga to keep up and miss all the ""BAAADs"" from Chrome?      ;    Or is it just me."
538,another great episode 🙌
539,"What I don't like from the episode is too much hint about magma is pushing to save, not to trap"
540,Caught up to the anime after binging the other episodes. Now to read the manga
541,God I love Gen's voice actor so much
542,Im so far behind on everything
543,I CRIED WHEN THEY TOOK HIS BLINDFOLD OFF AND HE SAW THE TELESCOPE HOLY FRICK
544,They can very clearly see Saturn with their homemade telescope and no one even mentions it
545,"Great, now cut it with the feels and back to the sciency stuff, you're not too close to building your phone."
546,Man that ending got me in the feels    I love the love among everyone
547,"Holy shit.    This is my AOTY. I know, I know, Demon Slayer... but once again this show has captured my heart.    That surprise at the end for Senku actually got a gasp out of me. And then I cried. Fuck.    There is something seriously so magical about this show. I'm not ready for this season to end."
548,"If that's any help, the next seasons are going to make this one look  like a weak effort."
549,"Yeah, this was a good episode but I think the more emotional moments didn't hit as hard for as I bet it will for others. Maybe it's because I've already read what happens here in the magna or I just don't care for Magma even when he's a good guy, I just didn't have an overall reaction. It's sweet that Get would go this far just for a birthday present and even though he states that it would useful against Tsukasa but in reality, I bet he loves it. It's moments like these that make the show whole I guess. If it was just Senku and the crew just making shit and none of the substance like the telescope or the New Years moment, it would've lost some of it's charm.     Though I will agree with Senku and Magma that what Chrome said was pretty cringe. Almost as cringe as Ginro saying meme."
550,"Apparently ""Kimochi warui"" means ""cringy"" now. Thanks CR, glad you didn't sub End of Evangelion."
551,"It's a good translation IMO, since  Kimochi warui  or  Kimo  is kind of a catch all term for negative reception or impressions."
552,"Exactly. Closest to an exact translation would be 'I feel sick' but it's used to describe a feeling. So any translator would have to use the situation to pretty much describe the feeling.     So i think ""Cringey"" is a fair word to use imo."
553,"""Gross"" would have also worked, in my opinion. Perhaps ""creepy"", but that has different implications."
554,"Yeah, I don't know much but I always see that word translated to gross, creepy, and such. A lot of people don't even like the usage of the word cringe."
555,Cringy is never a fair word to use
556,FeelsBadMan
557,What's wrong with this translation?
558,"It just feels out of place to be inserting modern slang in there.    It kinda worked for the friendship scene since that was lighthearted and meta anyway, but for the ending scene it felt really awkward. ""Cheesy"" would have been a better fit, easily.    It comes across as ""hello, fellow kids"""
559,"Modern slang is already in the show. Chrome already uses a slang form of “yabai” which literally means dangerous but is used by most young people as a slang “yabe” as an expletive like “fuck”. It can be used as a word for amazing or surprising or super or whatever.       Both “yabe” and “kimochi warui” are used often when people are joking around with their friends, in this case, the latter is used to show disgust jokingly. Cringy is a pretty apt translation since it portrays the exact thing that the speakers are trying to portray.           Also, I’d argue that “cheesy” is a wrong translation for that word. It doesn’t mean cheesy, wtf?           Source: I’m Japanese."
560,"Not Japanese, but looked it up when the scan translators used various different   ways of translating it. I always thought that 'bad-ass!' or 'fukken awesome!' would be good ways of keeping the idiom.    'You bang them together, heat them up, grind them into powders. When something totally bad-ass happens, that's sorcery!'"
561," Cringy is a pretty apt translation since it portrays the exact thing that the speakers are trying to portray.     Except that no one uses ""cringy"" in the way it was used at the end of the episode.    Just because it might work in japanese, doesn't mean it works in english.     Also, I’d argue that “cheesy” is a wrong translation for that word. It doesn’t mean cheesy, wtf?     Cheesy can be the same thing as cringy in a lot of scenarios, but with less vitriol. Even just ""lame"" would be better.     Source: I’m Japanese.    Good for you, you know japanese better than me. I'm a native english speaker, so I know english better than you."
562,"  I'm a native english speaker, so I know english better than you.    Lmao imagine honestly thinking that."
563,"He's allowed to say that for japanese, but I am not for english?     Makes perfect sense."
564,"Idk man you pointing out its some fellow kids stuff feels pretty ""hello fellow kids"" itself lmao"
565,...how?    In what way does what I said express a disingenuous and out of touch appeal to the youth?
566,Because you pointing that out sounds a lot like some boomer who just found out the hello fellow kids meme and now you're trying to sound cool and hip because you know about this meme
567,I was memeing when that meme was created my dude.    It's a popular way to express such a sentiment.
568,Ok boomer
569,"all your rental property are belong to us, zoomer"
570,feelsbadman
571,"Well for starters, it's not the original meaning. It's like translating ""kawaii"" to ""bae"""
572,"That's a dumb explanation, you don't always translate every word literally"
573,"in jav videos, kimochi means like something good"
574,"It's not  kimochi , it's  kimochi-ii  it's actually all together but I separated so it's easier to see.     Kimochi  means feeling,  ii  means good and  warui  is bad."
575,It's them taking liberties again and using currently popular terms instead of 100% accurate ones but at least it's not necessarily a wrong translation
576,Senku and Magma: why are you gay?
577,Dr. Stone has a 10 billion percent chance of making you cry every episode
578,cried at the last scene.     I am so attached to this anime its amazing.
579,"I hope they dont rush the rest of this. Theres only 2 episode left until the end, unless they make the last episodes 1 hour long i dont see how they can adapt the rest of the arc without skipping a lot"
580,"Well they definitely aren't getting as far into it as some predicted early on, but I think they'll still hit the point that I bet they would end on."
581,"Guys...we might not be getting a season 2. Dr. Stone blue ray sales are doing extremely poorly right now. Apparently, they only sold 614 copies, and the blue rays have been out for a little over a month now. It's not looking good.    I can't post links right now because i'm on my phone, but the website is someanithing.com for those interested."
582,"Terrible blu ray sales never stopped One Piece. People just don't buy shonen on blu ray, especially ongoing shonen."
583,"True, and does anyone buy  anything  on Blu-Ray these days? Physical media is on its way out. I have not bought a DVD, CD or Blu-Ray disc in at least a decade. I would guess they probably make more money licensing the show to streaming services than disc sales. I do hope there is a season 2 in any case, this show is great."
584,"The BRDs sell for 60 a disc and contain less than an hours worth of content. The issue, again, is genre. Shonen anime don't sell yet your bog standard idol show will sell by the truckload, especially if you include some character goods."
585,"Japan still uses a handful of physical media. The number of bluray sales are never  super  high, but people still buy them in Japan. Personally I think the issue is the super high pricing, it makes it so that basically the only reason to buy them is if you really like the show and you want to support it/get a collector's item. But I can understand why they're hesitant to lower the price, since they need to sell the inverse of the ratio in order for this strategy to make the same amount of money and that's a risk"
586,Not enough porn in it to justify the blurays.
587,I'm surprised none of them were harmed by falling into that hole. With a fall from that height you'd at least expect a broken bone or two. Even Senku got out of it without a scratch despite his fragility.
588,Naaww
589,Why am I going to cry
590,"I liked this part in the manga more, it was actually not clear whether or not Magma was trying to kill Senku or not. Here it was way too obvious with the crack being brought to our attention and Magma's pained expression"
591,"Gonna miss the wholesomeness of this show every Friday, manga here I come"
592,I love this series so much. It knows how to make me laugh and cry all in one episode.
593,It seemed really uncharacteristic of Senku to accuse everyone of betraying him.. and nobody acknowledged it or took offense in any way.
594,"The episode is titled Treasure, how absolutely fitting. Gosh, this may have been my favorite episode yet.     The episode by itself my not seem like much but it's the payoff of watching to this point that makes this episode so magical. I'm a sucker for plot lines with the bad guy being won over by the good guy. Seeing how the strongest man of the village Magma who wanted Senku dead, now has come to grow some respect for Senku is big. The adventures in the cave with Magma, Senku, and Chrome were a nice turning point. Senku stressed how the strong and weak need each other and showed how he cared for Magma through his actions. Magma constantly provoked Senku with lies but Senku never bit on any of it. And I think that's when Magma realized that Senku was someone he could respect.     After that... Gen secretly making a surprise birthday gift for Senku along with the whole village was the best part. And it wasn't just any gift, it was make-shift telescope that Senku absolutely adores. You could see how genuinely happy Senku was. They created an observatory just for him. That moment at the end with Senku, Gen, and the villagers under the starry night sky was so precious. Oh how far they've come.     Wow. I love this series."
595,How does knowing age and date that he left the cage help figuring out his  birthday? Doesn’t make much sense to me.
596,Such a good episode!
597,Ahh the science boys are sooo all over the rocks! That's cute.    WOW I love Chrome but with this Gen won the best boy race. He's the best. I love shrewd characters like him that are kinda superficial but nice to the ones they care about.
598,"I just finished watching episode 22 , and I want to start reading the manga.    Does anyone know which chapter should i start with?"
599,So Magma won me over this episode  for some strange reason I get a goku/vegeta vibe between him and Senku's relationship now.
600,cringe
601,"Around the middle of the episode, I was like “o shit is Gen about to kill them?”        Then at the end of the episode, it was very wholesome."
602,"Bro, they just posted cringe, they are going to lose subscriber"
603,"Man, this episode was so wholesome."
604,The episode felt a bit fillery. Considering there are only two more left this season I really didn't think they'd spend the whole episode getting the minerals. Are they trying to not start in the next arc before next season?
605,It faithfully follows the manga. And hopefully they announce a 12 episode season 2 to finish the arc
606,"It was a bit fillery, but it was the right kind of filler. Without it, it would have been ""Oh, those rocks that we discovered last time? Yeah, we got a whole load of them while the screen faded to black""."
607,You just posted cringe bro
608,I still don't trust Gen
