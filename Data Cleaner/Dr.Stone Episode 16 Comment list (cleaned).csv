1,Did anyone notice this small tease they added?
2,"I saw that and was like “Aaayyy, that’s later”"
3,I was wondering if that was her since I couldn't remember her exact design.  Nice addition.
4,Tsukasa and Taiyu walking past each other was also a nice touch.
5,"Ooh, nice catch!"
6,"Instead of rushing through the content like I expected, they're expanding on it. Now I wonder where they'll end the season. Also Nikki tease."
7,Anyone else irritated by Biyakuya's voice? .
8,"A little bit, but I'll be used to it soon.    Definitely my least favorite of the cast though, in terms of voice acting."
9,was very surprised to hear him as keiji fujiwara. even though he spoke in an earlier episode i completely forgot and i read the manga imagining him as rikiya koyama.    i like keiji but its just not really fitting imo
10,"  ""did they say he was his real dad opposed to being his step dad as in the manga?"""
11,It'll be in next week's pre-op scene.
12,"I'd thought the manga mentioned it around here too, but I think the anime actually mentioned it way earlier, and that surprised me when watching it. I think it's in like the first five episodes, but it's offhand enough that most people wouldn't notice."
13,"I was already tearing up at the despair they must feel seeing humanity wiped out.  ""when the sickness comes"" I'm going to be a blubbering mess."

Another thing is that, most of the scientists or professionals in today's world won't be able to create things from scratch.    I am an engineer myself, I know how to build a circuit board from scratch given the right tools.  But if I need to find elements, metals, generate electricity from 0. I am pretty sure it will take me years or more to create one.    Well, most of the 'plot holes' you have mentioned will be most likely be answered next episode.

28,"I’m getting low key pissed about this, so I need to know.    Are they going to make Senkuu and Kohaku related?! I shipped them so hard, and am about to be so pissed if they go down this route."
29,I mean the genetics after this much shuffling in this many generations. After all in some way of form many people in world are related.
30,"I guess that’s a fair point. I just can’t help but be a little mad about it.    The author definitely knew everyone was shipping them, like why even make it happen this way? There probably would have been many ways to make it so they weren’t related at all."
31,"I feel like you are overthinking it a bit. You can't be sure you are not related with someone by in a distant way. Same here, nothing weird about it, but I hope you will enjoy whatever you want."
32,You  can  be sure you are related to every human on Earth. 100%.
33,Exactly this. Go far enough back and we're all incestuous.
34,"Just cause people choose to ship them, doesn't mean the author has to change their entire idea about the story lol shipping isn't important in a series like this"
35,Bruh Senku and Kohaku are so many generations apart they might as well be from completely different family lines.
36,"That is true, but I can’t help but a little mad it happened this way.    Like they could have picked an entirely different way so they wouldn’t be related."
37,If you can't help but feel mad then you should get some help.
38,Dude I don't want to be rude but your comments make you sound like a basement-dwelling neckbeard who plays doll house with anime characters. Chill out.
39,"3700 years apart, it really doesn't matter lmao    The bigger issue would've been repopulation in the immediate following generations and you  bet  there would've been a shit ton of incest going on well not like they had a choice. Given scientists estimate a minimum viable population of 50-500 humans is needed to repopulate the Earth, humanity surviving with just 6 is already a miracle in of itself.     ""And no, Byakuya's actually Senku's adoptive father"""
40,It probably helps that they're from all over the globe. They would have relatively distinct genomes.
41,"Yeah, I guess that’s fair.    I am just kind of more upset this is the route they chose. I thought maybe some people un-petrified early on and started a civilization.    Because of this route, even if it’s not a big deal, it still makes Kohaku and Senkuu a tiny bit related. When they could have avoided it all together."
42,"By a ""tiny bit related"" you mean as related as you and I. It's a BIG difference. The generation gap is as big as from now to 1700 BC. Senku is as related to Kohaku as much as you're related to some Egyptian Pharaoh thousands of years ago."
43,"Some people may have un-petrified by themselves too, just like Senku did, but much earlier."
44,"Well there's a 3,700 difference between Senku and Kohaku if they were related."
45,"Later on Senku actually  ""it's not like anyone's related after that many generations."""
46,       
47,"Besides all the things people already said, that's his step-dad, so they wouldn't even be """"""""related"""""""". Maybe the author did it this way because of people that wouldn't understand time, like yourself. But I haven't read much into the manga to know if it's a plot point or not."
48,"Man now that we know the true meaning behind the ED, it becomes 10,000,000,000 times sadder, over 3,000 years ago Senku's father left to go to space, the petrification hit and now he will never see him again because he probably died long ago assuming he didn't get petrified which I doubt happened if the village is named after him"
49,"Still, what a dad!     umucool"
50,I wish my father was like his...
51,Indeed he's a fantastic father and perhaps the best one among the currently published WSJ series. A real role model.
52,Sounds like the plot of a movie.    No offense meant
53,I've seen it on PH
54,rcursedcomments
55,"Yeah, and in the movie, you get to inherit half a billion dollars."
56,Or you learn that your father was actually part of a secret organisation and now inherit his mission.
57,If it was an anime his half sister would have the hots for him...
58,"Dang man, I’m sorry to hear that. Just curious, did you ever go back to see him after he passed ?"
59,See him after he passed? There isn't much to see if he's dead.
60,"You can see him at the wake. That is to say, attend his funeral."
61,"You can see a corpse. Which isn't something I'd consider to be meaningful interaction.    Regardless, I was just poking fun at his wording. I kind of feel like ""did you ever go back"" isn't really the correct way to phrase it. Makes it sound like it was more than just a one-time possibility."
62,not to be insensitive but rthisisawendys
63,Half-sister is legal in some countries. Just sayin.
64,Best comment out of the thread right here.
65,Sounds like my dad. He abandoned us when I was 8 to live with someone who had 5 kids from her previous marriage. I've only learned that things didn't worked out a year later but imagine being this fucking stupid.
66,The earliest memory I have is standing in the train station with my mom as what I assume is my father leaving on the train for good.  He abandoned us when I was like 4.
67,I wish my father was...
68,I wish I'd still have a father
69,"First hint that he would be a great dad, they got best dad for his voice"
70,010 didn't threaten nearly enough children with a gun
71,"You can really see the resemblance.    Their joy for science.    Their drive to push themselves.    And when it comes down to it, they won't wait around for help.    They will be the ones helping, saving humanity being their goals.    3,000 years apart, and they both came to the same conclusion.    They had to save the human race, or at least try.    Mad respect for them."
72,"It is really disturbing that I knew you were the one who wrote this comment without looking at your username. At first it's just something you notice, but now I don't even need to look up the username. It's like a well-oiled machine, same reactions, same structures, same jokes."
73, 
74,Ging looks a little different than usual.
75,All the astronauts looks vaguely like the people in the village. So I'm assuming that is the case.
76,"Also based on the interactions between his Dad and the singer, it seems extremely likely that Kohaku is Senku's like 1000x removed niece, which is kinda funny."
77,unless his dad died without getting more children basically all the villagers would be niecesnephews of some sort now
79,Like two or three lines since after 3K years blood relations doesn't mean anything.
80,"It's 3k years with a very small starting gene pool, though."
81,"No, after so many generations, the DNA genome would have through meiosis so many times it would be irrecognizable, Iirc after 200 years it's entirely different, if after 3k years DNA ancestry remained the same, most people would be directly related"
82,Yeah but artistic license. Plus if they had a lot of children and a meticulous breeding plan they could probably have enough generations with no inbreeding to minimize the risks.
83,It would be like fucking with Eve.
84,I really had to repress my urge to state that you need at least 50 unique individuals to keep a species going. I can accept the movie logic here. I just need to plug my ears a little.
85,"Senku: ""Well given that all organisms share a common ancestor anyway, there's no problem."""
87," ""senku isn't actually related to Byakuya. He's adopted."""
88,"That's incredibly stupid considering how similar they look in the anime. Same eyes, similar hair, similar bone structure. Hopefully they drop that nonsense."
89,"My guess was that the drawings and plot were already made, but then Boichi realized ""wait, no. That's incest"" and changed Senku's dad to be adoptive."
90,But... so many generations... also Japan.
91,"""Also Japan"" that had me dying"
92,It might've also been a suggestion by the editor or something
93," ""It’s obviously more than nonsense. As in, Senku’s biological father will totally be important later in the game, to not say he’s likely related to the petrification. With how ridiculously intelligent Senku is, that’s totally gonna happen.""    Not gonna deny that making them so physically similar is pretty silly, though."
94,"well, assuming no other 'survivors' you have three breeding pairs.    assuming senku's dad got it on at all with any of the three, their children almost certainly got it on with the others, because super closed gene pool.    like at first everything would be 'okay'. The children of those 6 would not be born of incest, and nor would the children of that generation. And perhaps by gen 3 post petrify they could be VERY careful and avoid incest for another generation.    But after that, all the survivors will be reasonably closely related. the greatest distance you could reasonably expect by that point is to have a common ancestor with any mate no further than 3 generations back.    You'd have a LOT of recessive gene expression and after 3000 years of this, it's really a surprise that there aren't a huge amount of genetic abnormalities and that they all don't look almost identical with one another like seriously, they should all have the same eye color, hair color, skin tone, physical built traits and they should all look distinctly mixed heritage since the six survivors were all of differing nationalities. There should be almost zero diversity among them,        EDIT: the lowest starter population i could find was Tristan de Cunha, an island that was settled by 8 men and 7 women."
95,"Well this show has been stretching all of its science so far, so I'm fine with this too. It's a story, not real life, so it can bend the rules as much as it wants as long as it doesn't break. The execution of everything being fantastic also helps."
96,wouldn't it be his step-sister?
97,No it would be his half sisters great x a bunch granddaughter.
98,God fucking damn it Japan.
99,"No.    Also, she's not a singer, and American."
100,"It seems like what they’re saying is that the crew of the ISS at the time of the incident are the ones who founded that village long ago. So yeah, I’d say Byakuya is definitely dead by now, that village is multiple generations old. At Max, thousands of years old. Which would explain why the village knows nothing of science or why there are petrified people scattered across the world."
101,One of the greatest anime Dads ever
102,"To be fair, the competition's not great. There's a show this season where the mc's parents sold him to a demon."
103,Dororo?
104,"No, mairimashita! Iruma-kun. It's a comedy from this season."
105,"But like 3000 years and no advancements even though they started off with a bunch of scientists and doctors? And they still kept  blond hair on the girls even though they marry whoever is the ""strongest"" which would obv lead to non blonde children eventually. Idk man. THe whole time i'm just like...well for a science heavy show this sure is stupid."
106,"I think the prominence of blonde-ness is probably the most unscientific part of this show. Blonde hair is a recessive gene, dominant only over red. It's very peculiar that given any amount of inbreeding over 3000 years that so many of their prominent leaders would remain blonde.    But I dunno, lots of anime weirdly obsessed with the blonde hair blue eyes thing."
107,     Quite the opposite! Inbreeding actually increases the chances of offspring being affected by recessive traits.
108,"Your source makes sense in the context of isolated populations where we do not know the characteristics of the population.    In this instance, we can pretty clearly see that there are fo blonde people, with four of them having hair colors that are dominant to the recessive blonde gene.    Only one of the couples would be strictly blonde - the other two you can pretty trivially do a punnet square and see that the odds are pretty low. I think in general you have a point, but for this characteristic with this sample size, it still isn't terribly likely."
109,Reminder Human Genetics way more complex than the recessivedominant nature of of Pea Genetics. Don't use what most are taught on Genetics to figure out your outcomes. Some high level math gets involved.   Not giving opinion on the blondness chance over all but note the trait showed up and spread over a fairly large population so it's not Pea Genetics at play.
110,"I've done some open source work for computational genomics repositories I'm a software engineer by trade and the link you're talking about is purely statistical. Yes, for many traits it is not as black and white in terms of which genes are present, but the term ""recessive"" does not necessarily mean rare.    This is  not  a fairly large population that is being influenced. It's six individuals. In reality, the number of genes required to produce blondeness likely happened as a mutation over a much larger sample than this - there's a decent amount of research on it.     So while I'm not saying it's impossible, I am saying that it's statistically and computationally unlikely to be expressed in this manner - especially with the trait being so consistent in terms of political power in the anime. I'm going to have to go with anime plot jutsu on this one."
111,Everyone on the ISS was blonde except for Byakuya.
112,Uh...    This is just not true.    I'll let you rewatch the episode.
113,Ok 46. That's still more than enough for them to have blond descendents.
114,"That's not how genetics works.    46 are blonde, but 23 of the couples contain dominant genes for hair color that is  not blonde . That means the likelihood is  much  lower than your perceived 67%, because both Senku's dad and the other Japanese lady would pass down dominant genes for black hair. Blondeness is a little more complicated than that, but note it's also a mutation.    Coupled with the fact that the flashbacks indicate that somehow every priestess has been blonde as a callback to the original singer, that the position of power is determined by the ""fittest"" which  absolutely  ought to deviate from just blonde out of pure statistical chance, there really isn't any point trying to argue the soundness of this development. Just accept that it's an anime pull and be done with it."
115,"      When was this shown? I might have missed it. Both Ruri and her mom were blond, but that isn't that unlikely of a coincidence given that the father was also blond. Also the other dark haired lady was American, so she possibly had some recessive blond genes as well."
116,"It actually makes perfect sense. With such a small starting population, the amount of inbreeding would be enormous, thereby increasing the likelihood of recessive traits manifesting."
117,"This ep is kinda sad  I gotta say I watch this show for its good comedy and new discoveriesinnovationsnew old stuff they make, so this ep kinda hit me in the feels unexpectedly. Hopefully we return to the gang next ep and have a more cheerful tone, because this is the series that cheers me up at the end of the week"

Best, he at least visited the Senku statue. Tho thinking about it, if his dad did return Senku ""should"" have been moved significantly closer to the village Again, all speculation via the anime as I haven't read ahead, yet."

127,"Man, I love Lillian's design and attitude. Those pouts and soft punches are great"
128,Well we see where the sisters got it from.       feelsgoodman
129,Look at those     squee
130,In that first one she looks so much like Launch its crazy.       awe
131,Just like Toriyama I forgot she was a character
132,F
133,The first Super Saiyan
134,Kohaku takes all the anger and both sisters shares equally cuteness
135,"Love the resemblence to Kohaku and Ruri, the flirting was the best part of this ep haha"
136,But the voice swaps! When she sings compared to when she speaks sounds like 2 different people
137,I'd be willing to bet that it  is  two different people.
138,"This makes Senku, Kohaku's Great great x30 Uncle?"
139,When the village chief makes you marry your great x 30 niece
140,The villagers are all probably more closely related to each other than Senku is to them
141,"Yup.     Mamallians and other complex animals in general have a biologicalgenetically mechanicsm that erases incest traces from within a species after a large ammount of time so it can get rid of genetically deformities, so Kohaku and Ruri are probably not related to Senku anymore biologically speaking     "
142,"Dude. The least amount of people that need to repopulate the Earth without getting genetic defects is at least 500+ but the most preferable is around 1000+.       Six people is not even barely enough for that, I'm surprised that the villagers have no major defects or haven't been killed off by diseases due to bad immunity from the inbreeding for more than 3000 years. Unless Senku's dad has discovered to alter genetics prior to dying or something."
143,no major defects? have you seen kohaku's eyes?
144,RIP best girl
145,I wonder if there are burn centers for such a roast in the stone world
146,THANK YOU. i've always said that the eyes in this show were friggin weird.
147,Boichi has a weird way of drawing faces. I was reading Wallman and felt the same way.
148,"Not quite true, you can see in this episode their ancestor had the same eyes, and Senku described the villagers eyes as being ""foreign"", not deformed. Since their ancestor is American and perceived to be an attractive one too, they are suggesting thats how all Americans look in this anime. Given the... general remarks on relative eye size between Europeans and Asians, it's not too hard to guess why the Japanese artists went with abnormally big eyes on the American characters."
149,"lol I wasn't being serious, just a joke about the animation choice to make their eyes so far apart"
150,So this is why characters from this show are designed as if they are deformed.
151,"Bad eyesight is the least of your problems, I would have believe that bad eyesight was then a minor problem in around 300 years not 3000 years, they're lucky enough that they can still procreate active humans and not dying by stillbirth."
152,Kohaku doesn't have bad eyesight. That's not what shehe was referring to.
153,"In fact, bad eyesight is   the least   of her problems, story-wise and design wise."
154,Eyes? With just 6 people the offsprings would degenerate back to neandertal state or simply die because of organ failures
155,This is false.
156,"Yup, those guys"
157,"I get where are you coming from, moreover Ishigami village is not even a hundred people strong by the looks of it, but wasn't it common in ancient times or perhaps even today to have simmilary large villages or communities live separately from outer world, like some Amazonian, African or old Celtic village. I never heard about inbreeding problems from them, only times I recall were Europian nobility inbreeding in a single family. In any case starting from 6 people is most likely an anime logic stretch, though they were all international plus healthy astronauts, if that counts."
158,"     Those tribescommunities live separately, but they frequently come in contact within one another to exchange people to marry off."
159,What about small islands
160,Small island populations are very vulnerable thanks to their very tiny genetic pool. Which is why island species form a signficant percentages of total species going extinct.
161,I vaguely remember a paper showing that an outsider integrating every couple of generations would be sufficient to prevent major issues.
162,So Isekai Protagonist getting a harem is simply for the greater good of the population's genetic health?
163,Roman Egypt had a 30 percent BrotherSister marriage rate with no problems and the couple with the most lived to adult children recorded was brothersister. As the practice was common at the start of the Roman taking census it probably went thousands of years back to at least the start of the First Dynasty.  Like almost all ancient cultures they did practice killing all poor looking babies and certainly did not let older people with problems marry or breed. So that seams to be the ratio that incest can be sustained at.   Note: Thanks to hundreds of years of surviving census records plus other records the people of Roman Egypt we know more about than any other Ancient People.
164,"The Ptolemaic Dynasty by the time of the Roman conquest only ruled for a few hundred years as they were descended from the governor of Egypt after Alexander's death. So their inbreeding only went back a few generations not dozens, and they were in no way related to the first Dynasty. But you are right that inbreeding can actually propagate good traits just like bad traits, that's why Cleopatra the famous one was described as highly intelligent and amazing beautiful."
166,"The nobility in different eras did it for different but similar reasons.But they all revolved around keeping power within the family, if you get down to it."
168,Population of the village is 40
169,"It's worth considering that it's possible to have directly related humans produce offspring with no incest-related defects. The reason it's a taboo is because of the probability of problem, but it's not actually a guarantee.     That's not a sustainable probability if you're trying to repopulate, but if two people discovered they were related which can happen i.e. sperm donors or frisky postmen then it doesn't lead to disaster. In fact it's theorised due to things like infidelity in small populations that people have been born of incest without anyone ever noticing. Only when populations get TOO small that you start noticing.    Still not a good idea but typically in the world of natural selection incest is accounted for because it kills off the weakest of the family and leaves the most genetically varied alive."
170,"""The reason it's a taboo is because of the probability of problem, but it's not actually a guarantee.""  It's not a guarantee for one, two or only a few generations of incest. It is 10 billion per cent a guarantee though for  3700 years of incest. 6 people make an extremely small genetic pool. They could have stable offspring for a century, maybe two centuries tops. 3700 years are totally out of the question though, and none of them should even be alive."
171,"That's my problem too, there is no gene flow in this population.  Going down to 6 people is such a crazy bottleneck."
172,If we are assuming they somehow all make it from the Space Station to earth. Then perhaps we can imagine they found a way to unpetrify a few people too.
173,"Or a few people were unpetrified naturally. Taiju was only in the cave for 6 months before unpetrifying, its not crazy to believe other people could have done it naturally too. But then you run into the probability issue of the chances of it happening is likely but the chances of it happening near them isnt."
174,I mean historically there have been dynasties and remote tribal nations that interbreed for a LONG time. So long that we even find some of them today on isolated islands.    And it is probably taboo because of the social implications with it. If brother and sister get in a fight who do the parents support? Unless you were super rich and could just go somewhere else to avoid all the trouble. For those that can't this is a real problem.
175,        maybe the deformed offspring just died off after 3000 years
176,We do have a logic problem currently with adult family members forbidden to marry while people with severe genetic disorders who have a 50 percent chance of having children with them are allowed to marry.   Last time I looked it up brother sister had a 3 percent chance of more problems than normal people both groups having no know genetic disorder. It's the multi generations that causes problems but the Egyption Rulers inbreed constantly with problems rarely showing up so the from time to time outsider marriage for political reasons seams to work most of the time with some problems showing up but no where close to what you would think after eight or more generations of brothersister fatherdaughter marriage.
177,"     Actually apparently it's only 98 source . But ya 6 is still to little, maybe they hit up some sperm banks or something."
178,     oh god.
179,Thanks the 1000 is from the old 50500 rule which is outdated now you have to calculate a number for each individual species and some variables hard to nail down as you stated 80-160.
180,"The 500+ and 1k+ numbers are to prevent incest for a population just reproducing at random. Humans are intelligent and can do targeted reproduction to reduce genetic risks. For example, we managed to get Black Footed ferrets back up to a stable population from an 18 individuals bottleneck. It isn't ideal since genetic diversity is still very low, but they aren't suffering from genetic defects or anything.    Doing that from 6 individuals is a bit more of a puzzle, but I can see a stable population forming with a little bit of creative polygamy for the first few generations. Ideally they'd raid the sperm bank after they get back down to increase the available genetic material."
181,Frozen eggs and sperm probably survived long enough for them to literally inject some genetic diversity into the population.
182,"According to the only source I've been able to find with more details then ""it's bad"" type generalities marriage between first cousins sees an overall increase of birth defects to the tune of... 2.2 percent over the norm. Roughly equivalent to having a mother in her 40s. Not exactly the sort of terribad odds society's incest taboo would lead me to expect.     Furthermore for an extreme situation like this the difference between  optimal  and merely  viable  becomes extremely important. They don't need the best genetic health to continue the species, just have enough children to have enough children to have enough children... etc. Humanity has a long history of spawning isolated populations. Hell almost literally anywhere before the modern era would only see occasional splashes of outsider genetics when most people are dying within 25 miles of where they are born. More extreme examples would be some of the further flung island populations, the sparse remaining 'uncontacted' tribes of the world, or the descendants of the HMS Bounty mutineers. I'm not yet aware of any population that has reached a point where nobody can have kids anymore. Though of course the small crew of the ISS is going to be more extreme, but the point here is about how little they may be deviating from reality.    Hell consider that Ishigami Village just as a pre-modern society will have enormous infant mortality rates. That's the sort of thing humanity survived already.     And if nothing else there's thousands of years for someone to have been depetrified in or some never petrified population to occur. Many things are possible when a magic wave has Medusa'd Earth."
183,"What are you on about? It's pretty easy to avoid inbreeding, there's just very slim pickings for mating. They have 3 monogamous pairings, more if they intermix. Even in the first generation, each family has two other families to pick from when it comes to mating. This repeats ad-infinitum, with more and more genetic distance occurring as the population grows. It really shouldn't be a problem..."
184,"i mean, its not like the village has 7 billion people in it. perhaps the defective ones died and a few lucky ones remained."
185,"Sperm and egg banks exist my friend, if anyone could make use of them it would be 2 NASA doctors."
186,"Bro, they speak modern-day Japanese fluently after 3700 years. A millennia ago you'd have a hard time understanding any of the languages in England. Meanwhile, the villagers don't even have super-heavy Russian or American accents.     I think this show  might  be playing a little fast and loose with both genetic and linguistic evolution."
187,That part is true. Along with the women don't go topless taboo and other culture parts probably would die.   Were they got a youth fight from leader I would hope is a major mistake way after the first generation.  I can't think of any primitive tribe that used a fight to determine leaders and I have at least skimmed information on hundreds over 40 years or so.
188,this only happens if recessive traits reveal themselves. there's a total possibility that none of the 6 had recessive traits.
189,"Plus with 3,000 years of breeding, there should be a population in the millions."
190,"Sperm Banks were still functional. I really question why there wasn't like an underground base or something with nice tech, but a random uneducated village? They were doctors and professors and their progeny were just dumb cave people down the line. I guess a hurricane could have killed a lot of smart people and tablets and machines they used just stopped working without electricity."
191,Your referring to the 50500 rule which is a very rough approximation. Quick research is that it's complicated.  If you willing to kill all poor looking babies and not let anyone with a negative trait later breed you can get away with a large amount of incest and even improve the breed.  The German Shepard is the product of intense multigenerational Incest with lots of puppies drowned. It a sick disgusting read of how they made this great dog.
192,"I'm going to mention the fact that these are friggin astronauts, they tend to select against things likely to cause issues during the mission, so there would be a lower chance of genetic defects being present.  Include a wide distance between genetic samples, and you have a better spread of randomized traits for offspring."
193,Maybe there were defects and abortions early on were used regularly? Or the deformed offspring didn't reproduce?
194,"But weren't the village populated with the other astronauts with Senku's dad? If his descendants were to marry the descendants of his friends, then there would be no inbreeding."
195,Just go look for sperm banks scattered all around the world
196,"It's also possible Senku wasn't the first one to discover the means to undo petrification. Or that some humans on the surface really DID make it through staying underground or something.    Or the show's handwaving genetics, which seems off for how it normally handles such things."
197,"I think the anime signaled that science would be disreguard for plot reasons when the world got petrified in the first episode. And then Senku counted seconds for several millennia. =P Also just for fun, accuracy to 4 months would be to be counting with   "
198,"Tristan da Cunha is the lowest noted example we have irl at 8 men, 7 women, then around 1900 a russian knocked up one of the islanders. All of the women there can be traced back to one of 5 women who settled, two of whom were sisters.        270 odd people there, huge incidence of asthma which has advanced genetic profiling of the condition. But yeah, 3 of the original settlers had asthma and now almost half the existing population does.        But over a few hundred years so far nothing lethal."
199,the creator was asked about this and just kind of side stepped the question by talking about isolated communities. But yeah it is kind of bullshit. I am holding out hope that there is more to it
200,"Don't shatter my dreams! If they're not blood related, that makes it less hot."
201,      genetic
202,"It would be like, Kohaku is a descendant of Adam born around the middle ages, while Senku is Cain."
203,"Uh, no, we don't. Cheetahs for instance have extremely poor genetic diversity due to likely almost going extinct around 10,000 years ago, and are now extremely prone to disease with poor sperm quality. If what you said was true, that wouldn't be the case.    Edit: Since I'm being downvoted I guess the Senku x Kohaku shippers are salty. Regardless, no, there is no such mechanism in mammals or any complex lifeform that ""erases traces of incest,"" beyond random mutations creating differentiation and widening the gene pool. And even if that's the method uFrocharocha is talking about that process takes 10's to 100's of thousands of years for any noticeable change to be observed, not 3000 and certainly not with a population as small and genetically undiverse as Ishigami Village."
204,It does very from species to species and it would take a ton of science to determine one for humans. I see 98 above stated with link.
205,"Yeah the inbreeding coefficient in that village is likely through the roof, if anything the genes of someone one degree removed from their direct ancestor inserted into their collective gene pool would be a massive improvement.    It helps somewhat that the village descends from an international team so the initial genetic diversity was quite large, but that's not going to do much over hundreds of generations."
206,"Yo, it's not incest if you actually wait 3000 thousand years to bang your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreat    niece..."
207,This is starting to look like a school days family tree.

214,"Chrome might be a descendant of the Russian couple or the other two.    There'd still likely be common ancestors, just later down the line."
215,"yeah it's been 3000 years, everyone alive is related to whoever has an unbroken line of descendants. heck you're probably related to Charlemagne, and he was alive in 800 C.E."
216,"At last, the casus belli I've been waiting for. I ride at dawn!"
217,Just make sure to get rid of gavelkind
218,I've always wanted to be related to Keanu Reeves
219,"After 3000 years... it's likely all off them can trace descent from all 6 astronauts. How many grandparents do you have? How many great-grandparents? If the first few generations didn't have siblings marrying each other, then after a two or three generations everyone is related."
220,"SILENCE CHILDREN, THE ISHIGAMI PATRIARCH SPEAKS"
221,like this isn't already the case irl.
222,chromes more related to ruri than senku..
223,Chrome is short for Chromosome! Something I think a few generations didn't pass on.
224,   THAT'S THE BEST PART  
225,"Pulling a Fry, I see."
226,"Wouldn’t they basically be as related as two strangers on the street? I mean, I’m certainly no geneticist, but unless they kept inbreeding specifically among themselves which is both possible and likely in this scenario, they’re not that closely related, right?"
227,And more plot twist: Village Chief is also related to Senku given that it was his daughter he made Senku marry.
228,Then Alabama is happy. Roll tide!
229,"Math time: the petrification lasted 3715 years, I checked the wiki Kaseki is 60, Kohaku and Chrome are 16, if we assume they are two generations apart we can assume the average between generations for them is 22 years. Alternatively we can look at Ruri who is 18 and would have gotten married as soon as 17 and probably have kids around 18-20 considering the life span in this stone world is probably pretty short without medicine given Kaseki appears to be the oldest one anyway from this we can assume the time between generations is approximately 20 years. So if we do the math 371520 gives us 185 or 186 generations between the founders and the youngest generation. Assuming Senku's father and the others are the ones they are defended from"
230,Are you thinking of becoming astronaut immediately? That calculation deserve praise!
231,"lol, I'm considering majoring in chemistry right now, I'm good at math but have trouble getting motivated unless I have to. My Pre calc teacher last year during my senior year of high school couldn't control the class so I literally had to teach myself the entire course. I ended up getting a better grade than every other year where the teacher actually taught stuff because I ended up not studying when I thought I would get at least a B on the test."
232,"Serious recommendation.  Unless you really love chemistry, not worth doing it.  Job opportunity isn't too strong and you can't do much with a chemistry undergrad.  You will also be competing with a lot of students who aren't having a hard time staying motivated and getting a B on the test won't necessarily do.  Take your first year classes and see how you do and how much you want to get into it, but don't marry yourself to it unless you really want to do it.  For what it's worth you won't really do that much math either, some in gen chem, none in ochem, and by the time you get to pchem it's more of just understanding eigenfunctions rather than any major calculations until you go more into thermokinetics, but even then, there isn't much"
233,"Yup got a degree in Biochemistry from one of best universities out there and the job pays like shit for the amount of work and research I did. It was helpful to society but society don’t pay my bills sadly. So I ended up studying IT and tech and went I to that since that was a hobby of mine and then I made it a job and never going back on that decision. Pay, hours, benefits, interest are all better for me in this field. Honestly instead of taking first classes, I would say and do what I did but sooner and go do actually paid research or undergraduate research and compare it to other jobs and how you feel doing it."
234,Ahh so you are having fun in studies that's awesome
235,I taught myself the entire 2nd half of Calculus BC Integrals cuz I couldn't stay awake in class — college apps and math being the first period at 7am drained the fuck out of me. At least I got a 5 to flex on colleges with.
236,"I was good at math in high school. I graduated with credits in calc 3, and I instantly went and majored in chemistry. Big mistake. I had to switch to finance after two semesters and none of my credits transferred to the school I want to switch to"
237,Go into chemical engineering its more math than chemistry
238,But then typos descended...
239,"I would like to suggests that the first few generations could have lived a way longer life due to them retaining knowledge from before the petrification. The knowledge slowly got eroded over time, the only thing that was left was the 100 stories which was orally pass down by the time Senku came around."
240,"If that math is right, the village has too small of a population. A jungle like this one should be able to support far more people. Although, I guess the survival rate could be low and many people migrated away. After 3k years they should have developed more agriculture at least. The astronauts should have left that knowledge."
241,Yeah something has to go wrong with the creation of the village no way 5 scientists wouldn't immediately write down everything they know and also all books and internet was still available so they could relatively easily collect all meaningful human knowledge as a database for the new civilization
242,"This seems like a large plot hole unless its explained later. They should have been able to teach their children how to keep basic infrastructure running. Within a few generations they should have had a small settlement around a power station and other basic utilities. There should have been enough computers and electronics to last many generations, and by then the descendents should have been able to run the factories and more advanced facilities to keep the important technology available."
243,Yeah there should be thousands of solar panels that they could use and if they planned their drop right could have landed near a dam for unlimited energy for hundreds of years
244,Tl;dr They are so distantly related that senku probably brings in more fresh DNA than anyone in that Village
245,defended from....
246,thats a lot of incest
247,It will get way more complex and marriage age will probably fall to puberty to get maximum numbers of kids. That's why humans can reproduce that young and why that's the rule with primitive groups.  But you do need to get the population up into the hundreds probably  to go all the way down in age as Mother Nature does not wait for individual living rate to reach 100 percent just hight enough that more babies are born with a higher mother death rate than number of babies born with lower older mother death rate.     Note pregnancy for Dogs and Cats also and I assume other mammals is extra risky if you let them breed as soon as they want to. Mother Nature cares nothing for the individual so that extra first pregnancy risk is one worth taking for the MOTHER. :P
248,It also would have taken only 2 new generations for the Gene's of the 6 to all be mixed into one Child and about 5 for everyone there to be sharing very similar Gene's so about 180 years of pure inbreeding. Nice
249,"I was actually fixing to do that math myself so thanks for saving me the trouble but also, i was curious, just how related would Senku be to say Kohaku or Ruri. You get 50% of your father's genes and 50% of your mother's, meaning your child will get 25% or of each of their genes from you and from the 50% of the genes from your partner would give you 25% of each of their parents as well. To keep it simple im going to assume that at least the priestesses' bloodline is a presumably direct link back to senku's father and lillian?.       For simplicity im not going to try and account for things like cousins or gene segment varriationsmutations through the generations as even siblings from the same two parents can have the possibility of getting a completely different set of genes from the same parents. I'll also not try to figure out for the possibilityinevitability of counsins, by any means, count as they could possibly hold a gene segment from an older relative that you dont have and raise the percentage back up to relatabilityshared genes of past ancestors. Imma just be using the straight up percentages of genes split up and passed down as though one line is direct to senku's father and the other is a new batch of genes. It'd also be further complicated as the astronauts are from international places as well and theirs' and their potiential offspring's dna would be relatively diverse in some way. I don't feel like making this more complicatedtime consuming that it surely will be.      So the first kid the two of them have would have half of their respective genes. Then when they have kids, itll be halved once more, so on and so on. Ill use the 185 generations you approximated out In only 25 gens, the percentage is down to 0.000149% of shared genes. By the 50th gen it's down to 4.44089e-12. By the 75th gen it's at 1.32349e-19%. The 100th gen: 3.9443e-27%. 125thgen: 1.17549e-34%. 150thgen: 3.50325e-42%. 175th gen: 1.04405e-49%. 185th generation rurikohaku would share 1.01958e-52% of their genes with senku.      If anyone wants to check my work, all i did was continuously divide by 2, starting with the 50% of the genes. I kept track of how many times i did this by making tally marks in my sketchbook while using my phone's calculator for the math."
250,Just FYI I did a bit of googling and the generally accepted norm for a generation is 25 years. So that'd be 148.6 generations.
251,I was interpreting that the generation gap would shrink though in a world without modern medicine.
252,The generational gap for the afformentioned study included that. It wasn't just modern.

262,"No, it was his adoptive father.    Strange they made them look alike even though they aren't technically related.    "
263,More like... x150-200 generation.     Any two living human beings right now in our universe are more closely related than humans separated by generations spanning 3700 years.
264,"I mean, by then Senku and Kohaku aren't even related anymore they're far too genetically distant from each other by 3000 years to even be related"
265,"Man, I'm glad Senku is just utterly uninterested in romance, stuff would get weird otherwise"
266,"Well, probably more like x120 great uncle"
269,I’m so nervous that is going to be the case. Are Senkuu and Kohaku about to become related?!    NOO WHAT ABOUT MY SHIP.
270,Maybe the ship is carrying some embryos for experimentation so that would explain why they had enough genetic diversity to not die off.    Embryos in space isn't a crazy concept. They could've been doing experimentation on generational space travel or something.
271,For some reason I’m really itching to spoil you but I’m not going to
272,No
273,Dr. Stone sunk this ship pretty hard lmao oh well
274,"No, they're not related."
275,They definitely are if the whole village are decendants of just 6 people. Just a matter of how much.

279,Isn't she a descendant of his father? She and Ruri look a lot like singer-chan
280,"But how many people are descendants of Genghis Khan? Would any even care if the hooked up with another of his descendant? Probably not, and that's only 800 years gap, compared to 3700 years in the show."
281,That's thousands of years of generation gap. No one is gonna care if your ancestor was the brother of your wife's ancestor in the time Jesus walked the earth.

285,"Nah even 3 generations apart is not considered incesr and will not cause complications because they're too far apart that it won't cause inbreeding, as the fucker who found out that Jolyne and Giorno having chidren wont cause inbreeding because they're generations are far apart said"

That's the way I visuallized Senku's before the anime since some manga covers have it like that, gray-ish and only a little at the end of the hair "
292,"Man, I love that image. All the little details, Kohaku awkward waving, Kinro, the chief and even frikin Magma lowering their heads. The way Kaseki is praying. It really outs into context how important the Last 6 are for them."
293,"IKR I haven't seen this image in a while and the first time I didn't pay much attention to it, but now that the anime chapter is out I feel the weight!"
294,"Glad to see the women for the most part have good hair styles for space. I have noticed on the ISS lately women's hair mostly likely to be styled right for Space. But especially earlier years of American Program I'm going Dorks you don't wear that style going into space it looks so stupid. Braid it, cut it short, wear a Afrothat will be a pain keeping trim but if effort willing to do it works good   Plus who ever had US crews in collared shirts without even collar stays was stupid. You want Space Crews to look cool so wear stuff that looks cool in space. Nothing to baggy. The Sci Fi fashions was actually developed with what was practical in space in mind after all. Thus no collars and fairly form fitting. You don't have to go Hollywood tight but just don't look to baggy like your slouching your time away."
295,When I see things like that I start wondering how many bits of bad animation I must've missed due to focusing on the subtitles.
296,"Art, not animation.    Now, if his hairline was scrunching back and forth as he spoke like an accordian? That'd be bad animation."
297,I know the difference. My point is that me having to look at the subs makes it easier to miss these kind of moments whether they be stills or weird frames.
298,"If you look closely through the episode, he consistently has this ""unfinished"" look.    Sorry to ruin it for you. ;"

303,"Yeah, it genuinely seems like somebody was supposed to fill that part in, and they just forgot."
304,"I do love how as a kid he had that ""delinquent"" voice that you see in anime a lot. I love it."

307,"Funny thing is even though he looks like he has good lean-muscle at first glance, thus making him look hunky as you say, he is still in actuality physically weak as hell and has poor stamina. Lol."

311,Can we talk about the lips on Dalia?
312,She reminds me of Satoro's mother from Erased
313,Yep

318,When combined it makes her look like a fish
319,"Well, fuck. Guess i can't ever unsee that now."
320,What do you mean?      Perfectly normal : smile
321,We can also talk that Dalia should be Daria. Changing r to l was unnecessary here.
322,"Last season we've got Dumbbell's Zina turned into Gina, now it's Daria into Dalia. Blame Hepburn for being a garbage romanization system.    Though, this one is more on the translator, since Daria is a perfectly recognizable English name."
323,"Ironically, she is Dalia in russian crunchyroll subtitles too. She is Darya in French and Italian subs though. Small fact about Zina - her name is considered ""old woman name"" nowadays, like Mildred in USA, and nobody names their daughters like that anymore. Most Zinas are about 60 years old.         Russian cyrillization system is not very good too, it is pretty similar to nihon-shiki romanization system, and most russian speaking people don't like it. So Ishigami Senku becomes Isigami.     So, as an example - names from Kaguya-sama - Kaguya Shinomiya becomes Kaguya Sinomiya, Shirogane becomes - Sirogane, Chika Fujiwara becomes Tika Fudziwara, and they study in Syutiin school."
324,"     I haven't watched Kaguya-sama, but this made me physically uncomfortable. Polivanov system of transliteration is a bad joke."
325,"If you think Hepburn is garbage, try any romaization system made for Korean, you'll understand what bad romanization looks like.      At least Hepburn can be used to pronounce Japanese words and is instinctive for Westerners, which is its purpose. The problem here comes from the fact that each time you translate something you risk losing information, not from Hepburn in particular. The mangaka names his character Daria but writes it with the Japanese script katakana here as ダリア. This transcription loses the distinction between the English r and l. So the information loss doesn't happen from katakana to Hepburn but from English to katakana. This implies that katakana is not suited for writing English, which comes as a surprise to no one  , even more if you know katakana and have watched Golden Time  . As you said in the last part of your comment, the real problem is the translator not noticing that ダリア sounds like the English name Daria.    Funnily enough, if the translator truly used Hepburn, this wouldn't have happened. ダリア would have been transcribed as Daria. So Dalia is a conscious choice made by the translator, probably so that the people reading the subs will stick closer to the Japanese pronunciation, which is questionable in this case."
326,"Nah, the VA distinctly pronounces Daria. It's just a preconception that ""the Japanese pronounce L as R"" that made the translator do that. Which I blame on Hepburn precisely because of the whole philosophy ""instead of using latin letters to spell Japanese phonemes, let's just replace those with the sorta-similar English phonems."" This becomes a problem precisely when you add a third language to the mix, the one that phonetically is way closer to Japanese than to English.    Going back to the Dumbbell example - the Russian Zi is spelled with ジ - a letter that is pronounced as something between ""dzi"" and ""zi,"" a very close Japanese equivalent. But Hepburn suddenly has it as ""ji"" for reasons related exclusively to the English pronounciation, not the Japanese one."
327,"Sure, but the translator didn't use Hepburn. Moreover to achieve streaming a translated version one hour after its release in Japan, services like Crunchyroll use the script to translate, and cannot always check it against what the VA are saying. I also never said that Japanese people pronunce the English R and L the same way, but that when writing the word in katakana, the distinction is lost. Finally, even if they used Hepburn and it failed at the task, you can't blame it on Hepburn itself, the system was made to transcribe Japanese words, not English or Russian words. The blame here is definitely on the translator, not the Hepburn system"

329,"Dalia and Yakov are both jewish names while Daria isnot, so I don't think it was unintentional"
330,Cues Daria meta ptsd.
331,Those are pretty standard Boichi female design.
332,If they were we wouldn't be talking about her lips.
333,She got those Tanya Degurechaff lips.
334,If you read boichis hentai that's pretty common. They are literally DSL's
335,tfw senku realizes his father is already dead
336," I mean, he probably already guessed, since he knew his dad would've been up in space at the time, and even if his dad was petrified in space he'd still have died since the ISS can't be run unmanned and would've fallen from orbit or been hit by space trash during the 3000 years."
337,"The ISS has to use booster to maintain its orbit every couple of weeks, so it would probably crash within months after losing fuel."
338,Theoretically they could raise their orbit as high as possible rather than using the fuel for station keeping. Would reduce the amount of drag by a lot.     For maximum safety they'd want to do that or crash it before they send the escape pod down anyways. Would be pretty shit to make it to the ground only for a chunk of the ISS to splat you 5 months later.
339,Yeah thats not going to hit you. All but guaranteed.
340,"Unless they turn out to be cursed by shonen gods, there is literally almost a 0% chance of the ISS landing on them."
341,however Starman and Musk's Tesla would still be doing just fine
342,4.5 years
343,maybe there was hope that he was in space... petrified
344," I mean, I guess, but if that was the case Senku would probably die before he could rebuild society enough to fetch him."
345,"there was still hope, though"
346,"No biggy, just glue all that vaporized dust back together."
347,Senku didn't so much realize his dad is already dead so much as he realized that his dad lived.
348,"Damn, those father and son scenes really resonated with me.      I would absolutely watch a slice of life about the science adventures of Byakuya and Senku"
349,I am in too both dad and son are quite cool
350,This anime is doing its damn job making me want to read the manga
351,Since you are more than halfway the anime. Try to finish it. Then read the manga from the beggining. The art byitself is worth the read
352,That’s what I usually try to do but every episode leaves off on such a good note that it’s getting harder and harder to wait
353,"I agreed, esp with this episode. The urge to read the manga is getting stronger and stronger."
354,If the anime ends off on the chapter I’m thinking it will that urge us only going to get greater.
355,"Yeah, that's what I'm doing too. I read a chapter after an episode is finished so I'll be ready to dive in immediately after the anime is finished."
356,Is the anime really gonna end at 26 episodes?
357,24
358,Damn
359,The anime trumps the manga with an epic sound track that moves me every time I hear it. So enjoy it pure and raw so you can get a greater impact.
360,"I completely gave up last week after the name drop, fomo bought a bunch of volumes to read this part and beyond. The art on it is absolutely sensational."
361,"I just want to echo the others in this thread, wait if you can! I read the manga before the anime was announced and most episodes I get a feeling of ""man, I'm kind of jealous of the anime-only watchers."""
362,i already gave in after episode two i believe. couldnt take the wait. now I cant take waiting for the manga :
363,I went for it ages ago. No ragrets
364,"So basically the village is Senku's dad and Lillian?    I'm also curious to know about the other two pairs, when they're the last humans to exist, it's fair to assume they also founded their own villages Yakov and Dalia, Connie and Shamil.    Would be very interesting to see Senku meet their descendants, though it's unfortunate that we'll probably never see Byakuyan and Lillian again as they died of old age already    Would be funny to see Senkuu x Kohaku, considering he's her step-brother? step-uncle?    Also who's Byakuyan's VA? And does anybody know what happened to Senku's mother? She was never mentioned"
365,"I mean I assumed that all of the people on the ISS founded that village together. It's been like 3,000 years since then, so Kohaku is like, almost 200 generations away from Senku. Even with 6 people, the eventual inbreeding would be kinda weird for that village... maybe that's why some of their eyes are spaced weird lol"
366,What's weird to me is that in 3000 years they still count so little. How many people are in the village? 50?    That's way too little
367,"There's a lot of other weird things, like how the village has existed under the same name for 3000 years but is still just comprised of wooden huts, or why they pass their information on through something as unreliable as oral traditions rather than some form of writing system, or why they all speak Japanese when 56th of their presumably founding members would most likely have spoken English to each other.        Perhaps there was some major event that somehow prevented any technological advancements to pass on through the village, we'll probably find out next episode."
368,There's also the thing that they have never mentioned the petrified humans? I'm sure they know of it
369,Iirc one of them did joke about stone people waking up in the episode when suika was scouting for people to assist in furnace blowing.
370,"Yes, they mentioned the stone people like it'd be crazy if they were real people. Maybe something happened with that in the past. Remember when Senku came and they talked about the only outsiders being ones they kicked out? Maybe something happened and a civil dispute broke out."
371,"It makes sense to place conserving spoken Japanese on a relatively high priority if you're counting on a revival down the line, which Byakuya believed would come, after all it's the local language.     As for oral tradition over writing, writing requires a lot of materials and educational resources that could be spent on more vital activities, and humans have kept oral traditions alive for thousands of years. It's also possible that the stories started out written but eventually got lost somehow writing knowledge lost, original records destroyed, etc..    But yes, keeping 100 stories around for nearly four milennia is unrealistic. Also there should be more settlements than just this one."
372,"Well, since the next episode has already aired we've actually already gotten some answers already.        For the point about Japanese language,  ""it wasn't actually the local language at first, since the original settlement wasn't in Japan, but since Byakuya specifically created the village to assist his son in restoring human civilization, it makes sense he would teach them Senku's native language even though Senku probably speaks fluent English.""        And for oral tradition and the general lack of technology,  ""We now know that the reason to use the stories was that they were created to be ""fun"" so they'd be easier to pass on to the children, and since all the adults either died or got lost, there wasn't anyone around to teach them about writing or other technologies. That raises the question of how a bunch of children managed to survive, let alone prosper and make it to Japan, but at least it explains the lack of technical and cultural advancement.""        And yes, there should be more settlements, and  ""considering two of the original scientists didn't die on screen but got merely lost at sea, it's fairly likely that they survived and there is at least one more settlement they founded elsewhere."""
373,"Wait, the original settlement wasn’t in Japan?"
374," ""I don't think it's ever specifically said where the original settlements is, but I assume Byakuya knew, and the first of the 100 Tales is instructing the villagers to head to Japan."""
375,"Wait, but I’m pretty sure in  they traced the origin of the pétrification to South America, and decided to land near to its antipode... Japan. Or if not... at least in the manga"
376," ""They did aim for that general area, but they also missed it by a large but otherwise unspecified margin. It's a safe guess that the original island was relatively close to Japan since they had to make it there with primitive methods, but it could just as well be an island off the coast of Korea andor in the Yellow Sea."""
377,"Seriously. After 3,000 years, if each woman has an average of 2.5 kids there should be millions of them lol"
378,"And without modern medicine, soooooo many of those kids are dead shortly after birth, and then even more after a few years"
379,"Yeah, but non-advanced civilizations make up for that by everyone having like 6 kids. It's not like the population   wasn't   growing before modern medicine."
380,"True, it was growing, but with a seed size of 6 people, it's gonna take exponentially longer."
381,"Which is why females started having kids as early as possible roughly 12 and had to have 16 on average in the time of Peter the Great. With women always pregnant or nursing and ""woman"" work taking 8 plus hours a day, risk of women being stolen by other tribes and the fact that a tribe could afford to have men die in battle not breeding females you can tell why even in Earths only current  Matriarchy women stayed closer to home.  Peter's second wife and 12 children 2 lived to adulthood. King of Frances wife had 16 children 4 lived to adulthood in that time."
382,"considering the genetic variation of 6 people, they probably had more offspring dying than usual"
383,"It's a world without modern medicine, so I guess they die a lot. They also banish people for breaking the rules."
384,"theres only 6 people worth of genetic variation, a lot more offspring probably died off."
385,"Another explanation is touched on in the source material VERY big events along the way... Was it necessary to link to a comment I made just for this in the SM corner, does this not work, or was it not necessary?"
386,The weird spacing is just an side effect of their massive brains expanding the skull
387,Galaxy brains
388,     That's exactly what I was thinking 
389,"All the ISS, I think. Chrome has the same hair colour as the fangirl, the old man has a similar facial structure to the Russian man, Ginro's eyes are similar to the serious one, etc."
390,That is unless senkus dad found a way to petrify himself so he can meet his son again.
391,"Now that would be awesome     ""Hey I am gonna turn myself into a statue, tell my son who got the last surname as me and has greenwhite hair when he shows up! See ya losers"""
392,Then they promptly break his statue and throw the pieces in the ocean
393,Jojo part 6 stone ocean
394,So he figured out how to petrify people but not returning them to normal ?
395,"The people of the village share some of the genetic traits of the other astronauts though. Mainly brown hair, different eye color, and I think one of them has those lips like dalia"
396,"Looking at the character designs it seems clear to me that everyone in that village is descended from those 6, there's one girl that's an absolute spitting image of Connie if Connie looked super deformed, and Shamil looks like Ginrou but channeling pure Kinrou energy. Not to mention Kohaku's family looks like Lillian, though I can't help but notice that the only people we've seen with white hair are Jasper and Kaseki and Kaseki is old, so I'm wondering if Byakuya even reproduced at all."
397,"     I think it's safe to assume Ruri and Kohaku are his descendants, With Diva"
398,"Well obviously. Byakuya is a true man and a total stud, there is no way he didn't bang and knock up Lillian Weinberg, especially when they're both single and two of the last six humans. ESPECIALLY since they are BOTH the whole damn package: Talented, charming, smart, great people with kind hearts, and extremely hot. They'd have to be insane to not hook up with each other.    Also they clearly are written as having amazing chemistry together personality-wise, so yeah."
399,Is byakuya really single though? They've never said anything about Senku's mom
400,"If he wasn't single, he is now. Obviously. Since everyone down on earth was petrified. Same with any boyfriend or hubby Lillian may have had.    Given that Senku's mom never seems to be in the picture though, and Lillian isn't like ""oh no my husbandbf!"" when they see the petrification light down on Earth, it is safe to say they were almost definitely both single to begin with. All Byakuya screamed was ""SENKUUU!"" with no mention of any woman.    Like if either of them   loved someone   back on Earth, they would have been freaking out about that person's safety like Byakuya did about Senku, right?"
401,"Yea, they probably had the good ole ""Died from an ilness at a young age"""
402,"If they're pragmatic enough, they'd try to have every possible MF combination in the crew have offspring to maximize genetic diversity."
403,"Dude I highly doubt that the married couple is gonna let all the others bang their spouses. Lol. And I also highly doubt that Lillian or Connie would just be okay with becoming like, breeding-mares for all three men. Lmao.   Pragmatic or not, humans still have emotions,   so you can't expect people to just accept the idea of becoming breeding-machines for the sake of the future, that's insane."
404,"Chrome has the same hair color as the pigtails astronaut, though that could be a coincidence."
405,"     uh no, not fair, why is  that  the assumption you're going with instead of the one where all 6 of them made up this one village? we see people with Dalia and Connie's traits in the villagelips, brown hair."
408,Maybe they'll show about his mother as this anime is really working in details
409,I think his VA is Kishou Taniyama
410,For real though. What am I supposed to do now about my Senkuu and Kohaku ship...    God I hope this isn’t the case.
411,Dude they are 3000 + years removed. He is less related to her than she to Chrome.
412,"Don't worry, back in the day the incest was rampaging    And it's not even that close of a relationship"
413,"""Not even that close,"" dude as the person above you said, they are so many generations removed that they are practically as unrelated to each other genetically as any two random people from different families on modern 21st century Earth."
414,you do realize most modern humans are related too right?
415,"I assume they all founded the village together, all of them have SOME resemblances to some of the current people in the village"
416,"     It would just be uncle ""half-uncle"", but that's just uncle, and it would be like 350+ times removed...so yeah..."
417,"Shamil looks a LOT like Magma, and like Ruri'sKohaku's dad. Just saying."
418,"The VA for Byakuya is Keiji Fujiwara. He is also the VA for Maes Huges from FMA and Shiro Fujimoto from blue exorcist, all of these are amazing dads."
419,Everytime he opens his mouth I can only think of Leorio...
420,Leorio with Ging's face
421,He learned how to become a great father by doing the opposite of Ging.
422, that's  who I was thinking of! I knew I recognized his voice from somewhere lol
423,Also Leorio from HxH and my boy Kimura from hajime no ippo
424,Is he also Leorio from Hunter X Hunter?
425,"His voice just reminds me of lots of great wholesome anime deadbeats, like the pervert from Kawai no Minnasou. Though the only one I could remember for certain with that VA was Zenzo Hattori from Gintama, who isn't a deadbeat, he just reads Jump a lot."
426,"No wonder I found his voice familiar, it was the hemorrhoids ninja lol"
427,"     He's also Nohara Hiroshi from Crayon Shin-chan, which would be his most notable dad role in Japan. In fact, I have a feeling that they just give him all the other dad roles cause of his Shin-chan fame."
428,He reminds me of my drunk dad
430,"Huh, so that's why I couldn't help hearing Eugen from Granblue Fantasy in him. Same voice actor."
431,Hughes...    :
432,"He also made for a great ""Daddy"" for the three former-Yakuza members he had tured into idols in ""Back-street Girls"""
433,"Man, i'm shipping this so fucking hard next episode."
434,"""Hey girl, time to repopulate the earth with me!""   "
435,Senku father must be feeling the luckiest man of Earth for becoming an Astronaut.
436,Senku unintentionally helped his father hook up with a hot singer.
437,Senku unintentionally helping his dad to get his probably love   gorilla   interest into this world
438,That's some 4D chess play
440,Now that sounds like one of them old school anime titles.
441,"Nonsense, Senku has already found love, love in    SCIENCE   !"
442,"Senku unintentionally helped his father survive an apocalyptic event. But yeah, hooking up with a hot singer is definitely better."
443,If you think about it the whole reason the earth is saved is because of senku. If senku didn't get his dad into space then he wouldn't have survived and that would mean that senku's dad would have never convinced the other astronauts to come back to earth therefore creating the village that senku needs to survive as well as the hints his dad gives him through the 100 tales.
444,Behold the power of Science.
445,Nah it was all part of the plan. Senku knew what he was doing 10billion percent.
446,"She's the lucky one, Senku's dad is hot."
447,"""Ara ara!""   &nbsp;  &nbsp; "
448,        
449,Let's be the Adam and Eve of this stone world   
450,For scientific of course.
451,"Well, they're technically already on a ship there"
452,This one’s floating though . We need it to sail !
453,"I mean, for us humans, technically, you can think of space as water, we can't breath in either if we are completely exposed in it...But yea, no, I get it."
454,"If you think of the Solar Panels as Solar Sails, it could be considered sailing! Albeit it's contributing 0% thrust due to the craft circling back around to receive solar rays on the other side."
455,why have a ship merely sail when it could soar?
456,If they ship Kohaku would be a cousin of Senku?
457,An  extremely  distant niece or something yes.
458,Don't think the vocabulary for familiar relations was made to handle these kind of cases.
459,"At a certain point, it's easier to just say ""ancestor"". I don't know where the cut off between counting and just saying ""ancestor"", but I think after 3700 years, its pretty safe."
460,"She's Senkuu's half-niece 148-times removed, assuming generations of 25 years or so."
461,"After THAT many generations, it definetly doesn't matter.      But you can bet they will make a joke on that one."
462,No. Her DNA would be so changed he wouldn't even be related to her that much anymore. It would be like a stranger really.
464,"Your spoiler is broken and visible. Interesting if true, though."
465,"Please fix your spoiler, it just shows the text anyway :"
466,I'm sorry.
467,"no worries, just pointing it out for others :"
468,DILFs also needs some love
469,But that would mean that Kohaku is related to Senkuu. NOOO. I ship them so hard :
470,"They are very distant in terms of genetic relatedness, given it’s been so many generations since the founders of the village. It doesn’t matter much at this point, so you can still ship Kohaku and Senku"
471,"Fair point. I guess I wish they just chose a different route. Like why even make this an issue? Especially when I had so many ideas for how this new civilization was started, I did not expect it was by 6 people having kids and then making a semi-incest civilization assuming their offsprings ended up having relationships with each other, which is necessary for the civilization to have stayed alive all this time."
472,"I see your point, and it definitely is a controversial way to do it given how incest is taboo in our society. I'm not too hung up on it though as I said it's not that much of a deal anymore, and I'm just focusing on the good science in the show haha. Still 10 billion percent ship them :"
473,Senku's true love is science-chan.
474,"For now yes, and in the end we get to ship whatever we want and are entitled to have different opinions :"
475,"She's probably going to end up with Chrome imo    Edit: Jesus, calm down guys. I was basing it off of when Kohaku asked chrome if he would ever marry her. Don't you think that sounds a little foreshadowing? Yeesh."
476,NANI?!? Chrome love Ruri...
477,True but I was thinking back to the episode where Kohaku tells him she'd be his wife
478,"Yeah, that shit made me so mad! I was like “Noooo! You belong to Senkuu” lol!    Doubt they will become a couple."
479,"I honestly thought the same thing though. I WANT Kohaku and Senku together so bad but I think they're not going to give him a romantic interestscience is his lady. Then again, who would that leave Ruri with?"
480,"Definitely Chrome for Ruri. They have made it seem like he has a crush on her, and Ruri May have a crush on him as well!    Yeah, Senkuu does love science lol! Hopefully by the end of the series he will like Kohaku."
481,"Heh, space shipping"
482,Its pretty obvious considering the character designs.
483,Rofl right? Who the fuck thinks this  isn't  happening?
484,She is thicc. Good genes for starting the whole civilization.
485,"Christ, those eyes look so fucking dumb. They look like two different species between the left and the right lmao"
486,is this your first anime?
487,"No, and a very small percentage of anime are gonna have eye width that wide. They exist, yeah, and I'll call them goofy every time."
488,"The problem is with the adaptation. Boichi can draw very well and a lot of the women he draws in his R18 works do not have this problem; even in the manga for this, the problem isn't there. For whatever reason, the animation studio exaggerated the spacing on the women's eyes."
489,Boichi's style does not translate well to animation.
490,Kohaku and Ruri look awfully similar to Lillian... Coincidence or not? 
491,her hair is behaving way to well. Hair like that goes every direction in space and I have seen it on the ISS if not quite that long lose hair looks horrible in space.     Will fan wank she has that hair stiffened in some special way so it does not go 360 from her head.
492,Do we know if Senku's dad is single or still married to his mom?
494,"I expected to hear a Japanese song or an engurishi songu from a blonde American anime girl, but it was actually an English song with an excellent native accent. This anime is taking everything too seriously."
495,"well if you have japanese va speak all those scientific things, an excellent english accent song wouldn't hurt"
496,Who was the singer though? I feel I heard her already and was probably from Disney.
497,"I saw this in the credits, I assume that must be the singer for the English song?    "
498,Yes it is. The katakana above spells Lilian Weinberg.
499,I knew the singer was a musical theater singer. Her voice sounded like it belonged on Broadway.
500,
501,And she isn't even American..   Wtf
502,"It gave me a Disney singer vibe too honestly. Lol. Not in a bad way, she had a very nice voice. Even if it felt a bit awkward, it carried pretty well."
504,it sounds like Idina Menzel voice of Elsa in Frozen kinda but I don't think it's her.
506,Absolutely not...
507,"The song did sound a bit off, but I don't know whether that was a bit of Japanese vowel elision coming through, or just the singer trying to fit a translated song which is likely to be particularly wordy into the melody that they had."
508,The pronunciation was pretty solid. The lyrics were just very weird. It was a bunch of cheesy idioms back to back with no rhythm to hold them together.
509,"I notice it happens a lot with Japanese produced english songs, the smash ultimate theme, the astral chain theme.            They're not bad but you can definitely tell that it's Japanese"
510,"Have you heard the English versions of Radwimps' songs, like from Your Name? They really suffer from this problem, despite the fact that the singer is fluent in English. I think the problem might be trying to keep the lyrics close to the original - it preserves the thoughts better but sounds awkward. It would probably sound more natural if the lyrics were entirely rewritten, just trying to preserve the theme and message of the song instead of getting every line to match the Japanese."
511,Radwimps' english songs have awkward lyrics even when they were first made in english.
512,probably because they think in japanese with japanese mindsetculturebackground.     ;    its pretty similar problem with literal translation vs localization
513,"Ah, the classic issue that fan-made english cover singers have; to keep the original lyrics or Adjust them because it won't sound right"
514,"One problem is that, if the song is written in Japanese, there isn't necessarily a word-for-word or even non-grammatical-particle for non-grammatical-particle translation, so short Japanese phrases end up expanding into long English expressions, and it becomes a challenge to fit these long expressions properly into the melody.  Song translation either needs to make sacrifices in the melody, or sacrifices in the accuracy of the translation.  When the melody has already been written, the former is difficult to impossible so the latter is necessary, but choosing what to sacrifice is difficult.    It's easier if the translator is a native English speaker, because they will be aware to an extent of what properties aren't important in English.  For example, a native Japanese speaker might see it as important to distinguish, say, the perfect and preterite forms i.e. was done vs. did - I don't actually know whether this particular distinction is important in Japanese though which, in English, are technically distinct but the distinction is often ignored.  The perfect is wordier than the preterite in English, so you can see how repeated choices of accuracy over significance can inflate the translation."
515,"Also, lyrics in Japanese and English songs are very very differently written. So translating a song written in Japanese, even if the translation is really well done, will still sound weird, because songs just don't have lyrics like that in English or in the West I guess"
516,Sounds like a musical. But not a musical.
517,"just mash some words together and you got yourself a song, baby!"
518,"Okay beck is a masterpiece tho so I give it a pass. I actually learned how to play Moon on the water, it's a really nice song."
519,"All of Seira Kagami's anime songs have amazing, spot-on English pronunciation, and are quite good to boot, but man, the lyrics are so bad."
520,bruh. Smash ultimate theme is a straight bop
521,Its good but dont tell me the lyrics changed your life lol
522,Well no but hardly any song does. That said I really enjoy the lyrics
523,"Iirc, rhyming isn't as necessary a thing in Japanese music, so it makes sense that they wouldn't think to do it for this song. It's a bit of a shame as it hurts the authenticity just as bad Engrish would."
524,"You seem to be confusing rhyming and rhythm. I can guarantee you even ""classic"" Japanese music has rhythm and Japanese musicians understand that rhythm is incredibly important."
525,"But I wrote ""rhyming""...      Edit:   Oh, you wrote rhythm. I was adding to your comment that the lack of rhyming also hurt the song, since it's a big element in English songs."
526,"The singer was Laura Pitt-Pulford according to the credits, but I gotta say when you look at a lot of Japanese songs and translate them to English they tend to be pretty cheesy 80's90's stuff."
527,I was expecting some quality Engrish once she started but I didn’t notice until the end. That VA either practiced those lines a lot or she’s a pretty fluent English speaker.
528,Sang by Laura Pitt-Pulford 
529,"Sounded super Disney-esque and familiar, I’ll be amazed if that was a Japanese person’s voice!"
531,Haven't seen a single anime lately doing what you said. Every anime has had an acrual english song. I love Dr. STONE but this is nothing to brag about.
532,wish they captioned it still though. us hard of hearing fans need to go track down the lyrics on a third party sight to know what was said and really appreciate it.
533,"Something sounded off, like the pronunciation of 'start', but could be nothing"
534,The moment you realize you will actually have to bang each other to repopulate humanity like a in a bad pornhentai.
535,W-will they do orgies? Just for academic purposes...
536,For genetic diversity
537,They did studies and found out that you would need at least 98 people to raise a new population without the risk of genetic disorders though...     So there is still space for 92 people
538,I mean look at Mantle.  Its fair to say genetic disorders are in order.
539,"I mean, have you seen Kohaku's eyes?"
540,"plus the ""fuzzy vision"" being a big enough problem to have it's own term, some really weird differences in height, and Ruri almost dying from what seemed to be a relatively mild disease i'm not a doctor don't kill me."
541,Pneumonia isn't a mild disease at all. If you don't catch it or can't treat it then that person is very likely dead.
542,It depends. Walking Pneumonia is a form of pneumonia just much more mild but usually goes away without medical care.
543,This. Had pneumonia when  12 years old. Would absolutely be dead without modern medicine.
544,          Mate prior to antibiotics people died from fucking common cold.
545,"Untreated pneumonia can absolutely be deadly, though. 4 million deaths per year worldwide according to wikipedia.          That is  with  antibiotics available."
546,"Not like, at the same time"
547,A little genetic disorder keeps things fun and interesting.     I'd opt for orgies.
548,     Nothing wrong with some gamble for humanity's sake.      
549,"If they mix their semen, they get more genetic diversity right?"
550,That's not how reproduction works really
551,"I'm certain it is, my wife's boyfriend wouldn't lie to me"
552,Can confirm. I am the boyfriend.
553,"Can confirm, am girlfriend"
554,incestual orgies confirmed canon by the mangaka
555,Looks like someone likes incest hentai
556,He's just so candid about it
557,"He also has a point. When there's so few people left you really don't have the luxury of going ""ew incest"" if the goal is to repopulate. Hell, even without population problems, royal families practiced this shit all the time in order to keep the bloodline pure."
558,"Of course, yea. He ain't wrong.         It's at times like these that I like to link this"
559,"I mean yea sure but there is a genetic problem when it comes to fucking your relatives. I like how the author says “who cares about incest, we need to survive!” But ignores the fact that incest does cause some biological and genetic problems to which he responds “dOnT tAkE it TOo liTErAllY!”"
560,"The second point was more about having an acceptable break from reality for the sake of decent storytelling. While Dr. Stone does have accurate science, keep in mind a lot of it still works on anime magic."
561,"i mean the village is tiny after 3000 years, clearly the problem with incest is accounted for since there had to be far more offspring dying off to make the tiny village make sense.    and incest isnt 100% guaranteed problematic, it just has a higher chance than non incestual relations. you can potentially have two siblings be completely unrelated genetically."
562,     MY MAN
563,Thank god it was three men and three women. Can you imagine if poor Lillian had been the only woman up there? Oof.
564,"Kind of cynically, the best ratio is probably to have  more  women than men. But three and three keeps it wholesome two are already married too."
565,as wholesome as realizing-they-still-should-still-be-swapping-partners can get at least.
566,I'm surprised the village has the institution of marriage at all and isn't just a polyamory commune on the example of the founders.
567,"RIP 3,000 years of village elders clamping down."
568,at least they are split evenly and no one will feel left behind lol    imagine if they were 7 and one dude was left jacking off to the side because the other 6 already split to couples
569,"For the sake of genetics, they'd probably need one lady to be impregnated by any odd man out too. You need as much diversity as possible and it's not a situation where you can really be picky. Given they're astronauts, it's not like there's any real scum in the bunch anyway."
570,I can totally see the blond dude go psycho and NTR everyone else.
571,that dude is obviously kinro and ginro's great great grand zaddy
572,For the human race! For Science! Banging with a noble purpose
573,"To be fair, one is a married couple and the other already has some romantic flames going. It's that last pair that has some issues to work through."
574,I will mention the two with long unbraided hair would not look good like that. Ive seen hair like that on the ISS and it goes every direction and looks horrible. I'm like style your hair for space before you go dork you want to recruit future kids and looking horrible not a good start.
575,  The moment you realize you will actually have to bang each other to repopulate humanity      I am actually kinda horny to see some hentai involving this kind of plot
576,"Damn, as someone who works at NASA, I'm impressed with how much detail they got right. Don't see that level of detail often in any kind of media. Can't wait for the next episode."
577,"This show seems to have a real affinity for finer details, theres a few things that time wise dont quite match to how it would in real life but fundamentally hit the nail on the head. I'd absolutely love to see a chemical engineer or whatever sit down and just talk about what the show does right and wrong because it would be a fun way to learn even more about the neat science going on in this show"
578,"From what I've seen other people say, the show is more or less precise on everything and the only ""creative liberties"" taken are regarding to how efficient those things are. So the chemical reactions are real, but kinda harder to obtain, the machiens do work but aren't quite that efficient, etc.     ;    IMO that's as good as this type of show can get and I love it for it."
579,"Right, without industrial machinery, not only are the efficiencies probably much lower, but the purity possible from using the techniques that senku use are probably not good enough to actually manufacture something as complex as a sulfa drug.     But that's where the suspension of disbelief comes in."
580,Unless the show is going to pull some last minute twist in revealing that Senku is actually some advanced piece of industrial machinery and the whole Mecha-Senku thing wasn't just a gag.
581,"I wouldn't be surprised if Senku turned out to be a cyborg created with all of humanity's scientific knowledge, maybe for archival purposes.    A civilization human or otherwise with the technology to petrify a whole species should be able to create something like that."
582,eh cyborgs being turned to stone? what kinda cyborg would be made that had a fault like getting killed by a sharp hit to the neck? perhaps this wasn't to be taken seriously but I had to point these out for my own sake.
583,"Ya, as a CHME student the only thing I’ve noticed is how clean all of Senku’s chemical reactions are. I can’t even get stuff like that in a lab environment and he’s over here doing it with bamboo and shit. But also I understand why it’s written like that, and love the pacing so here we are."
584,Also high schoolers can punch a lion to death and power a dynamo with crankshafts.
585,"Sacrifices have to be made for storytelling, I'm surprised how little they are. For example, repopulating with 6 people would be... well. Impossible. But then again, it gives us things to talk about and to learn, so that's great."
586,"To be fair, it's not like they actually succeeded in re-populating the earth. 3000 years later they've got one village, and there's what, like... 50 people in it? Doesn't sound too unreasonable."
587,"The miracle is that there's even a village at all. There's a term called ""minimum viable population"" for a species to not go extinct. Scientists estimate at least 50-500 humans would be needed no AdamEve last 2 humans are able to repopulate the Earth. For the offspring of just 6 individuals to have survived past the first few generations is a miracle in of itself."
588,"That's false, it's only for healthy repopulation, you can repopulate with 2 people."
589,"Nah, minimum viable population MVP is the   of individuals that is needed to make it very unlikely that the population goes extinct. Ofc this definition is based off of probability, meaning there is no guarantee that if the population      As in with just 2 people, or even 6, it's a  miracle  that the village still exists. Ofc it's  possible  to repopulate with 2 people, but only if all the stars in heaven aligned just right which it evidently did in Dr. Stone"
590,"This is not considering intervention. Considering the founders are all astronauts, their chances of surviving an event that would kill off a wild or ""dumb"" population is much greater."
591,"True, but with a gene pool down to the single digits, genetic diversity becomes the bigger issue. AFAIK, the 50500 rule was specifically just to address the inbreeding issue."
592,50500 is very out of date. A MVP has to be calculated for each species. I saw one link here stating 98 humans needed but possible range of 80-160.
593,"Which is fine, still more than a magnitude of difference vs 6.    Tbh I'm more bewildered by the fact that Ishigami village still only has like 30 residents after 3700 years. Sure 6  can  repopulate the Earth if the stars aligned, but a population of  30 across almost 4000 years? They were a stiff breeze from going extinct at any point in time."
594,"also remember that other people might have awakened during the 3000 years, Senku might not be the only one that got drifted into a lucky place, just the most successful  important one which is why he becomes the MC.       But the village having some kind of no outsiders rule makes it a bit more complicated again"
596,"To me the greatest creative liberty is that everything works out the first time. I made a generator similar to what Senku did but only got it right in my third or fourth attempt, and I knew exactly how to do it, it's just that you make silly mistakes or a step is harder than you realize"
597,"Ehh, a lot of things don't work at the first try. Senku literally said it in-universe a few episodes ago."
598,     I haven't read the Manga but apparently it's even more accurate than the Anime. Afaik they are intentionally being vague about some of the details to avoid kids trying to copy some of the more dangerous stuff.
599,"I'm a Chemical Engineering student. The physics and reactions are all correct. The way Senku obtains some reactives is the same way they would have been obtained centuries ago. The only issue though, is the fact that some parts are somewhat exaggerated. You can, for example produce a drug doing the same reaction that he uses, but it is likely you would have an end product with an awful purity, and a really bad yield. Still very good, because without those things the series would become boring very quickly."
600,So he could have done it but needed a lot more time or a more welcoming village for more manpower.     Good part is I would expect a first use of Penicillin reaction from things used on when maximum effect of the drug was achieved before the microbes adjusted.
601,"That's not the only problem. He doesn't have a really accurate way of measuring things, and his reactives don't really have a good purity. That's the reason why I say it's exaggerated. But you are mostly correct."
602,I'm surprised no youtuber has done it yet.
603,So basically like that Doctor that did the watch series for Cells at Work.
604,"Chemical engineer here! I lost countless hours trying to understand all the reactions in the manga last year. Like, not even joking, all those tiny details that seemed rushed in the previous episode about how the sulfa-drug was made were accurate as fuck. There are about 10 reaction steps hidden in that one scene and they were all there, detailed. I have about 5 pages worth of diagrams so far just to understand this show. It's phenomenal how they managed to keep it interesting for everyone and yet give us science nerds gold nuggets like that to explore ."
605,I'd be very interested if the author had a degree in these fields because as someone who knows nothing about it its incredibly believable and honestly I get kinda giddy when I find out how legit these methods actually are. This show really is such a contender for AOTY personally
606,"Fun Fact: Boichi, the illustrator of Dr. Stone, majored in Physics in college. Also, they have a science consultant."
607,"Obviously there are liberties and exaggerations to make the series more fitting for a shonen, but they have scientist consultants to help with those details."
608,Thanks I have been arguing they actually are using consultants on this don't assume author is full on stupid and lazy. But yes dramatic license has been used.
609,They actually do credit the person helping them in manga chapters.
610,"It tries to get detail down to about as far as they can legally go before the editors tell them ""no we are gonna get sued or some shit""    I think occasionally its dead wrong but for the most part it tries to be extremely accurate as the grey zone allows it to be"
611,I'm really curious about how long some of the chemical processes would actually take.
612,"Apparently in the manga volumes, the author actually has citations for his sources, which is absolutely going above and beyond"
613,Thats pretty cool.      What do you do at NASA?       meguminthumbsup
614,"I work with one of the mission design branches and design or validate trajectories, mainly for work involving Artemis our program to return people to the moon.  It's really fun :"
615,Wow thats awesome.      Well good job keeping the gang safe to and from!       brofist
616,So what you're saying is you're a professional Kerbal Space Program player. Except I guess you cheaters just use MechJeb all the time.
617,"Pretty much hah, although KSP can't even model some of the crazy 4-body trajectories that I need to make."
618,So was the accurate part where they were lining up to dock the space ship?
619,"That part was accurate, yeah. They were wearing the right space suits, got the interior of the Soyuz right, and even reproduced camera footage from the alignment instrument"
620,Damn that's quite amazing.
621,The limits of patched conics. Can’t even predict Lagrange points.
622,"Even the NASA-developed software that I use professionally has issues finding the most optimal solutions on the 4-body problems which depend on spacecraft, earth, sun, and moon gravity. More complex than just lagrange points. It loves getting stuck in areas that it thinks are mathematically optimal when they're still far off. Which is both a headache and a fun challenge when working these trajectory problems."
623,"I’d like to know more about these algorithms, sounds fun! I work at the other end of the size scale - programs to simulate atoms & electrons, mainly."
624,Username checks out.
625,kid Senku would absolutely love talking to you!    you are literally fighting for the kingdom of science
626,So do you know how difficult would be to then to come back to earth on their own ?
627,"The space station itself is controlled from the ground, so if something happened to mission control, things would start going south after too long.    Soyuz can be controlled by the astronauts, so I definitely think they could return to the Earth by themselves if they had to."
628,"Cool, do next episode could be them calculating their re-entry ?"
629,Its such a waste of money going back to the moon... Go to Mars or bust. Moon is hella boring.
630,That’s really cool. SLS is still pretty shit though.
631,"You won't be saying that when SLS is sending people to the moon, Orion is streaming 4k views from lunar orbit, and HLS is sending back pictures from the rim of a giant dimly lit crater on the south pole.     No other launch vehicle comes even close to it in performance, which is why it has to be expendable. The stage drops off in way too high of an orbit to make recovery feasible. Plus it's massive. I toured where they're building it, and I can't even describe how huge the tanks are. It was an impressive sight. It made even the Delta IVs I saw in ULA's factory look like toys.     It would be more impressive if they provided funding to launch it more often--the current plan doesn't nearly use it to its full potential. But maybe that'll change when it starts flying and the public starts realizing how cool it really is."
632,"Yeah, it will be a great rocket when it's finished. It's just a shame how many problems there have been in development, and now it looks like the first launch that had been hoped to happen in 2020 even this year has been pushed back to 2021. Congress needs to give y'all more money and fix the horrible patronage system that spreads out your facilities all around the country. It'll be awesome when we land on the Moon again, but 2024 seems like an Elon-level optimistic timeline. Kinda seems like Jim Bridenstine is just saying that to make Trump think we'll make it back to the Moon within his theoretically possible Presidency."
633,"Yeah I've known it was likely going to slip to 2021 for a while. Boeing really screwed the pooch. At least they got all their shit resolved, and we can finally move on.    I agree 2024 is way too optimistic. Not as batshit crazy as Elon timelines, but still outside reality. There's too much uncertainty with HLS, which, they haven't even awarded contracts yet so there isn't even a design. And the push to launch HLS on commercial rockets rather than SLS is making it needlessly complicated they had to split it in 3, and two of the 3 parts will be tough to keep small enough for Falcon Heavy. And then the launch windows and transfer trajectories which I worked a bit on that are required to keep mass at a level that Falcon Heavy can handle are a nightmare"
634,Defeat aliens
635,By clapping their cheeks.
636,Captain Kirk?
637,NASA = XCOM
638, Space Force 
639,"Thats a military branch, but hey you can still sign up!"
640,EDF! EDF!
641,They watch anime to learn about science
642,"Oh sweet I might actually be qualified to work at NASA then, where do I sign up?"
643,WorkatNASAwatchingAnime.com
644,Trying to understand orbital mechanics with Kerbal Space program s
645,"As long as you aren't doing weird 3-body or 4-body trajectories which my job unfortunately actually involves some of, KSP is actually a pretty good learning tool lol"
646,Save the world
647,Clean up orbiting space junk.
648,Planning for a repopulation project should a major extinction event happen on Earth
649,keep aliens jailed on area 51
650,Is there a protocol for Astronauts if something like this happens? I mean.... repopulating earth
651,"There most likely is a protocoll for some kind of ""no help is coming"" scenario: suicide.    Everything below a 100 hundred people would result in the end of our species due to inbreeding. There are currently 6 humans in space.    source for the 100 hundred people: "
653," That fact always astonishes me honestly, like, even today cheetahs get pretty much bodied by every other predator in the savanna, to the point that their cubs have a mortality rate of 70%, yet they're still here, trucking along. At least until a disease finally kills them all off in one go because they're so genetically similar, but that's another issue."
654,Eventually they will all probably die but as far as inbreeding goes you can get quite a long ways despite inbreeding.     Extinction due to inbreeding defects literally comes down to pure stupid luck. Either you will last Millennia or you will die off in a couple of decades.
655,"     I don't think the article states that. It states:         Those astronaut's goal is not to set up a healthy population, their goal is to not go extinct. Inbreeding defects are affected by natural selection, they will be removed by natural selection once the population is high enough.     The thing that breaks my suspension of disbelieve more is that some of the villagers still resemble the astronauts after 3k years. In the effort reduce inbreeding you'd mix you partners up as much as possible I'd assume, which will result in the loss of those characteristics.    I can believe that they passed on the 100 tales for 3k years, because stuff like that happened in human history before, but it's hard to believe that there are neither offspring villages and nor inbreeding depression. If the population of the village were high enough, a group of renegades could just leave and start their own village, but if the population is to low the 98 from your article, you get problems with inbreeding. I don't think the village has that many people. It's really hard to believe there is just one village with  30 ppl after 3k years."
656,Imma just cut and paste from my reply above.                               
657,"     LK is an event that affects most but not all of the population, I suppose? If I remember my classes right."
658,I wonder if any of this could possibly come up later in the series........
659,"Fun fact: We possibly came close once way back when and lost all weird kinds of hair and eye colors in the process. Well, amongst more serious things than anime hair and eyes.    "
660,All anime is set in an alternate reality in which that bottleneck didn't happen.
661,"Setting ethics aside, they could use frozen reproductive material that people have saved in a worse case scenario."
662,I hadn't even considered it. It's likely some buildings still function. All you need is a turkey baster and somewhat relaxed attitude on the subject.....
663,That number for the minimum amount of people needed for a healthy genetic defects free population.
664,"Have you looked at people with issues due to inbreeding? We are not talking about people that are unhealthy.... ofcause, the more people you have, the later things start to get realy serious,"
665,"     That makes more sense if they also can't go back to Earth - no fuel and stuck in orbit or on an escape trajectory. In this case they can undock the Soyuz and try a re-entry without external assistance. It's one in a million, but even if they couldn't realistically repopulate, at least they would get to live out the rest of their lives if so they desire."
666,"Yeah I a seriously wondering how the hell they're getting down on their own. Unless they can somehow contact NASAESAJAXA computers to have their return course plotted, it's pretty damn hard to do that with what they have available. And Japan isn't exactly a normal landing site."
667,"I'm surprised nobody answered this! In the episode, they mention still being able to reach the internet from their laptops. That's because the laptops on the ISS can remote desktop into servers on the ground, and those have an internet connection.    So yeah, it's probably possible."
668,"For the manga, Boichi the manga's artist apparently used over 1,000 reference photos for the space-related chapters that are adapted in both this and the upcoming episode. My father works as an engineer at NASA as well, and I'm interested in showing him some of this stuff to see his take on it."
669,Not surprised. I found the manga incredibly detailed on these chapters and couldn't wait to see the adaptation. I'm glad they stretched it to 2 episodes instead of cramming it into one
670,"Chiming back in to say I'd recommend the Byakuya reboot manga that just started if you're not already on it. There's mountains of intense detail in it. It's only two chapters in, and I doubt they'll be in space for very many chapters, but even just these two chapters alone are insane."
671,What details do you mean?
672,What really made me anxious was them ripping open these food things       You dont want Miso Soup to fly around in the ISS uncontrolled if not necessary
673,What? Everyone knows that floating soup and incredibly sensitive billion dollar equipment go together like Senku and science.
674,"Accurate Soyuz, accurately drawn space station, the interior of the station looks mostly right, the clothes they're wearing are representative of what an astronaut would wear, the food packets they're using are drawn rightused right though really they'd eat soup with a straw rather than rip it open, though astronauts are known to play with blobs of liquid lol, etc."
675,"Their movement in zero-g was a bit odd, but that would be tricky to animate 100% correctly and not look weird."
676,"I know that whenever people go the ISS, it's a rule that there should be at least one American, one Russian and then a person from another nationality. If you look back to the rocket launch you can see the respective flag patches on their shoulders."
677,"I'm surprised Amateur Radio got a shoutout when they were trying to contact anyone back on Earth.    That's right, ISS astronauts do talk to the general public from up there. "
678,"Talking about JAXA, and especially cooperation with Russia in space really made me think of Space Brothers. You should watch it if you haven't, though given your background and that you watch anime I imagine it's a given you've seen it."
679,Really reminded me on the anime Space Brothers in some scenes
680,I'm glad scrolling through the thread I'm not the only one! Really gave me the itch to rewatch that show.
681,"Then, you should watch Space Brothers, it's even more accurate."
682,Watch Space Brothers.
683,"Have you seen space brothers? If so, how does that compare?"
684,"I own the full bluray set but haven't gotten that far into it yet. But skimming through it, it looks like they got a lot of details right on stuff like the space suitsflight suits, the training aircraft, and heck, they even accurately drew the guard checkpoint at the Johnson Space Center lol. I was surprised when I saw that."
685,I used to have a friend that worked at NASA and he absolutely loved Space Brothers so.. Take that as you will. Lol.
686,"If you want to see detail in space, watch Planetes. It's insane how detailed it is."
687,"I'm watching that one right now and loving it. Kinda disappointed that they got a few details in the intro wrong like showing a Gemini when the text is describing mercury, and showing Sputnik 1 when describing Sputnik 2, but overall that also nailed a lot of the details."
688,"The details they got right are mostly the mechanics of being in space. Things like conservation of momentum and sound among other things. As for showing the wrong missions while describing others, you could give them some slack couldn't you? :P"
689,"I just think it's funny that they had accurate details on the missions, and just fumbled on the pictures which, were still drawn 100% accurately hah"
690,"It's weird what mistakes they'll make, right? Especially after painstakingly animating everything and everyone to preserve momentum."
691,Have you seen Space Brothers?
692,"The astronaut stuff really made me want to rewatch Space Brothers, highly recommend that one to anyone in the thread that got a hankering for some more anime astronauts."
693,Yep except for hair behavior. Ive seen what the hair on the blonds does on the ISS it's not pretty. Glad I have only seen works in space hair lately but I not following that close.
694,Right? They actually showed counter-reactions from movement in zero G. Although they also kinda fudged the hair for narrative purposes. Lillian's locks should have been everywhere. Mostly in the equipment.
695,"They did get a lot right. On the other hand, they got a few things wrong too. The biggest thing that stood out to me was how huge they made the ISS appear on the inside. In reality it's a lot more cramped.    For example, the Cupola isn't a giant window in the middle of a large hallway; it's a small module off in a corner next to the toilets. :P"
696,The weebs have infiltrated NASA
697,One of my coworkers sometimes even wears an anime lanyard to hold his badge lol
699,Yeah except everyone speaks perfect Japanese
700,"They probably all speak english on ISS even in Dr. Stone, though for the sake of anime, japanese audience and avoiding terrible engrish, you have to imagine it yourself, happens all the time in every anime.      As for the village, my theory is that they landed in Japan and decided to teach their kids japanese since they probably figured out, people inside stone are not dead and eventually they'll break out."
701,"can you ask the nasa twitter to tweet a short clip of it? and mention JAXA twitter? and the manga author's twitter?    i think it will make the manga author pretty happy and NASA's tweet probably will fall into ""fair use"", so no copyright fiasco"
702,Except that aboard the ISS they seem way too far away from Earth.
703,"Random question, would the ladies have been allowed to have so much unrestrained hair while floating around? Wouldn't that be a major fire hazard if a stray strand of hair got in between the electronics somehow?"
704,"Sometimes they'll tie it back if they're worried it'll get in the way of an experiment, but I've seen plenty of pictures and video where it's floating all over the place.    Majority of stray objects get sucked into the air filter vents. Like if the astronauts ever misplace a small object, that's one of the best places to look first."
705,Pics or rthathappened
706,"I'm the CEO of NASA, and yes, he does work here"
707,"But my dad is the CEO of Nasa. Is that you dad? Please come home already, it's been seven years."
708,"Seven year olds shouldn't be on reddit, son."
709,Lol liar
710,"Tens of thousands of people work at NASA, we're not exactly unicorns and I'm not the only one who posts on here "
711,"Okay, this is pretty cool, I could definitely just watch this group going back to Earth and dealing with what they find for the rest of the show since it is a different situation than Senku's. Also some fun personalities there."
712,They actually just announced yesterday that Byakuya is getting his own spinoff manga.
713,"Aww, that actualy makes me sad because it means we most likely won't see a lot of it here..."
714,Dont worry every chapter with Byakuya in it is good
715,Top 5 best dads in anime.
716,"If Byakuya claims to be number 5, nobody else would dare claim the first 4 spots"
717,"That name gets its turn in the limelight after Bleach attached it to someone who frankly was a bit of a shit brother, at least at the beginning."
718,Gendo would dare.
719,Not much competition tbh when most of the parents in anime embody this image.
720,"I'd put Kiritsugu from Fate on that list. Grisha Jaeger, too - his second try."
721,"Out of interest, are you reading the AoT manga?"
722,I am. He actually is pretty admirable and benevolent in his later part of life.
723,Grisha is a different case a VERY different case.
724,"      ""Grisha is a rare case of anime dad who got fucked over by a terrible son."""
725,Truly beautiful
726,"idk, a lot of shonen heros tend to have super sweet moms, though they also generally die prematurely. Dads, I can't even think of that many. If they have any noticeable character, they're either dead like the one in We Can't Learn or adventurers like Ging Freecs."
727,Van Hohenheim.
728,"Kinda on the ""wandering adventurer"" side, though for good reason and still loved his children a lot."
729,"Technically on the normal side of absentee fathers due to ""work""."
730,Bigg Bro-ther?
731,Bondrewd is best anime dad.
732,       FTFY
733,I’m fine with that. I’m watching dr stone for Senku and the gang. I want to see what’s next for them. Now I get to checkin on his father whenever I want
734,Given how popular the main series is I would nt be surprised if this gets an adaptation in a few years
735,"hOLY SHIT I didn't even hear about that, awesome!"
736,This is 10 billion percent awesome news!
737,So essentially Last Man on Earth?
738,"FUCK YES!    Kind of reminds me of ""The 100"", but I bet this will be 1 billion percent better."
739,Seriously? This just took a sudden turn for the awesome.
740,Do i hear movies?
741,Probably not. Spinoffs of Jump stuff rarely get anime.
742,A man can only dream I suppose.
743,Boichi is a madman. Is Inagaki writing that one too?
744,"No, Boichi is writing and drawing it."
745,Really? Do you per chance have a link?
746,From the Dr. Stone subreddit.
747,Thanks a lot!
748,What's that? A comic which will probably have a ton more Lillian too? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP!
749,Waitwaitwait what!?    Give me proof.
751,Hooooooooooooooly shit.
753,"How the fuck is that a spoil? It's just a spinoff manga announcement. It has a literal 3.7k year gap between them, how would it even count as a spoiler?"
754,chill bro
755,How in any definition is that a spoiler
756,"You could interpret that as meaning that Byakuya doesn't get any more focus in the main series, but I never said that."
757,Even that isn't a spoiler since its very fucking obvious that he DIED like 3700 years ago lmaooo
758,"I was gonna say this,     SPOILERS guy who died thousands of years in past dosent get a ton of focus in the series, shocker."
759,Ten billion percent no spoiler
760,"Yeah, they could totally make a spin-off series about that group."
761,Can't wait for the repopulation chapters
762,you pay extra for those.
763,It's happening.
764,Are you serious?
765,"Yep. It was announced this week, and will be called Dr Stone Reboot it's not a reboot of the series though"
766,Probably reboot in the sense of restarting civilization :3
767,That's awesome!
768,The character of his father is rather really cool
769,I know right this could definitely be its own show lol
770,"It will likely be its own show in a couple of years, they just announced the spin-off manga centered on the astronauts."
771,Maybe in 3 years once they’re completing the anime adaptation we’ll get an OVA of his upcoming mini series
772,"Considering how much repopulation they have to do, it probably wouldn't be suitable for TV."
773,I would too but I’m betting it would be a very different type of series. More primitive survival than the rebuilding society series we have now.
774,"Im just here thinking, 6 astrounats were the first generation. And the village they have DOES NOT HAVE TECHNOLOGY, in 3000 years they advanced NOTHING, like WTF"
775,6 people have to repopulate the earth?           SWEET HOME ALABAMA HAS ENTERED THE CHAT  
776,That explains why the girls eyes are so far apart
777,Lmao I was thinking the same thing
778,What about Yuzuriha then?
779,She just had a very special family wreath
780,rCrusaderKings approves
781,WOWWWWWW
782, How their genes look.
783,Honestly that was my first thought as soon as she showed up.
784,Hmm must maybe Studio Deens animation is effected by genetics after all.
785,One option is that they could go to a sperm bank before the power shuts off to increase genetic diversity.
786,"Robbing a sperm bank isn't a thing you hear so often. Overcome, adapt, improvise."
787,Small brain: Robbing a bank for money.    Big brain: Robbing a sperm bank for genes.
789,overcum
790,"Right, i forgotten that this could be an option esp since electricity is still running and most infrastructure are still usable, so this isnt starting from scratch.     and this way they get the number of ""people"" needed to prevent inbreeding defects too."
791,"Sure, but even then they’d be half siblings.    What they would need to do is find an IVF facility so that they could have surrogate children. Means a huge burden on the women though."
792,I doubt they'd complain too much when the alternative is the potential extinction of humanity though.
793,Do people really have an obligation to a species?  If 99.99999% of humanity is already dead then what's the point?
794,"idk somebody has to make cat videos, right?"
795,"If it was up to me I'd just say, ""You know humanity had a good run.  Good luck to the next intelligent species.""  It's not like people are in the habit of reviving dead civilizations.    The caveat here though is that those petrified humans weren't actually dead so perhaps the astronauts believed that was the case and would be motivated by saving billions of people who are still alive instead of just being motivated by saving ""humanity"" as a concept."
796,"There wouldnt be a next, sadly. There's a plethora of reasons, ranging from simply time left on earth to no more easily accessible ressources and weird stuff like space trash."
797,Byayaku I don't know how to spell it did say he wanted to save all 7 billion people. Maybe he couldn't figure out how so he set the village up for now.
798,I mean the only reason Asshole helped Senku is to get a cola.
799,"Uh kind of, yes. It's the single most fundamental driving force of life; to reproduce and continue existing.    Humans can be awkward at times because as self-aware creatures we often make decisions against our instincts but in a crisis situation that's not usually the case.    Besides, we're talking about astronauts - the pinnacle of human achievement. People who grew up with the results of human civilisation and who were able to stand tall atop it. They would be the most sentimental people possible for such a thing.    Think of it like this:    If most of humanity is gone, and nobody reproduces, humanity will go extinct.    If humanity goes extinct, all of its millions of years of achievements are forever lost. Moreover, there is no guarantee that there will ever be other life capable of appreciating much less continuing the legacy left behind.    Thus, we should keep humanity going. To do otherwise would be an insult to everything we've ever achieved personally or as a species. And for creatures that love to ascribe meaning to everything, that can be a pretty big deal."
800,Reproduction  should  be the most important driving force and yet birth rates continue to fall below replacement in Western countries as people make choices to put their careers or life styles ahead of that.    Even for those that are actively prioritizing reproduction what are they actually prioritizing?  Most would say think they are prioritizing themselves by having children to preserve their own legacy.   Perhaps some people are prioritizing preservation of their family line.  As you go more and more general you start getting into more and more abstract identities.   I just have a hard time seeing obligation to a species being a thing.    Suppose for example it was discovered that the sun will go supernova in 10 years destroying the solar system.  A plan is devised to save humanity by sending a few dozen frozen human embryos to a habitable world 5000 years away.  These embryos have to be genetically engineered from scratch for the journey and won't be directly related to anyone.  The frozen embryos would be thawed out and raised by robot AI which are the only other things that can survive thousands of years.  The world and everyone on it dies but humanity as a concept will survive in some distant corner of the galaxy.     Is there  really  a point to all that?  Who really cares what happens if everyone is dead either way?
801,"Currently Western Civilization has fallen to a fantasy that it wanted for Marriage and the Taboo instinct is even causing people to create false history to insist marriages ages always this high even though I play Bridge with Old ladies two of which married at 16, one at 15 and most right out of high school or right after Collage if they went there.     I got a well researched Prize winning book on Peter the Great which shows 12 was normal age for girls to be married up until the late 1700's and you can see that by very low age of consents lasting into the 2000's. A marriage scandal for a singer in the 50's marrying at 13 was only possible because 13 was fine a hundred years before. Why so young and applies to the Village. When life expectancy is high 20's to low 30's and up to 75 percent of children die before adulthood you have to start very young to get enough babies. In Peter the Great's Time average woman had to have 16 children to keep population stable they got close but not there and population shrank in that century.     A woman starts with all the eggs she will ever have.   Every year from puberty a female waits more eggs are damaged or destroyed by radiation and oxidation. Which is why there is a Term Old Maid in that a woman is too old to marry to have the ton of kids needed. In Japan 25 is still considered the cut off and genetically and chance of pregnancy wise that a good idea. Look at how the chance of genetic disorders clime every year from puberty.     And I hate following conclusion but before modern views people were expected to have children and as late as the 50's a man faced difficulty being promoted if single without kids.   But every person has to have 2.1 children for humanity to exist. And unfortunately making having children voluntary is a failure and the poor birth rate even effects the super rich so it's not a economic problem. Luckily it's a very overpopulated world and the poorer country birthrates still way to high. But as they develop we will have to start expecting everyone to have children again in some sort of system. We don't have to go back to the old fashioned system though there are many alternatives. IF we can get STD's under control the standard village orgy every night appeals to me with child development a group thing and that is the lifestyle humans best designed to until civilization.     Radical Moderate by politics I am."
802,what the hell did I just read
803,Modern problems require modern solutions.
804,"Real question here, are all live human cells including sperm and eggs petrified or just whole humans?"
805,"We have 3 couples it seems so, whilst genetic diversity certainly won't be the best, they should mostly be okay.    From what we've seen earlier though, it looks like quite a significant amount of the village has eyesight issues despite being fairly young so that could be the trade-off."
806,     This in the end.     wow
807,Suddenly Kohaku's eye spacing is just a mutation from all the incest.
808,"Considering her ancestor has it as well, I don't think that's the issue. Though Lillian is American, so maybe she's from Alabama...?"
809,"It’s taught me one thing, this show has. Humanity could be held in stasis for thousands of years and Alabama would still find a way."
810,"That’s why they sing Sweet Home Alabama, because you always come back. Just not on the back."
811,And we would all fuck it.
812,"The manga does mention she has a southern accent, so Alabama is on the table"
813,"My god, the author leaned into the memes"
815,Omg lol
816,"     Turns out the whole ""everyone turns into stone and a few people have to repopulate the Earth"" thing happens more often than you'd think."
817," Unless they find survivors on the surface I really doubt that 6 people would be enough for 3000 years. At the very least, all of them being from different countries means there's a large amount of initial diversity, and if none of them have any major genetic disorders that'll help. But 6 people is just too small an amount when the lowest estimated MVP for humans is 98, with the assumption for that number being within a risk-free environment where disease can be treated.    Even before considering the risk of genetic disease you have to consider the risk of accidental injury and death. If any good size potion of their fledgling population dies for some reason it could easily result in the death of their entire group."
818,"Building off of this, due to the rigorous selection process, astronauts tend to be some of the most physically fit and intelligent individuals Earth has to offer."
819,"Imma put out a theory.    An LK-class restructuring event just happened on Earth, and 6 people were left untouched in orbit.    Assuming that they landed in Japan, the nuclear reactors will still function for 2 years. Which means electricity. Not to mention wind turbines and such.    They copulate and also undergo IVF to ensure genetic diversity until the tech breaks down. At this point everyone knows that it's impossible to maintain the current tech level, so they salvaged what they could for as long as they can, and write down what's left of humanity's knowledge and culture to their descendants to remember their legacy.    Somehow humanity got lucky, and they manage to survive.     Ishigami village is not the only human settlement in the world, as we can see that the former village chief does not let outsiders enter. At some point in time, some left to start their own villages. At least, that's what I think."
820,Remember that the former chief knew of people from outside apart from Senku and it isn't Tsukasa.
821,"I mean, they kicked out criminals so you know for a fact the ones wondering out there already joined Tsukasa's clan."
822,Nah. It isn't that hard
823,I mean we also have a high school student who can kill a lion with one punch so actual realism beyond the basics of the science projects left us long ago.
824,"My problem bigger than genetic diversity is how few people there are. In order to have this few people after 3,000 years the birth rate has to be only just barely above 2."
825, Blame that on the environment's carry weight. The village doesn't farm not like the land could support it anyway and Japan doesn't have enough wildlife to support a large hunter-gather society. It doesn't matter if they can pump out enough kids to theoretically reach thousands if there'd never be enough food for that many people in the first place.
826,     They grow their own watermelons. There was a scene where Magma was harvesting them.         It does.
827," Right, the watermelons. Regardless, they also have some strange obsession with remaining within the bounds of their village considering that they never expanded beyond the two plateaus, so I suppose their pop. limit could be self imposed"
828,Just do like 10+ kids per person and you solve the problem early on.
829,"Plugging in the population calculator on      After plugging in the numbers for 6 people, and cutting the growth rate in half, 3,000 years we should see a human population into the millions."
830," That calculator outright states that it doesn't take into account any factors that negatively affect growth, so it's totally useless."
831,"I tried it with a growth rate of .005, or 0.5% world growth rate is at 1.2% .012       Don't know if I could go any lower.  Even at extinction levels of growth of 0.002, there should be 2,000 people after 3000 years      However if it were only 500 years, the output at 0.5% gets you about over 100 people. Which would totally been cool if other people woken up from their stone slumber among various decades here and there.      But man, 3,000 years of humans getting it on, even with 6 people, there should be a hefty sized population."
832," That's also assuming that there was in-fact constant growth, it's very likely that there were some years were not every available woman got pregnant, or even some years were no-one got pregnant. We even see this as I don't think a single person in the village is pregnant right now.      The calculator also just doesn't take into account the carry weight of the environment for a population. The simple fact is that as a hunter-gatherer society in a geographically shitty place like Japan there just isn't enough food to support a population more than what we see in the village."
833,"Japan had plenty of population in actual hunter-gatherer times. Certainly more than a couple hundred people. The only thing restricting their population is that for whatever reason they haven't spread out much, so they're working with the resources of a tiny corner of the land."
834,Correct for the village but there should be hundreds if not thousands of villages scattered around.   We have not been told this the only village or humans yet.
835,If they can get to them before the power grid fails they could go to a fertility clinic. That would help some.
836,Also gives us a reason to say the bug-eyed female designs are intentional lmao
837,"Well, 3 men and 3 women can make 9 different couples. If you the  mix up the next generations maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Plus, they're from all over the world, so they should be fairly diverse, genetically speaking."
838,     But would they go THAT far?
839,"If you're in charge of repopulating the Earth, you better go as far as you fucking have to"
840,Maybe we'll see how that part went but I expect something more romantic.
841,"Oh, you mean in the show. Yea, no way they'll go the orgy route. Was just thinking in general."
842,and also the village population is tiny after 3000 years
843,They are not all related... But they their children will eventually be lol.
844,"It's estimated that around 150 people are needed to have a healthy gene population. So by eventually, that means pretty much 1 generation in."
845,Roll Tide!
846,More like Buckingham Palace
847,"Yo dawg, heard you like listening to music"
848,When you got an expensive pair of headphones but also want to look cool with the airbuds.
849,Flex on the haters.
850,I mean golden retrievers playing basketball are pretty cool
851,Always thought that was just some kind of hair ornament.
852,I'm convinced those are part of her skull. They even lasted the entire 3700 years still on her head while she was petrified.
853,"Yeah, wtf are they?"
854,Pretty sure it's a headband and not headphones.
855,How would that turn to stone and come back though
856,"iirc it didn't even turn, it was still on her head not stoned when Senku and Taiju found her and just didn't degrade, SOMEHOW."
857,How would the people
858,"Just like how the clothes didn't turn to stone along side the people, that's why it wouldn't have turn to stone and come back if it is some type of headband"
859,"Oh right, for some reason that completely slipped my mind."
860,It's probably a protrusion on her skull
861,She even had a tiny version when she was younger in a flashback.
862,Elfen lied confirmed??
863,Digging deep for them old ass memes
864,I see exactly where Senku gets his curiosity and thinking from. Byakuya for best dad?
865,"Father and son the ending makes 10 billion times more sense now    It was really great how this focused more on the relation and emotions between Senku and his Father, becasue the basic premise has been done to death, as soon as he said he wanted to be an astronaut it was obvious he would avoid the petrifaction in SPACE.    But that right away then explains why Senku was so focused on making space rockets etc, HE wanted to send his father to space. We already knew that Dad was the best father of the year selling his car as he believed in his son and wanted to motive his son, and while Senku always acts like eh does not care about people etcbut still got the sweet spot e.g cola last episode he was actively trying to send his father to space.     ;    Now his Father is Clearly gonna smash     ;    I hope its gonna be more humans do, like say Senku got 2 younger brothers who 1 stayed in this village and across the mountain the other one made another evil village and so on.    THE space craft is for sure gonna crash down so I bet Ruri knows about a secret holy place with old space tech stuff that Senku can use."
866,I doubt 3000 old tech is of any use other than being toys for kids.
867,this 3000 old tech is GODLIKE tech as its from our time if it still working that is a Dai news for senku
868,"Damn, I expected Senku's father to be the founder of the village, but I really didn't expect the village to be that old! I guess that throws out of the way the possibility for other settlements to exist in this world."
869,I have a feeling there are settlements outside of that village. Remember a few episodes that they said they can banish people and never let them back.
870,"Yes of course, but what I mean is about other settlements that were created apart from the village."
871,"Banished people from Ishigami village are my first guess if there are other settlements.     For my second guess, I posted my comment here and something bothered me. Were those 6 people the only ones in space? There should be other countries with their own man-handled space stations right? And if there are they can do the same decision as Byakuya's and return to Earth and repopulate too."
872,I am pretty sure this is accurate though. there really aren't people hanging around in space for extended periods of time outside of the ISS. A quick google says the ISS usually has between 3-6 people on it at a time.
873,"     I mean, if it is like in real life then no. For the looks of it and the names of the crew members, it seems that they were on the ISS, as one of the crew members said that she was from NASA and when that cataclysm happened they all tried to contact all the agencies."
874,"They explicitely say ""welcome to ISS"" and earlier on approach and it does look like the ISS, so..."
875,Well my second guess was wrong. Which is probably a good thing so it won't overcomplicate the story.
876,"It's the Russian Soyuz carrying people from all the space agencies to the ISS. It's this world's ISS, and therefore no one else is spending any significant orbit time other than the crew of the ISS."
877,Isn't China trying to put up their own?
878,Yeah but it's not built yet.
879,"The ISS is the biggest space station out there and keeping people in space is expensive and kinda dumb when you can just send them to the ISS unless you are planning on doing something military related. Also, Dr stone happens just a few years into the future I think 2020? so the space situation shouldn't be very different. To finish, Russia is again IIRC the only country with enough space lift to send manned missions, so there probably isn't many people going into space if it isn't for the ISS."
880,     China is planning to put up their own space station with the core part of the station going into orbit in 2020.    So I guess it depends on  when  in 2020 the story takes place.
881,"     2019 actually    We know the exact date Taiju woke up 5 Oct 5738 Senku said he woke up 6 months earlier, we don't know the exact date but I just put it on exactly 6 months earlier we also know the exact seconds he counted to when he woke up so I used some random time calculator and got this date."
882,"     In the manga, in the very first chapter, we see Donald Trump being petrified, so it's either before the election, or Inagaki-sensei gives him a fair chance of re-election."
883,"The only functional and inhabited space station is the ISS and it's shared between the 5 major players in space USA, Russia, Europe, Japan, China. Hence the name  International  Space Station. There are plans to have more, but that's decades out. And we rarely ever send humans out to space if not for the ISS space shuttles got killed in 2011, so everyone just uses the Soyuz as transport."
884,This could happen in the future. Remember that we only know what happened in Japan.There may be a mad-max society elsewhere.
885,I think if there was another station Byakuya would have probably thought of that and not prematurely referred to themselves as the last six humans.
886,What about people deep underground?
887,     Nope. The only manned space station in operation is the ISS which is used by various countries. So there wouldn't be any other people in space except for those in the ISS. China is trying to build their own but construction hasn't happened yet.
888,Dibs the blonde dude got banished first and his successor thousands  years later joined Tsukasa.
889,Ahhh. Right. They must get randos walking in occasionally. Otherwise they're like really too chill with Senku showing up.
890,"Their technological progress isn't so great. 3000 years passed, but they're still in stone age. That's strange. Humanity was petrified, but technology left untouched."
891,"They're astronauts. Just getting back to Earth and establishing a community and system of governance is a huge task. Also technology will work just fine for the first few decades but will inevitably break down.    Probably one or two generations in, all technology and food stores would be completely exhausted and a community of scavengers would need to learn how to survive and produce on their own.    3700 years is a tiny blip in the timeline of civilization. It took much more than that for the nomadic wanderers to establish self sufficient dynasties. This group of survivors has an extremely limited work force. Any of the 3 women getting pregnant reduces your efficiency by 17% for about a year and puts a pull on everyone's resources.    That such a small village would last for 3700 years is the more unbelievable detail."
892,"Ya gotta remember Senku is a literal genius. He would probably be able to single-handedly get humanity back to industrial revolution level, it’s unlikely any of the astronauts had that level of breadth. Probably more in depth knowledge, but would the doctor likely know the exact way to produce sulfa drug from scratch using 20th century methods? Probably not."
893,"Even if they had the knowledge, that doesn't mean they'd have the resources. Remember, the first thing senku really did with the village was make ramen so he could trade it for labor, the astronauts didn't have that luxury."
894,     Depends. If they knew the compound required their chemistry training could easily kick in. Not to mention they'd have books and possibly electronic references to fill in the blanks.     My guess is the village entered a dark age at some point after the founders died off.
895,"Yeah, that's the strange part. As they didn't get petrified, one could expect that they at least tried to preserve some of the old technology inside a cave or something? Plus keep using it to keep things like that are currently are on modern times, as even if the resources like gasoline are limited because no one is producing anything, they will have basically an unlimited supply for such a small group. And that's not even mentioning that all of them are scientists, so preserving the old knowledge would have been a priority for them."
896,"And in the very least, things like cattle and agriculture. For some reason Ishigami Village has neither, but a basic food supply should have been one of the single most important things to build as soon as possible. I'll grant that Japan doesn't have a lot of farmland but plant agriculture in the very least should have stayed - and assuming it takes them only a few days to get back to Earth, there should be plenty of printers, ink, etc for them to print off any information they don't know from the internet while it still works.    I know it's a 3000 year period, so even if they did things can easily get lost, but something must go really, really long for  agriculture  to disappear."
897,"Yeah, I would suspect that other catastrophe happened to the village during that 3000 years period. As it is really strange that they don't have cattle or rice or knowledge from the past that has not been trasformed into legends and mythology."
898,Given we're in Japan presumably. catastrophe is definitely possible. Particularly earthquakes.
899,And that there's only like a few dozen people.
900,"The thing about farming is that... it isn't easy. you need a huge amount of manpower to handle the process. there is a reason it took humans so long to go from hunter-gatherers to settled farmers.    Why spend so much time farming when you can easily spend much less time fishing or hunting or looking for food, which yields better results and most importantly, yields them now.    Even right now in the story there are about 60 -70 people in the village, not enough to sustain a farming community."
901,"I know it's not easy, but even something really, really small-scale would be better than nothing. I grow my own fruit, I am fully aware of how little you get for the work you put in - but that doesn't mean I can easily believe a fundamental cornerstone of civilisation would be completely and utterly abandoned to the point that the very concept is alien.    It wouldn't even have been too big of a deal in the first couple of years, given the sheer amount of preserved foods lying around and now-vacant properties that can be utilised for farming, preserving, etc.    It seems that the number of technologies that survived into Ishigami village can be counted on one hand; rope bridges, pointy sticks, fire, and wine."
902,"How much fruit do you grow on your own? is enough to sustain your daily needs or would you need to go gather buy from market extra supplies? how much do your fruit last vs how much it takes you to grow them? and so on.    Then again, you're assuming they landed in a fertile place suited for agriculture, but as we see Ishigami village is situated on a series of cliffs, with no suitable agricultural lands to be seen.    even if they started farming from the first generation, next generations will eventually think of it as a waste of time considering the amount of resources you need to grow up food for a large amount of people. You need:    - A reliable water source for water    - suitable land    - many people      now remember, there isn't a large group of people there. there are only 6 survivors, 3 of them are women who will be out of service during pregnancy, they will need people to take care of the children etc...    Point is, at such a small scale, farming isn't worth it."
903,"Depending on the amount of plants you have, their age, and how well you take care of them, and what type, of course, you can probably yield enough for between one and seven meals. It's certainly inefficient but all the same I doubt that agriculture started on a massive scale.    Animal farming at least has other benefits that remain constant at least in the case of Truffle-searching pigs or milkable mammals. IN the case of cows, goats, bison, etc, you can turn the milk into cheese, which keeps for a long time and is an excellent storage food.         That is very true and I'll admit that being set in Japan really does hurt the idea, since Japan has absolutely awful geography for it."
904,"Was there a point for cattle an agriculture though?    Early there were plenty of food around, and some of them could last years canned food. Lack of such amount of humans was better for nature longterm. Nature could heal thanks to lack of civilization fish colonies greatly increased, same with wildlife and plants. Why waste so much time creating something as such as agriculture when you had nature around that you could just use. Animal hunting, fishing, gathering fruits, etc.  There weren't many of them so ecosystem didn't noticed humans influence.    Agriculture takes A LOT of time, all of them and their kids even this wouldn't be enough would need to basically spent majority of time to invest into that and still there is no guarantee that they would pull that off. Lack of preparats to prevent insects and weeds they could have them at beginning but they could just run out of them would greatly dimnish successful harvest. Them not having personal experience with agriculture before should be also taken into account. Animal hunting, fishing and fruit gathering are better option, not only they do not requre that much manpower, they would also take less time. Agriculture is longterm  investment and requires resources be it seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, time and manpower .     It also seems that Byakuya put a faith in Senku who would advance future generation technologically since Senku was all around sciencist while those who arewere in space had advanced but much more narrowed knowledge. There were 2 Doctors but they probably wouldn't be able to produce any non-natural medicals because they probably weren't chemists.      By the way, they didn't seem to have problem with food anyway. There was this fatty kid who complained that he needs to eat fish again. Magna easily hunted some Deer ? and ate it together with his lackey during night before    or after he ""killed"" magician."
905,"     May just be the numbers. I was reading  Guns, Germs and Steel  the other day and there's a story of a Pacific islander population that literally lost agriculture and simply reverted to hunting and gathering upon migrating to a certain island - the Moriori. It simply happened that the crops they brought along didn't grow well in the climate of the new island, they didn't have more good domestication candidates, and in general it wasn't economic for them to keep it up, so they simply regressed.    Remember that there's a theory that early agriculture was  worse  than hunting gathering in terms of both work needed and quality of food produced. The only strong point is the much higher density of food production, but that's not something a tiny village with so much untamed land around would care about."
906,     I can absolutely believe that considering the time and effort it takes to get a single vegetable or fruit. I can only imagine how much worse it would have been before the crops were specially bred.
907,"It's more shocking that they didn't try to preserve books and literacy. You have all the knowledge of humanity up to that point stored in books, you would think that saving that and building up using that knowledge would be fundamental."
908,"Yeah I'll agree to that. Books don't last long and making paper is definitely too complex with a tiny society but then we used to write on parchment made of animal hides. Or earlier than that, carve it into stone and many stone-carved writings are still readable thousands of years later if not eroded."
909,"To be fair, all it takes is one broken link and all that goes out the window. One generation's chief thinks reading is bullshit? There goes literacy. Really, it's a miracle the Priestess's stories have survived this long."
910,"True.     Actually that raises another question.    Why is this the only village for tens of miles? If this was the only civilisation to exist post-petrification, there should be other villages from people who left of their own accord or were exiled. And over 3000 years, those villages should also have splintered. If you have one idiot chief like that, someone would still hoard the information. The previous chief didn't like Sorcery and it's clearly culturally looked down on, yet that didn't stop Chrome building up supplies of weird things.    My point is, why the heck did Senku and co see   no signs of human life   for the entire time that they travelled up to this point?     I think in retrospect, this would all be a lot easier to swallow if it had been a few hundred years of post-petrification descendants of people who un-petrified, and thus the option to save information or uphold civilisation simply wasn't there. 3000 just really, really pushes it."
911,"I mean, even in modern times, if you're dropped in a completely random place in the world, the likelihood that you arrive anywhere near civilization, or anywhere close to any signs of civilization is little-to-none. Even if there were villages all around the world, it wouldn't be surprising to not run into any during a relatively short week or so long trip."
912,Without spoiling too much I can say the manga goes into this.
913,Yay!
914,"Err, read the manga."
915,That's a  very  good question that is answered later on. Sadly it probably won't be covered by the anime unless we get a season two.
916,     They do have agriculture. They grow watermelons. There was a scene where Magma has harvesting them from their field.
917,"They clearly have some kind of agriculture. Lots of shots around the village have shown vegetables and whatnot lying around. Sukia has easy access to melons whenever she has to replace her hat as well. I don't think they're repeatedly scavenging in the forest for all of that.    It's true that they don't have cattle, but they do live on a weird rock pillar surrounded by ocean and wild lions, so there's that. They probably don't have a ton of cattle species to choose from."
918,"I'll be honest., I think I missed most of that. Someone else pointed out melons and I honestly thought Suika was just using a wild one."
919,"Well there hasn't really been much focus on it, but I'm pretty sure you're meant to assume they have some limited form of agriculture. They're not growing wheat or anything, but they are eating some greens along with their fish."
920,"It's something, at least. Gives them a good starting point. Or would if Japan's geography was particularly good for farming."
921,"Want to etch that knowledge in metal, Normal paper going to not last much past hundred years or so.   Taking all the Parchment you can find gives you more centuries but still in Japan climate it not going to last."
922,"I'd say stone is better than Metal, provided you make sure wherever you write is not exposed to the elements so some big wall in a cave, for example. That stuff can last thousands of years - even if painted, as much of the Ancient Egyptian writings prove."
923,"     Afaik gasoline only lasts a few months and you need to mix it with preservatives to make it last longer, so even with just 6 people they would have to start making their own fuel within a couple of years since the supplies left at gas stations would've started to go bad by then."
924,"Yeah, they'd basically have to learn how to restore an oil refinery and keep it in good working order or develop alternative sources of power. Which, granted, already exist, but that doesn't mean any of them know how to keep those in good working order."
925,"     As someone who works in an oil refinery now, that is fully staffed and funded, even keeping it in good working order now is extremely non trivial. There's not even a slightly realistic scenario where those 6 people could manage a facility like that on their own. For so many different reasons. The least of which is that you need an incredible amount of energy to run an oil refinery, in the form of electricity and chemical energy from combustion of hydrocarbons that would be impossible to acquire."
926,"Also they don't even need caves, it's not like the earth blew up, all the infrastructure are still there when they first return, they just need to figure out how to maintain them with minimal manpower, scaling down essential infrastructures help a lot, guess we have to wait for next ep to see what exactly happened there as I doubt the village is 3000 years old."
927,"Gasoline can go ""bad"" and lose its combustibility within 6months to 2 years, even in ideal storing conditions. Diesel fuel can last for a year under ideal storing conditions."
928,"They probably tried some of this at first, but no way they could keep things running for 3000 years when they have no way to produce materials required to repair it, let alone keep around the knowledge of how to repair something. And they did preserve as much old knowledge as they could, that's what the 100 stories are."
929,"It took humanity several   hundreds of thousands   of years to go from stone tools to what we have now. Though they did have a head start, considering the founding 6 were mostly scientists."
930,Yeah like we were majorly hunter gatherers for almost the majority of Homo Sapiens existence. They're doing pretty alright for 3000 years.
931,This will be futher be explained
932,"     That's a good point.    Lets look at Girl's Last Tour. The cities of concrete  steel have survived for more than 1000 of years, which should be entirely possible, even with today's technologies. Some infrastructure like electricity  lighting  water  automatic metro and some other automations were still working.    Even after 3000 years, certain robust and primitive technologies should still be intact. We don't see any of that in Dr. Stone."
933,Because Mt.Fuji. Also Senku did find a bronze statue.
934,"Try ""Life after People"" a science based show which would indicate that DR Stone got the decay right in a active place like Japan."
935,"My theory is that the existing technology held them back.  They were nowhere near knowledgeable enough to understand how any of it worked talking about descendants of course, so if 85% of the people spent their time trying to figure it out instead of natural advancement, their lives would be wasted.  I'd imagine that the percentage would slowly erode over time with nobody making any progress, so after about 1000 years, you have many villages with different levels of advancement that decided at different times to stop trying.  The tech is gone, they made little to no progress in understanding it, and now they have to start from scratch while having these religions about ""the before times"" where technology existed.  Of course they called it magic, but there was proof of it so some of the more curious people would always try to figure out how to use this magic.  We see that in this arc.  A kid with no connection or knowledge has figured out minuscule things.  But his ""magic"" is useless so it wouldn't be passed on.  The curiosity of humanity is what advances it, so taking a huge portion of the curious individuals out of the breeding pool leads to no advancement.  I'm ranting at this point, but you get the idea."
936,Theres still a possibility people broke free like Senku
937,"It's possible, but Senku only broke free because he stayed conscious, Taiju stayed concious but needed the nitric acid dripping on him to break free. Even if someone else did stray conscious for the 3700 years, and then broke free like Senku, the chances of them surviving are kind of small, and the chances of that happening to enough people in one area which survive long enough to start a settlement is miniscule"
938,"So far I thought there was another human like Senku who woke up, discovered the nitric acid method and woke a bunch of people up. This person than died in an accident or something and the village lost the knowledge to unpetrify people. Something like 5 or so generations ago."
939,"wait, senku woke up in the cave with the dripping hitting on him right?    do you think his father had come back to earth, found senku, mourned and then done everything to save senku, placing him under the liquid solution for him to place his faith for senku in the future?"
940," No, Senku was just in some random clearing, Taiju was the once placed under the Nitric acid drip after Senku found the cave with the bat guano."
941,"What's weird to me, that if village was founded in the same place it is now and never was relocated, then it's really close to Senku's hometown. When astronauts landed there were still cities and infrastructure, landscape didn't change at all. So why Byakuya never went to Senku's school and found his petrified body and tried to preserve him? Or he did, what happened to his statue then? What villagers even think of human statues around them? So many questions"
942,     He broke free because of nitric acid. That's the only thing that breaks anyone free. When he is trying to figure out why he was freed he went back to the place where he stayed as a statue and saw a bat flying very close to his spot — Senku found a cave nearby and the source of nitric acid.
943,"I couldn't quite remember so I went back to the manga chapter to check, and though I may be wrong, it looks like when Senku is shown breaking free he isn't in the cave, he's just lying in some grass. When he goes to the cave as he's thinking about how he broke free, he is just looking around his surroundings and finds something he thinks may have broken him free.    All of what I said could be wrong, I don't think it is but it could be. I went to chapter 16 of the manga to check if you want to look yourself"
944,I've read the manga too. In the manga he says that to break free he needed something external so we are left to interpret that whatever revived him came from the ground like a stream and etc and he looks towards the cave.    However on episode 6 of the anime they deliberately show a bat flying too close and headed towards the cave nearby.
945,"Fair point, I concede"
946," Except that he would still be too far from the cave for any nitric acid to reach him. Nitric Acid decomposes too quickly to last from flowing from the cave entrance to wear Senku was, and even then, we're outright shown in the show that nitric acid isn't enough unless you were conscious or in taiju's case semi-conscious for the 3000 years as everyone else needs Nital, and Nital isn't naturally occurring."
947,"In the anime they even show bats flying close to Senku's petrification site which means he was guano target for thousand of years. In the manga he even says there's a key to his revival behind his head which is the cave direction. The acid doesn't need to necessarily have flowed to him from the cave but the manga heavily implies that.    Him staying fully conscious doesn't mean anything, he was just curious where all that energy was coming from and he realized it was from the stone itself. It has nothing to do with one's ability to wake up from it.    Nital only helps with instant unpetrification."
948, There were other statues in the area next to his. If maintaining consciousness was not part of the reason he broke free then why didn't any of the other statues revive as well?
949,He was the closest to the cavern and I presume there was a bit of luck due to how random landscape formation is through time.
950," You're reaching, just stop, it's embarrassing. Not to mention that you're ignoring that the story places emphasis on the fact that Senku and Taiju remained conscious during their petrifications, if that didn't matter it wouldn't have been made note of. Nor would Senku have been written to consider how much energy he'd have needed to remain conscious during that time and implying that the stone was consumed to due so."
951,"     I admit I am wrong about Senku staying conscious not helping with unpetrification. I just re-read that part, I stand corrected and I do feel embarrassed.    But thinking alone wouldn't be enough and Senku still needed some nitric acid which is my main point replying to the parent post of this whole discussion. The cave, the bats, his location and all that. He then sees a strand of his hair getting unpetrified with a drop of guano, there's also emphasis on that. Could it be a clue that for nitric acid alone it needs the help of the consciousness burning through all that energy?    I don't know, it's just too convenient how close he is to the cavern and how the anime puts emphasis on the bat flying nearby towards it."
952,"Not necessarily since we don't know the properties of the phenomenon that turned them to stone.    For instance, water is great for absorbing radiation and, while only pitch black at a depth of 1000+ meters, there isn't significant light beyond 200 meters in the ocean which means it is likely submarines at a normal operating depth escaped with people untouched.    Additionally, how well the green light's effects penetrate dirt, rock, concrete, steel, or iron can mean people in bunkers or even just deep caves at the time of the event could be fine. Unlikely as it is but, given the right circumstances, even some people in basements with no windows or similar rooms might've been able to escape petrification.    And that's not even getting into the chance some other person might've been freed like Senku 1000 monkeys at typewriters style of probability or the fact that, if the phenomenon was man-made, there might be people who knew to how to not be petrified or at least prepared for it. All this is conjecture since I don't read the manga but there is still hope for other settlements out there."
953,And somehow they still speak Japanese after 3000 years :
954,"There may have been other space stations, or humans who were shielded from the catastrophe by other means like maybe some were living in some kind of shelters that shielded you from the radiation or we caused the mutation."
955,Byakuya sounds drunk.  I miss my Dad he always challenges me to aim higher. Now as a dad myself i understand now that as a parent you want to the next generation to be better
956,That's deep learning and feels from an anime! Kawaii
957,Im looking forward on finishing Onepiece together with my grandchild
958,Implying One Piece will be over in our lifetime
959,Goals
960,So you're telling me that this village is actually 3700 years old? With so few people and the stories passed down throughout all those years still exist?     blankblink
961,"I mean humans tend to stick to traditions when in constant danger like surviving that world so passing down the stories is not that unlikely, especially if its the main job of the village vice-head       The genetics is a different problem though, maybe they met some chinese astronauts?"
962,"When the petrification happens in-story 2016-2017ish, no one in space except for the ISS astronauts. So unless they introduce a fictional space station that was also in operation when the petrification happens, probably not."
963,what if the people under the sea are also unaffected? Maybe some survived in submarines somewhere.
964,"The ray affects underwater, so submarines would still be screwed"
965,Sperm banks were still functional.     Genetics isn't that big of a problem everyone is making it out to be or else we would never find isolated tribal villages today.
966,Starting with 30 people is incredibly different  than starting with just 6 people though
967,"It makes sense that the stories get passed down, but the 3000 years bit is a bit hard to believe. They managed to keep the names and all the details exactly the same?"
968,It's very unlikely that an oral tradition could remain that well preserved for close to 4 millenia.
969,"I don't think that's impossible. Some of the really old biblical stories were passed down fairly accurately by many generations before being written down. There are many really dedicated Jewish scholars today who memorized the entice Tanya. Other religions have those people as well.    With enough dedication, I think it is possible to pass these 100 stories down for  150 generations."
970,"     It's  possible , but if only one of those 150 people happened to be anything less than a diligent zealot, it's ruined."
971,You don't need to be smart. You'll memorize the stories until you know them perfectly. As priestess this will be the one and only purpose of your life. You've got many years to memorize.
972,"The Griots in many African societies prove that it's not only possible, but actually fairly common for small communities to have a dedicated history keeper that keep records for many generations.    100 stories really is not that many for someone who's whole life is dedicated to them. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that the role of priestess would be expected to learn the stories and in exchange is treated as a royal class within the community.    Yes, 3700 years is a REALLY long time. Yes, a single mistake, a single early death, a single rebellious kid who changes the story  could  ruin it, but the chance of that happening in any given generation is low enough that I don't really find it all that difficult to suspend my disbelief of it not happening at all."
973,The manga will a bit later actually bring up why there aren't as many humans in the village as could be
974,"There are some aboriginal groups in northern Australia who have fairly accurate oral traditions about the geography of land that used to be good hunting ground, 10,000 years ago before it was submerged beneath the ocean by melting glaciers."
975,"     With no knowledge of medicine and natural predators and a thick jungle preventing border growth, I think it makes some sense. Average life expectancy is probably real low. Have you noticed that there's only one person over the apparent of age like 60 and he's fit as? Ruri was about to die at 16 of pneumonia too."
976,"For the VAST majority of human race existing, we were tribes of small number of people.      Keep in mind, 50,000 years ago we, homo sapiens, were roaming the Earth in small tribes, and didn't create massive civilizations until only 10,000 years ago or so.  3700 years is NOTHING by comparison.     It was the founding of agriculture that turned us from nomads to civilizations.  And Ishigami village doesn't seem to be very advanced in agriculture."
977,"I mean, why not? There are stories being passed on for thousands of years in our modern culture."
978," hail Lillian    The population creator    Also, Byakuya is such an interesting character, as expected of Senku's father    It's heartbreaking Senku won't be able to meet him anymore."
979,"Yeah, what a legacy he left for his son. Before this episode I figured his dad was probably still petrified so there was hope he would be revived, but seeing as he wasn't affected it we can only hope he lived to a ripe old age and clearly was very dead by the time Senku woke up. Hopefully his Dad's legacy will carry on through Senku and the world he wants to rebuild."
980,"I had been wondering why Senku wasn't looking for his dad's 'statue'. I know he's on the run from Tsukasa essentially, but seems like Tsukasa would get him on his smashing spree. Of course now we know that didn't happen."
981,Is this The 100?
982,Or is the 100 Dr Stone?
983,well who knows
984,"No, it's The 6"
985,"Ok, how does astronauts normally gets back to Earth from space?"
986,"Currently? They cram inside a Soyuz capsule and proceed to do their reentry procedures. However, given nobody on Earth was there to monitor them I wouldn't be surprised if they came back in a ballistic reentry and likely landed far from the normal wildness of Kazakhstan.    Also. There is the question of seats. The Soyuz seats 3. They have 6. So either there was two return capsules at the ISS or they modified the capsule prior to leaving."
987,Looks like there was another docked at the station when Senku's Dad arrived.
988,"Good attention to detail, under normal circumstances the ISS has a Soyuz that is docked for the sole purpose of acting as a crew return vehicle. They get rotated out every few missions. So assuming the CRV and the capsule the 3 new crew arrived in was still docked they'd be covered. I suppose it all depends on how many days between arrival and the catastrophe."
989,The singer was a tourist. They needed one to get back down.
990,She was suppose to be there for 1 week.
991,3 or 4 days maybe?
992,"     Or through anime magicplot convenience, the sea of Japan."
993,"There are always enough Soyuz capsules attached to the ISS to bring everyone back home. Basically, a new crew of 3 come up through one capsule. Then there's 6 or less crew on board the ISS and attached are two capsules. Then, 3 crew deboard on the older capsule to ensure the Soyuz capsules cycle and there is always enough capsules"
994,The ISS has a pair of Soyuz capsules docked at all times in case of an emergency. They each can hold 3 passengers allowing the whole crew to escape. Luckily for them they are pretty low-tech in how they land being a reentry pod with a parachute so they won't need ground control to prepare for a flight landing like you would need with a shuttle style craft that's been proposed as an escape craft in the past.
995,"Re-entry pod. Checkout the movie ""Gravity"""
996,"Given the rest of Gravity's science, I wouldn't trust it to be accurate in anything like that. It happens to be right with the re-entry pods, but its track record is real bad."
997,"i was under the impresion gravity was pretty faithfull, the only hollywood detail was the hubble and the 2 space stations being conveniently close but the science was pretty good"
998,"Naa, the orbital mechanics didn't make sense. The debris field somehow follows our MC through the movie for some reason. If there was a debris field at a significantly different velocity it would be in a different orbit and it would take far longer for their orbits to match even if it was somehow miraculously on target. But judging from the speed of the debris, it wouldnt have been significantly faster and so it wouldn't work. Even if the space stations are close in terms of orbit, you can't just move from one to another unless it's like a kilometre away at which point why even have two space stations and risk collision. You need to change your orbit twice to match position and velocity with the other station if it's not literally next door. The whole premise of the accident happening in the first place without forewarning makes no sense.    The astronaut qualifications are also ridiculously lax. MC would never make it near space with the personal issues she has. Neither would the guy goofing off in space on an EVA for no reason.    The Martian is a much more scientifically accurate Hollywood movie. The astronauts don't have potentially dangerous unresolved personal issues, and its orbital mechanics make sense.    I recommend trying Kerbal space program if you want to know more. A little time there helps a lot in understanding how space travel works."
999,"there are a few landing craft docked to the ISS at all times, which can be used to land in the event of an emerency"
1000,"Senku's dad doesn't get alot of screen time, but he's easily in my top 3 guys in this manga.  Heck the first time we saw him was in a flashback and he might not have been present, but he sold his car or something to buy Senku's equipment to experiment with. Also love the relationship he has with his son. They are both emotional and invested in their hobbies, but support each other in their own ways.  You can't help,  but be drawn to both of them and like them."
1001,"Okay, I was wondering if petrification happened to people on the ISS. Who would’ve known Senku’s dad was one of them? Also that shot from space definitely looks like the petrification came from space, doesn’t it?"
1002,It looks like more of  a surface explosion that radiated out
1003,"Yeah, it kind of reminded me of some kind of...mega nuke.     I doubt we'll ever get a timely explanation on what actually caused it but my money is on ""Accidental Bioweapon""."
1004,"Im not sure how accidental it is if they were testing it on birds before the actual human petrification. It's unlikely, but I like the theory that aliens caused this just to see how we'd react"
1005,"It didn't just hit every bird though, looked like they had it targetting them around the world. Assuming it was a weapon they probably thought they had it down and could hit targeted humans."
1006,What I really want to know is who built a device to petrify humans and what they could possibly stand to gain from it.
1007,"I mean, look at its healing properties so far, willing to bet it was some guy experimenting on heating, but kept fucking it up on birds. One big fuckup and 3000 years later..."
1008,"Well, my first thought is Triti from the Trauma Centre games - an attempt at an artificial pathogen that can petrify parts of the body to heal them or else preserve them when in critical condition, gone out of control and become virulent.    Though in Dr Stone's case it's clearly not some kind of pathogen - but I'm thinking the same concept."
1009,"I don't think of a surface explosion. It has the lower hemisphere of the explosion visible, so it was either very high altitude explosion or an impact.    If it was high altitude the ISS should be affected, shouldn't it? They clearly have line of sight to it."
1010,They probably should have been if it was some sort of explosive effect that was that big. But we saw that the world at large was unaffected except for humans being petrified. So likely the petrification isn't anything physical considering it can go all the way around the world. Though if it's not physical I'm not sure why the ISS crew weren't affected.    No clue.
1011,That's why I'm thinking it had to be an impact of some kind - that way it would spill over the Earth and not explode all around.
1012,"It wasn't a single event, it's likely people were testing something that caused the swallows to petrify for a few days before it went full melt down."
1013,But then doesn't Senku has a map of Eurasia on screen when he investigates the swallows and the explosion thingy was in North America. Something's not right here.
1014,"I thought he said the swallow petrification was happening all over the world, not just Eurasia."
1015,The report says its everywhere swallows live the whole world.
1016,"He has literally this map with found stone swallows.     It only shows them in Eurasia and two continents definitely count as ""around the world"", no?    Though since North American swallows are the same species there might be some. Doesn't scroll that far."
1017,You even managed to screenshot the part of the report that says around the world.
1018,On which there are no X's anywhere else than in Europe and Asia.     I can screenshot it without subs if you're that bothered with it. :P
1019,It's almost like that map doesn't show any of the other swallow populations that were affected.
1020,Maybe the thing that caused petrification didn't get inside ISS? Inside of the ISS is isolated from the environment.
1021,"yep, and it most likely was a weapon for which the petrified birds were a genetic targeting test run"
1022,"When you rewatch the scene, it looks like it came from North Americe, classic one Japan :D"
1023,USA! USA!
1025,I think this is a spoiler since I’m pretty sure they are going to cover that in the next episode...
1026,"No, they changed the line to him saying that all of Twitter stopped at once"
1027,"I just checked, they said the exact same lines in the manga."
1029,RIP miso blob     toradorasalute
1030,You can see which character's direct grandkids are:    Shamil - Magmar    Dalia - The 3 sisters    Lilian - Ruri and Kohaku    Yakov - the old blacksmith    Connie - Suika    Byakuya - ?
1031,Shamil looks like Kinro wearing a Ginro wig so I guess both of them are his descendants.
1032,tbh Shamil looks like Strongest High Schooler Monkey Man Tsukasa but blonde if anything
1033,"Shamil's surname ""Volkov"" means ""of the wolf"" in Russian. Kinro's and Ginro's names mean ""gold wolf""  and ""silver wolf"" respectively."
1034,I mean it s like 3k years later ... hard to tell
1035,Connie - Chrome     I think she's chinese.
1036,I thought Connie's most direct descendent would be the girl with the exact same hairstyle but also buck teeth.
1037,"They are all their direct grandkids, in a way.    The first hand of the village has the same hair colour as Byakuya, too."
1038,"Jasper looks bit like him, at least the hair is white."
1039,I think Byakuya's decendant must be Chrome! The scientific and inquisitive mind runs in the family!
1040,"Over 3000 years, there would presumably be blood from each founder in all of the villagers. It's just a matter of how much in who."
1041,"If you look at the newest dr stone poster, you could see who is the descendant of who by just looking what their facial expressions are like. If they have the same facial expression, then they're related."
1042,Chrome also has the same hair colour as Connie
1043,"That must be terrifying, floating in space and seeing the whole world start glowing green, and suddenly you aren't able to contact anyone. Pretty interesting origin of the village, although I'm intrigued to see why they didn't de-petrify everyone sooner. Surely the scientists on the ISS could figure out you need that acid Senku made to reverse the petrification."
1044,"     Assuming it was even possible to revert it at this time. Acid is one thing but time might have been a huge factor too. Senku has estimated that it took 2 terajoules of energy used in thinking AND nitric acid for him to break free. For contrast - it took   63 TJ to blow up Hiroshima. That was just the difference between him and other people as well who must have stayed ""alive"" in some form considering that Tsukasa could be revived, that too might require some energy, possibly even more than that 2TJ.    With this in mind it's entirely possible that they might have tried all kinds of acids but nothing worked... plus if you open up a statue - it's just rock without any signs of ever being alive. Unless you have first applied this acid you wouldn't know it's even possible to revive someone."
1045,"Ah, that makes sense, I forgot that his ""thinking power"" was one of the factors that helped him break out of the stone."
1046,Senku broke free without the Acid didn't he?
1047,he had the nitric acid dripping on his head slowly over time combined with the energy he expended by thinking to keep himself alive. He needed Nital in order to get other things out of the petrified state
1048,"Hmm ok.         He was thinking to stay awake, not alive although how he didn't go crazy."
1049,IIRC it wasnt dripping on his head but in his surroundings which he absorbed
1050,"     I mean how would they? Senku got a headstart because he literally ""spawned"" besides the answer. They would need to test  everything  before figuring it out."
1051,"I thought he was near the cave that he ended up dragging his bro to. That was how he had come up with the theory that the cave was important. I might be wrong, though, I'd have to rewatch."
1052,"Yes, that's what I said. He woke up literally besides the answer the nitric acid in the cave."
1053,"My bad, I somehow replied to the wrong comment."
1055,"Do youo have any idea how big that ""everything"" is? It's not doable for 6 people busy trying to survive to just find each and every chemical on Earth and use it on people. You are just abousing meta-knowledge."
1056," Ehh, Senku so far has shown to a genius who knows basically everything from every field. We know that two of the astronauts are doctors, Lillian is a singer,  and Senku's dad is likely a college physics professor with the other two being unknowns. So far though, none of them are chemists, meaning they might not know about Nital.     Though, even if they did Nital might not work. Senku escaped his petrification by using it up through constantly thinking, and Taiju weakened his state by forcing himself to think about Yuzuhira until Nitric acid did the trick. Everyone else needs Nital, despite consuming their own shells for 3000 years.    What I'm getting at is that after the initial petrification everyone's stone forms would be fresh and new, unweakened from 3000 years of sustaining the recipient. Even the strongest acid wouldn't work."
1057,"Its something that comes up in sci-fihorror a decent amount after apocalypses and I'm glad they addressed it here.     Like for example in Zombie apocalypses. Astronauts are stuck in space unable to do anything but research, and they can't get new supplies. This situation where they can't even contact anyone would suck even more. How do they know that they won't get petrified immediately upon returning for example.     I'd say being an astronaut in one of these scenarios would suck worse than just dyingbecoming a zombiebeing petrified."
1058,"Even if they couldn't de-petrify people, I'm surprised they didn't manage to createpreserve technology. They started with five scientistsdoctors and most of the technology, materials, etc. of society intact and ripe for scavenging. But Senku was one guy in a cave and managed to beat them.    It seems like they should have been able to at least introduce simple machines and some of the other things that Senku built early-on.    Did the village regress seems contrary to Senku's confidence that inquisitive people like Chrome would eventually rebuild society?"
1059,"     Senku got a massive hint because he was depetrified next to a cave full of bats, which lead him to the nitric acid theory. Just being smart and going down the surface might not have been enough without this hint."
1060,"It made me think of the book World War Z. If you haven't read it, look it up it is nothing like the movie.    It is a series of interviews, and through the interviews, it goes over the infection, panic, infestation, and all out war of zombies.  ""One of the people interviewed was an astronaut on the ISS during """
1061,"Oh man when I see the ED in this season I wanted his father son backstory but never actually expected they did, even it's a whole episode and continues!    I thought this series would just ignore backstories and explaining the cause of the personification, since it is just a plot device for Senku overpowering with science, and goes to purely afterstories. I'm more than happy they dig in the past and the origins."
1062,it was great to hear Leorio's voice again as Senku's dad after just finishing Hunter x Hunter. Throughout the episode I couldn't help but think how similar Leorio and Senku's dad are
1063,"     Ah, so that was it! The voice sounded so familiar but I couldn't quite place it."
1064, We Space Brothers now!     doggo      The 100th tale is Ishigami Senku?      PAPA SENKU       Papa Senku wanted to be an astronaut?  So Senku decided to goto space for his dad?  Aw.      Its great to see George again too back when they were kids.      HAHHAHAHA So Senku made a suit to help his dad swim?  Thats amazing xD      Dad Papa Senku passed the test!  Thats awesome!  I love how hes telling Jaxa about Senku too haha.      HIS DADS NAME IS BYAKUYA!?      So was he in space when the light happened?      That Diva looks just like Jane and Sis.      Connie looks like the Monkey and the blond boy looks like Kinro Ginro.  So all these people are the ancestors of the village huh?      THIS ENGLISH!  WOW WEE!  A+!      Senku was up to date on the birddemic before the light huh?      Papa Senku was like a Papa for everyone on board.  Hes a pretty great guy.      So a giant ball was also outside the planet before the stonning?  Like something hit the earth?  And yep the Astros were out of range...      Papa Senku wanted to go back to save humanity huh?  the last 6 people....sooo they gonna start a new colony?      So if this was right when it happens then that village is very old huh?  Im curious how it survived for all these years.
1065,"Ya, the village being  3700 years is absolutely the biggest suspension of disbelief I have with this story. Still love it to all hell though.     But just considering how fast new languages appear in our history old english ended around 1150 and middle english only lasted until about 1470.      Then there is the considration of new religions Just looking at Christianity, the great schism occured between Orthodox Catholicism and Roman Catholicism at around 1054 and then the Protestant Reformation happened ""shortly"" after around 1500    Just looking at how fast cultures change and given that Ishigami Village doesn't have any writing system it can be considered a miracle that they still speak anything even close to modern japanese which itself is very young and has changed drastically over the last 1000 years.     Realistically we should expect the village to have under gone massive changes in both language and in the stories they tell. Looking at how fables change with time and new ones replace old ones there is no way there wouldn't be a change similar at least in scope to how Odin used to be called Wotan. Little changes like that would chip away at the 100 stories until they were unrecognizable. 3700 years is way to massive a time scale for human knowledge to pass unchanged.    Still, as far as it's unbelievable it still makes Dr Stone a fantastically entertaining story. :"
1066,"     It doesn't come through with the English subs, but the village's language is NOT traditional Japanese, it's a mix of Japanese with quite a few English words and phrases.         The entire priestesshood, 100 stories, founders etc is a religion by itself.         Since the village is located in a single location, and is not an entire country spread around, they really don't have any need for written language, apart from basic drawings that they do actually have."
1067,"     And to add to that, wasn't there a point early on where Senku was confused about how some of their stories seemed off? There's definitely some Telephone Game going on here."
1068,"     Unchanged? Probably. But there are actually cases where it looks like oral history has been passed down accurately enough to describe interactions with animals that went extinct 10,000 years ago."
1069,I feel like at some point Senku said the village could only be a few hundred years old though. Am I making that up?
1070,I think that would be working on the assumption that the founders were petrified like him.
1071,The priestess has to memorize the 100 stories verbatim.  It's not like passed down folk tales.
1072,"""Verbatim"" isn't that foolproof over long time periods. The words themselves change in both pronunciation and meaning over time."
1073,     THAT'S why he looked familiar! I was thinking about it but I couldn't place it! Nice catch!
1074,The big beard guy looks like the village cheif.
1075,Something that seems kinda odd is that I'm pretty sure the human race needs minimum like 200 people to make sure theres no breeding issues caused by blood relation right? Someone sciencey correct me if I'm wrong and hopefully clarify if that's the case?
1076,This kinda explains Kohaku and Ruris eye distance
1077,"After a quit google its theorised that around 100 ish would be recomended to avoid any inbreeding issues. Others have pointed out that bad eyesight seems kinda common especially considering how young some of the characters who have the furry sight are. 3000 years wouldn't have been enough time for evolution to sort out the all kinds of fucky the genetics would have gotten when you start repopulation with just 6 people. Youd honestly need to start a breeding chart to really optimise things just to make sure you're not getting any Alabama sauce in your baby mix.        I believe that the issues of blood relation are mitigated as far as second cousins so they would have had to have been so insanely selective with their breeding the first few generations that the concept of love would be foreign. This actually kinda could be carried onto why the village leader is picked through a fight just to fuck the priestess they compete for the  strongest  genes to win since physical strengths means nothing for leading and governing, it's all about genes"
1078,"Needs like 100 people to be free of risk. There can be viable populations starting with less people, but it carries risk. That's different from being impossible to sustain without genetic issues.    That said, 6 people is a damn small pool to start with. All that's needed is a chance that it works out properly though. It didn't need to be a good chance since really, there was no other option other than to try."
1079,"     Space Family, I guess...         This indeed looked more like an external impact rather than an explosion from the surface. Not that it makes anything clearer, because something like that coming to Earth should be detected...."
1080,Also... Eskimo Brothers.
1082,Was waiting for that. Im also glad that they extended some scenes
1083,"I really, really enjoy the fatherson relationship between Byakuya and Senku. Even though they weren’t in consistent communication before the event, you could tell they were rooting for each other. The ED already made me tear up before this episode and it hit harder this morning."
1084,"Fucking hell, of course it started in America. So since it didn't affect anyone in space I guess it's not a light but instead of some kind of nanomachine cloud or something. Really looking forward to find out what caused this.    Guess having the whole world hear you sing just got a lot easier."
1085,Getting the ground zero of the petrification is probably the most important reveal in this episode. Hopefully the astronauts passed down that particular piece of information as it'll help a lot in figuring out exactly what caused it.
1086,"My guess is given it's healing effects shown with his neck it was meant to be an amazing cure-all self replicating nanomachine that got released ice-9 style. Early testing was on a sparrow, not knowing that it spread across the globe. Then they synthesize the human version and WHOOPS. Accidental apocalypse."
1087,Classic Grey   Goo   Stone scenario.
1088,What’s Grey goo?
1089,Grey Goo
1090,"Fun note is how life has been nicknamed ""green goo""."
1091,Even funnier is we managed to replicate primordial ooze and it's a brown sludge.
1092,Thanks
1093,Learned something new. Thanks
1094,Looks more like Central America to me
1095,Yeah it looks like it started in the Amazon.
1096,"My guess would be Yucatán, like the dinosaur destroying asteroid."
1098,I blame Canada.
1099,"That's Venezuela, the Caribbean, or the American south"
1100,That's just how badass America is... Also the hottest characters are American.
1101,"Bout time for some answers. And holy crap were those some good answers. Survivors from the international space station that is so cool, I love it. Granted there's more answers to be had but man this was a good start. Also lucky huh that the space station has an equal number of males and females on board.      Also that was some training regiment Senku put his dad through."
1102,"I spoiled the ISS thing for myself last week because I just couldn't wait to find out the twist but irregardless what a great episode. Byakuya is a goat.    I may be somewhat Isekai trash but honestly this is the Anime I live for. A truly unique premise, a truly unique idea that's been done so well.    For me this is Attack on Titan 2."
1103,"This show really does make me feel like AoT doesdid, definitely will be one of the goats along it"
1104,I spoiled minor details from last episodes for myself too. Like Ruri getting married to Senku and Byakuya being an astronaut.
1105,"Senku's dad was quite the eccentric, and now we know where he picked up a few of his quirks from. I see they cast Fujiwara Keiji to be the best father in yet another series. Good fit for the humble fellow with a corny sense of humor.    That's a pretty tragic view to be in Space during the moments where the entire world becomes petrified. The idea of being one of the last remaining members of a species is a pretty mortifying thought.    So next episode we'll get more of how they came back to earth and how they eventually established Ishigami village? I'm curious if this might be an indicator that  ""Ruri and Kohaku are actually related to Senku through a long generational gap, or if that's a red herring.""   Please don't actually answer this, I want to find out next episode or so.  "
1106,What other series has he been a dad in?
1107,"He was Leorio in HxH, and people like to refer to Leorio as best dad for Gon."
1109,You're welcome. :
1110,"He's also Father Fujimoto in Blue Exorcist, another Best Dad :"
1111,Inb4 someone changes his wiki description somewhere to best dad
1112,As a show that prides itself on its scientific accuracy I really hope they have a good explanation for how 6 people can lead to a small Japanese speaking village over 3000 years later.
1113,"I'd imagine if the ""100 stories"" was the basis of their culture, they have a pretty static reference for language."
1114,probably incest
1115,Welcome to the ''tagged Sci-Fi''
1116,"THIS IS SO GOOD, SO GOOD, SO GOOD!    How does this have so few upvotes? How are so few people talking about this anime? It's one of the best things I've ever seen."
1118,"I'm trying to catch up with the manga, but I'm still behind the anime, I wish I had more time."
1119,Don't feel too bad. I read the Manga before the anime was announced but I constantly have moments of feeling jealous of the anime only viewers because of this nice adaption. :
1121,"  Stitches!      Shocked Senku      Surprised Ruri      Byakuya's New Suit      Astronaut Byakuya      Diva Lilian      Determined Byakuya    Well now we know why the village has so many hot ladies.    And I'm so happy that Lilian's intro was just a prank, she adorable!    Really strong chemistry between Lilian and Byakuya. I ship them hard.    So whatever that green energy was, it clearly came from space. From the ISS's POV, it looks like it started somewhere near the Americas?    Ohhhhh boy.    But seriously though! I didn't expect the village to be so old! I was expecting that the village was founded by someone who thawed first but apparently the village has existed for three millenniums now. And with only six people to repopulate the Earth? I'm interested to see how they made it work. Like it clearly worked for them since the current village exist but   HOW?   I guess they prioritized the survival of humanity over anything else.      I am happy though that we're finally getting some answers!"
1122,I just had to
1123,thank you
1124,Thanks for the stitches!
1125,We have no evidence there are not more villages or nomadic tribes out there.   We do have strong evidence that original village government system was overthrown at some point. They would not have set up a best fighter rules system. In fact that system one of the weakest parts of story as I can't think of any primitive tribe which used anything like that. Primitive tribes most often some version of elder council and a bit less often a experienced leader often from battle rules but it a vote in for life type deal normally not some contest and it for using brains and brawn not just brawn. Occasionally and often a sign tribe came from failed civilization the rule passing down the Male or Female line of original leader. Female line systems can still be very male driven and have advantage of no question of who actually has blood right to rule. The almost complete loss of how to run a society knowledge was lost. I'm sure they started a primitive school system and had a elected town hall government at the start. Has to be some sort of youth revolt andor disaster that got our current system. Maybe all adults lost in disaster and oldest child a girl retaining just the limited tales learned at a still quite young age.
1126,tfw you will never repopulate the Earth with a world famous singer
1127,The apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree
1128,"Hundred tales - HyakuMonogatari. Sounds like another Monogatari adaptation. So, in 5000th year Shaft will release 100th season. Sounds plausible."
1129,you joke but
1130,I still got teary eyes even though I know what's coming on this episode.    I can't imagine myself with 5 other people to save the entire humanity on this kind of predicament.
1131,i didnt expect that sudden english song
1132, No one is gonna talk about that song that Lillian sang?       It sounded like it came straight from a Disney movie. Hot Damn.
1133,"ya, i couldnt find a link of that video on youtube.     That was an amazing song, i was expecting a japanese engrish song but it sounds pretty well done."
1134,"3 couples + 3000 years later should result in a ton of villages, there would be thousands of new gen people by now. Where is everyone"
1135,"Dead due to famine and lack of infrastructure. Senku currently has a similar problem: not enough manpower. 6 people can't possibly man the infrastructure of a city or small town by themselves and also produce enough food to survive.    Other small villages should exist in this world, as earlier it's mentioned by one of the villagers that exiles of the village do exist, so it makes sense after generations for more villages to spring up.     ""Byakuya and the ISS crew actually try to land near Japan because the phenomenon started over Brazil, and they land on an isolated island, so they had to reach the mainland first too, that should take some good time.""    There's also the question of inbreeding and stuff, but the author said that it simply just worked in this world."
1136,"     Ah yes the good old ""Shut up it just works""  argument."
1137,"Thousands yes but without medicine, tech etc. The moment the existing tech breaks down and knowledge doesnt persist between generations, it's back to the stone age. So the village can only be as big as the surroundings can provide for i.e. a primitive village. Kinda makes sense imho"
1138,"OK, Senku's dad, also known as Byakuya, is a badass motherfucker who decided to descend from the heavens and be humanity's savior. Fucking hell this is fucking epic!"
1139,And his son revived from the dead too. I've seen it before.
1140,And on the   3rd   millennia after petrification.
1141,"This is such a cool addition to the story. I was confused why there were suddenly astronauts on the new visual key and why the woman who I thought was Ruri was among them but this explains everything and it's such a great backstory. I never even considered the possibility that there could've been people in space who were never affected by the apocalypse - but while it's a great way to develop the story, it's really sad that Senku will never meet his father again. Now I know why he was crying in his sleep in the ED."
1142,Jesus can you imagine seeing a nuclear war break out from the ISS
1143,You could always go kamikaze and aim the station to drop directly on Pentagon. That will teach those warmongering assholes.
1144,I'm pretty sure there were a lot of stories about that during and right after the Cold War.
1145,Best story-time ever.    The episode I've been waiting for awhile now
1146,I started reading the manga shortly after the anime was announced and this has been the chapter I've been waiting to see animated since the moment I read it. I honestly expected the end of the season to be this back story so I'm interested to see where it ends up in 8 episodes.
1147,"I don't really understand why people are so fixated on this ""repopulated by 6 people"" thing. If Senku figured out how to undo petrification, it's possible that Byakua did too. This would provide an influx of gene pool to repopulate. It's also possible that some people broke out of petrification on their own during the lifetime of either the original crew or their offsprings."
1148,"Because it potentailly introduces a plothole: why didn't they rescue their immediate kin? Or at the very least, we can assume that the russians are too far, and connie may not have any kin perhaps. But surely Byakuya who cared so much for his son that they'd pass down a story about him would have done so if he had the ability to do so.    So we can assume that they didn't have this ability."
1149,"If that's the case, why is it such a tiny village"
1150,"This is a small thing, but I really appreciate having an alternate perspective on Senku in the form of his father. Despite being the main character, this series has mainly been from the view of other characters like Taiju and the villagers. We learn about Senku's schemes as they do, making him seem like more of a science-fueled superhuman than an actual person. But seeing his early failures and his father characterizing him as a bit of a brat that is too preoccupied with his work to appreciate his family's achievements is really humanizing. I hope the upcoming cour goes further in on that because it could help what I consider to be the weakest link in the story right now."
1151,this show keeps giving
1152,I am perpetually impressed by how fucking bad ass this show is with the bare minimum of violence.     That shot with best dad is powerful.
1153,Something about the way the petrification was depicted in the anime hit me harder than it did in the manga. The human emotions the crew had were on better display.
1154,"I'm probably alone in this, but I teared up 3 times. The first, seeing Senku push his father to achieve his dream of going to space. The second, the mini concert on the ISS broadcast worldwide. The third, seeing all of mankind come to a screeching halt in an instant, and the crew scrambling to figure out what was going on.    This episode was quite the emotional roller coaster for me..."
1156,Oh God no.    I'm assuming you've read the manga then?
1158,"I'm sure I will. Between this show, new games and the start of a one week vacation, next week really cannot come soon enough."
1161,The ED makes much more sense now and its sad too.
1162,Wow such an epic revelation this episode !    Lilian is top tier waifu OMG! The sisters inherited perfect genes. The song was fantastic! And what's the song title btw?    I'm so excited for next week :
1163," A Little Step"" by Laura Pitt-Pulford  "
1164,Im just wondering if anyone knows the title of the English Song sang by lillian in the middle and the piano piece when byakuya was describing senku @ 05:00   ish
1165,"The english song is  A Little Step"" by Laura Pitt-Pulford  "
1166,I feel so stupid for not checking rhe credits now     Thanks saviour
1167,"no problem, hopefully someone made a clip of that song."
1168,TALES FOR THE AGES
1169,Senkuu making that suit so his dad could pass the swimming test was a really nice moment. I really like Senkuu's dad he has a fun personality and seems like a good guy.
1170,Last week we knew Ishigami was the last name of Senku so that sparked something in me.  What about his family or family name that will come into play in this story?      Then came the new key visual which also came last week. I saw astronauts and a satellite-looking ship which bothered me.  YEAH! What about the people working at space stations?! The name Ishigami village wouldn't came out of nowhere. His father should have a role in this. They should also go back to Earth to see the situation. Feeling hopeless reviving someone they had to resort to repopulate with whoever his father was with. Then pass some knowledge generation to generation.      Take my guess last week as you will but I'm surprised about the story in this. I'm glad I am kinda right on my guess.       After watching this episode something bothered me. Were those 6 people the only ones in space? There should be other countries with their own man-handled space stations right?  
1171,"Even now in real life the only operational space station is the ISS with a crew of 6 so the show is very accurate on that part, it's also used by multiple countries just like in the show, countries don't have their own manned stations out there yet."
1172,Oh I am wrong then. Probably a good thing so it won't overcomplicate the story.
1173,"Yup. In the past, nations might have had their own stations such as the US Skylab and Russian Mir, but the ISS is a joint US-Russian-EU-ect project that most of the space-going nations use."
1174,Only China has plans to build their own. While NASA is still debating whether to keep the ISS around or not.
1175,"     Humanity kinda gave up on manned space missions. The ISS is where the most people are all the time, it is rare for more than 6 or so people to be in space at the same time."
1176,i wonder if people who happened to be underground were petrified
1177,Or submarines
1178,"Good question. Also people in rooms with no windows, basically unable to see the green light."
1179,"If that were the case there would be a ton of unaffected people, at any given time there's plenty of people in underground transportation or floors where you can't see any light coming from outside."
1180,"Underground transport might still be SOL if the people supporting the infrastructure go silent.    But even then, the Cheyenne Mountain base in the US is underground,  CERN has an underground division, and I'm sure there are more locations both classified and mundane who had to have been affected.    However I'm genuinely curious about submarines. There's that What If by XKCD followed radiation rules, and considering nuclear subs are built for long no-contact missions, that's a possibility."
1181,"It's not a visual thing, the light is caused by the change, not causing the change. You don't need to see it."
1182,The green light is more than likely a visual effect of the distortion. Everyone on the surface was affected.
1183,"Being underground alone might not be enough, but I would think that some people should have been able to survive in subs, and also in secured bunkers, like nuclear silos and that sort of thing."
1184,Senku fucking the blondes would be incest.
1185,The blondes fucking anyone in the village would be even worse incest though
1186,Say NO CHROMEO
1187,nah
1188,"6 humans left, 3 males, 3 females, 3 Adams, 3 Eves    it's very possible that people, at least some of them, at the village are related to Senku's dad, if Senku's dad got together with Lillian. who looks most similar to Kohaku and Ruri, then rip those ships"
1189,Most likely 3000 years have already mixed up the genes of the villagers. But hey its the same thing with our ancestors
1190,So these village ppl are related to Senku thru his father I assume?? The girls Kohaku and Ruri look exactly like that Lillian singer astronaut
1191,For those looking for Lilians song real life singer 
1192,"As soon as it went on about the rocket launch stuff I knew that Byakuya would be off the planet when the petrification happened. Although I'm not sure if 6 people so 3 bloodlines is a large enough gene pool to maintain a healthy population.    And if my memory serves correctly, didn't Senku briefly mention that he woke up in a different location than he petrified in? Maybe his dad found him and moved him into that bat piss cave because he knew it would wake him up eventually. If that's the case, and if Byakuya and the other weren't on the ISS when it happened, they wouldn't have been able to restart a primitive society, and humanity would have most likely gone extinct.   And I'm surprised that Ishigami Village is so small. They've been around for 3000-4000 years and they've had literally no competition whatsoever"
1193,"No Im fairly sure that the dam breaking washed Senku away, and thousands of years of outside interference just pushed him beside the cave."
1194,"Because I know people are thinking about it, genetics change with each generation. Studies show that we are more genetically similar to a stranger on the street than our direct ancestors four generations ago.     So in other words, 3000 years is enough for it to not count as incest.          Go gettem Senku!   "
1195,Really nuts and illuminating to see the petrification from space.
1196,"Best dad.     This must be a fun episode for anime only watchers! I need to read through the comments since I don't have much to add myself..     Senku's dad was a lot funnier with his voice actor than I had pictured him, what a dorky laugh. Haha. Also nice to hear the pretty singing."
1197,"The moment the dad said he's going to space my jaw dropped like ""that's the plot twist?!"" The village has been around for thousands of years?    What stopped Byakuya from rescuing Senku and others? Is it something about the petrification that it couldn't be reversed immediately? So many questions."
1200,"     Again, how would they even know about it? Senku had a lead to start his experiments but for anyone else the petrification may as well be magic."
1201,It did cross my mind that maybe they did try to research the problem for decades but just never stumbled on the solution
1202,"Senku got petrified while inside a building, when he ""woke"" up he was in a forest.    I dunno if concrete or whatever the building was made of can completely crumble into dust over 3700 years but assuming it can't, Senku seems to have been moved.    It's possible his dad may have had something to do with that.    Let's hope we find out!"
1203,I think it's implied that practically all buildings have crumbled to dust. The only structure we ever saw was the buddha statue because it's made of bronze. Of course it doesn't explain why Senku wasn't buried in rubble and dirt.
1204,     It totally can. After 3700 years with no maintenance there would be almost nothing left.
1205,"Damn, Byakuya! Guess things didn't go so well after Bleach."
1206,"The backstory on this episode was very impacting imo, seeing everything happening from the beginning was awesome"
1207,Basically Senkus suit for his father 
1208,That was funny. Just like Senku and Taiju.
1209,I was expecting the gantz suit lol.
1210,"now that I think about it, this episode really reminds me of ""please save my earth"" the manga."
1211,PSME was so sad. I loved it though.
1212,"Awesome episode, nice to get the backstory regarding the village name. Will definitely be picking up the manga, this anime has quickly become one of my favourites."
1213,"Just finished the episode, and correct me if I’m wrong because I’m working from memory here, but didn’t Senku say something at the start of the series about it not making sense that he woke up in a cave in such a convenient position?     DID SENKU’S DAD PUT HIM THERE?"
1214,"I haven't seen this episode, y'all got anywhere I can watch it?"
1215,"I love when shows have the time to have an episode like this. Such a wonderful change of pace and adds so much to the story and the world. Byakuya could have easily been some standard, anime dad that gets a few small scenes about this, but he's a full blown character and it's awesome.     I'd be very surprised if we don't get some kind of chart to try and figure out how long they could without any major inbreeding."
1216,"Are we all forgetting that Senku woke up in a cave with the exact requirement for undoing petrification right on top of him? He go petrified while in class, now of course evidently buildings are no more slightly surprising there aren't even any ruins but he most certainly couldn't have ended up in a cave without literally being put there. Maybe his father started figuring out actually how to undo it but kept it secret? if the secret wasn't kept, there would be so many more humans possibly."
1217,This episode just turned the anime Senku x Kohaku ship into a 3000 year old-wait  Alabama wincest.
1218,Senku is adopted. They mentioned it earlier in the series.
1219,"From their looks, I guess we could know who is the descendant of who. Lillian is obviously Kohaku and Ruri, and possibly Suika; Shamil might be Ginrou, Kinrou, Chrome, and possibly Magma; that big guy and his wife might be Kaseki's and;, and that connie girl mifht be that crazy haired girl with two hair spikes"
1220,After last episode I was wondering that senku and kohaku would be cousine but maybe the other raise the village and senku's father would be the chief
1221,"If the ED ended with the lyrics of the translated song it would be fantastic. Hope they translate soon, the lyrics fits perfectly."
1222,I wish I had a father.
1223,Just pretend he's gone into space to get you awesome scientific stuff.
1224,Does that mean Kohaku and Senku are far relatives?
1225,We are ALL distant relatives.
1226,"Close relatives if you think about it , as long as there really were only 6 people and senkus dad is related to them , due to a small gene pool their genes will be very related"
1227,"Now that was an turn of events I didnt expect      So wholesome for Senku to help his dad get into austronaut training.      Still kinda weird he was able to live on his own when his dad was away for training 5+ years           Having astronauts being uneffected by the magic green light is cool, but raises even more questions. Did they just happen to land back in japan? How long was the previous crew in space? Their muscles must have deteriorated and building them back up is hard, especially in a world with stone people            At last the village must have some crazy diseases if they didnt find other people to reproduce with...       Read somewhere that you would need 98 people to start a healthy population, 6 seems interesting for that kinda endevour            Super curious on how much time they are going to spend on his dad and the pre history of the story             At last, the ED is super sad with what we just learned..."
1228,"Not that long, maybe a few months."
1229,Is it even possible to have enough genetic diversity to sustain a breeding population with 6 humans? I thought it took more than that.
1230,"You thought wrong. 100,000 years ago all of humanity lived in sparse groups of 10-15 people tops. And here we are today. All descended from insane amount of incest."
1231,"No, I assume that we'll hear about how they dealt with that next week. Petrification aside this show has been very scientifically plausible. I can't imagine that they'd ignore the issue of genetic diversity."
1232,I don't know about anyone else but Senku's dad is low-key a SNACK....
1233,"For those wondering why ruri was singing to a large audience in the opening, here you go I guess lol.  It wasn't ruri!"
1234,THIS ANIME KEEPS GETTING BETTER!
1235,Every time I seehear Russian names... TT
1236,"Wow, now everything makes sense kk' But... Where is Senku's mother? o.O"
1237,saw Taiju & Yuzuriha after a good minute.
1238,what chapters was this episode?
1239,"42,43"
1240,ahh okay thanks so much
1241,Young senku is cute
1242,Man I forgot how much I liked Soyuz until this episode reminded me of how cool it is
1243,Anyone has the full song of Lilian?
1244,The singer and song are listed in the ED.
1246,senku is probably partly related to everyone in that village if his father had more kids there
1247,On this week's episode of Kanata no Dr. Stone...
1248,"Wow, kinda reminds me of the music video of Stuck ""In the Sound - Let's Go"".     Could have taken another direction if they were less fortunate then they were. I really like the similarities.           Here the video if anyone's curious"
1249,"Holy badass, the man that got Senku all that stuff to help him out is  a fucking astronaut AND the one that made the village.  Now THAT is top dad right there."
1250,chibi senku!  kawaii!!
1251,I wish I can watch it... damn net
1252,This episode somewhat reminded me of the book Seveneves
1253,Anyone else feel like the arcs of this show are too segmented? Like all the characters from the stone worldgunpowder disappeared once the village arc began and now we've left the village behind for the space station.
1254,Great episode
1255,Amazing episode
1256,"It may not be by blood, but technically Kohaku and Ruri are Senku’s nieces"
1257,"Yeah, but also technically, by that same standard,  everyone  is your cousin."
1258,ya what up cuz?
1259,True dat...  cuuuuuzzzzz 
1260,"damn that was intense haha. senku's dad is dope, like father like son. the evil guy forgot his name lol needs to hear senku's dad so he can stop harming adults."
1261,"Wow, that episode really hit me in the feels. I actually teared up a bit.     It does all make sense now. The astronauts made it back to earth and became the founders of that village and told stories of the old world to their children to be passed down."
1262,Wait for help? Nah. We are the help!
1263,That song made me tear up. Gave me Chris Hadfield vibes when he made the Space Oddity music video on the space station.
1264,Lel this is sad in manga Taiju was raise his middle finger when Senku made the suit for his dad but in anime he only make nico nico sign lel
1265,Damn. Looking at the petrification from the space was so intense. Senku's dad was an astronaut who was saved from being stoned. The story has gotten really emotional. Imagine being the last surviving humans on earth.
1266,Byakuya is my favorite anime Dad
1267,"craziest episode of the series, legit they watched everybody turned to stone, imagine the pain and suffering everybody would feel in this moment, it would be the biggest shock of everyone's lives, from the singer to senku's dadespecially senku's dad.    at the same note that means senku is like all the villages great great great great great great great greatmultiple greats later grand father which is interesting, he is literally older then the old man isn't that odd?"
1269,technically he is just not blood related.
1270,"ya, when your guardian isn't related to you we normally call that being adopted..."
1271,Why is everyone assuming there's generations of incest going on. It's not unreasonable to think that other humans broke free naturally and happened to come across the village or that they were found by villagers.
1272,It's really sad now knowing Senku will never see his dad again. The ED is so much more heartfelt now
1273,We are living through the golden age of anime right now
1274,"I like how the launch was 5 years later and wasn't like ""we have to train for the launch in 2 weeks!"""
1275,"Only thing I perceive as odd is the lack of any non stone age technology in Ishigami village, we can assume the astronauts went back soon after the petrification, which would have meant modern society infrastructure still existed. With 6 people you cannot keep realistically any aspect of modern society running but while advanced technology is off the table 6 intellectual and physically fit individuals went to space, A LOT of is needed before you are remotely allowed to go should have been capable of at least preserving a lot of modern data writing, downloading databases, teaching the next generation and overall constructing a good living environment for the first generations with almost all modern luxuries solar and wind power, all tech still exists in working order good quality homes exist everywhere, potentially even semi-automatic food production facilities for long term food production are at their disposal therefore how did they, with access to all of modern society, not manage to produce a self sufficient long lasting environment for modern human survival?     ;    Please note that if this happened the current story would be  non-existent, so why it didn `t is obvious but I `m just wondering if they will acknowledge this in the show or the entire narrative is just ""and thus nothing happened""."
1276,"Modern Technology is built to last centuries, not thousands of years. Even with preservation, you have to account for generation to generation gaps which become less educated.     Theyre astronauts, not manufactures that can reproduce computers to last thousands of years. My hunch is that the 100 stories have something to do with technology that Senku can utilise or find hidden in the village."
1277,     A few centuries? More like a few years without maintenance. Stuff breaks all the time and spare parts  would  eventually run out.
1278,"There are some things built to last centuries. Servers and databases, likewise the nuclear waste storage facility in Norway that's apparently meant to last thousands of years"
1279,Servers and databases aren't meant to last even a fraction of that time without maintenance and a waste storage facility is by its very nature a vault that doesn't do anything. Hardly an example to make a counter argument.
1280,Theres also the argument of animals starting to get curious and moving their territory to where humans use to be in search of food. Think of all the species we have kept in check and how they'd quickly overpopulate
1281,     The people that started the village knew how to read and write and had access to all the libraries in the world. Those books would have lasted a few hundred years if stored well so they had a few generations to learn from them. Making paper and ink isn't that hard so they could have started writing their own books. They obviously couldn't maintain a modern technological civilization but they should at least be reasonably well educated. Something major must have happened after the green light to explain why these people don't even have basic literacy.
1282,Their stone spears are pretty much stone age technology
1283,can we just wait for the next episode without literally losing our shit over plot holes? I don't see any relevant reply I can give that is not going to get deleted by mods.
1284,"These will be further explained, just wait for a bit"
1285,Ishigami is also not near anything resembling past civilization. Senku had to travel pretty far from the starting point to get there.
1286,"So after 3,000 years the village is still that small, how? The village would be at least a large town by then, and how is their tech so terrible if it was founded by astronauts. I wouldn’t expect them to be capable of what Senku is doing, but they should be plenty knowledgeable to give the settlement a serious head start, which would lead to even faster population growth due to better technology, which would lead to an absolute shitload of humans after 3000 years. I hope the next few episodes explain some shit because this is upsetting me far more then it should.    Edit: I might be an idiot, all it would take is a natural disaster which in japan you can kinda just pick your poison to finish resetting humanity. And that’s just the simple answer I’m sure something more interesting happened"
1287,"The very small size of the village is probably connected to its very low level tech. Did the original 6 which are  way  too few for stable descendants after 3700 years by the way manage to crack the unpetrification recipe but ended up with a Tsukasa-like situation on their hands or even a small scale civil war, so they decided to keep things small and simple?    There must be a reason they decided to keep the ""common"" people largely in the dark and pass knowledge through the 100 Tales method only from priestess to priestess. Somehow intermingling genetically with the petrified people, perhaps occasionally, would make much more sense than bizarrely claim that the people of this tiny village are all perfectly fine after 3700 years of interbreeding, which is 10 billion % impossible."
1288,     This could be a case of wanting to avoid information contamination. The more people a story is told to the more it is changed.    One person learning a story their whole life is more likely to retain the original message. Keeping it that way keeps the story from changing assuming you can keep the line unbroken.    Even writing has issues keeping a story consistent because interpretation of written word changes over time.    It could also be a case of unintended ritual forming. A parent passing down stories to their child so they know their history eventually becoming a system of sotries passed from priestess to priestess without such a system being the intention.
1289,"Idk much about genetics, but would the interbreeding be that bad? The closest anyone would have to get to incest is cousins, which while I understand isn’t ideal it’s still not the worst. So I feel like as time goes on people would get more genetically diverse, but I guess it’s possible that as time goes on the little original genetic content would become more and more scrambled until humans are all genetically fucked mutants."
1290,"     Yes because it wouldn't be just a single event, it would be the whole population backed up by that inbreeding.     A single couple of cousins having children is no big deal. But now, have their children marrying their couples, and their grandchildren, so goes on. You got a big problem."
1291,"Except that's what's been happening in northern Europe for 2000 years and look, no issues."
1292,"Northern Europe was never reduced to three breeding couples, not even in Iceland. That's the problem here - you're starting with an awfully small genetic stock, F3 will be already inbred, F4 will be inbreeding between inbred x inbred.    I've done the math for coefficient of relationship  ; PxP astronauts is 0, F1xF1 children is 0, F2xF2 grandchildren is already 12.5% cousins, F3xF3 is on best hypothesis 9.4% triple second cousins, F4xF4 is still 5.5% a bit less than double second cousins.  Eventually  as the population grows and generations go by the inbreeding rate is lower, F3-F6 is really fucked up. If any of those astronauts had a single deleterious allele the odds it pops up in some of their descendants is fairly high.       Formula is here if you want."
1297,Great soundtrack! My best scene of the episode: 
1298,I like how everyone on the ISS speaks perfect Japanese
1299,It most likely is anime rules and they all are speaking English.
1300,Would you seriously prefer the Japanese VAs to speak in cringy broken English for the next few episodes?
1301,"""I am mad scientist. IS SO COOL!"""
1302,Haha no I just thought it was funny. Especially because the song was English
1303,"Since Rui revealed she knew Senku a few episodes ago i knew the outcome would be something like this, but it still breaks my fucking heart. Ugh i’m already crying now, i have a feeling next episode will be worse"
1304,What about people in the undergrounds  subways?
1305,"The petrification ray penetrates through everything, the ISS was unaffected due to it's huge distance from the surface."
1306,i always thought kohaku looked inbred lmao
1307,"They were a Japanese, two Americans, two Russians, and one unknown. You're probably way more inbred than their children could possibly be."
1308,Looking forward to the next episode!
1309,Papa Senku is best dad
1310,Is that Leorio's VA from HxH 2011 for Senku's Dad ?
1311,Yes but you do know that google exists right?
1312,Byakuya immediately springing into action to save humanity. What a bro
1313,"One of the most unbelievable things about this anime was why Senku, the one person who could revive everyone else, JUST SO HAPPENED to be unpetrified first.     With this, it seems likely that he was purposely moved to the cave by his father as a last ditch effort that maybe it would help him wake up."
1314,But what if he wasn't the first?
1315,"Question. I know there was an anime last season about a bunch of kids in space. It wasn't on my watch list. But for anyone who did watch it, I ask.    ""Which space exploration team do you like more?"""
1316,"Senku's hair  as a child  reminds me of celery sticks... or bok choy    This was a light and refreshing episode hehe    But also holy shit seeing the Earth change like that gave me chills, this is v interesting knowing that there were people out in space who witnessed that"
1317,"Okay, I've adored the anime so far, but this really bugs me. 3700 years is way too long for this story to work. There shouldn't be just this little, primitive village. 3700 years is a huge timeframe. This feels more like 100 years or so."
1318,just wait for next episode first
1319,"Not a manga reader so this is pure speculation, but remember that the 3700 number comes from Senku counting seconds while petrified. There is no guarantee that it's even close to correct."
1320,"Nearly all traces of human society have been completely swallowed up by nature, though, so it had to have been quite a long time.  If the time frame had only been centuries, then the crumbling ruins of our cities would still be fairly recognizable."
1321,"Senku is a God in that village xD an ancient relic..    So inbreeding will work, if it was just the original 6?"
1322,"Byakuya meand midnight sun like that Attack on Titan episode, kinda interesting name, does anyone knows if it signifies something else in japanese culture? I found out White awe but that doesn't tell me much.    Only other notable character with that name I know was Byakuya Rinne from Euphoria so that's kinda funny oh and there was apparently someone with that name in Bleach, didn't watch that one"
1323,Papa Ishigami is my new favourite character in this show. He’s so damn likeable.
1324,Could anyone tell me what percentage of the way through the manga the anime is?  Or is the manga still in progress?
1325,"The manga is still ongoing. This episode covered chapter  43, the latest manga chapter is  126."
1326,43106 chapters animated based on chapter titles. Manga looks to still be going.     disclaimer: haven't read any of the manga
1327,"So assuming the astronaut team didn't somehow cryo-freeze themselves, 3,700 years should have passed since they landed on earth right? Even with just a small colony, how did technology  barely  advance over that long of a time period? I'm guessing the next episode will go into that though, so I'm very excited for next week."
1328,None of these people are doctors or survivalists. That should answer some questions without getting into spoiler territory.
1329,"Senku you cant just steal stuff from class, hides beakers I use for paint.    I guess it makes sense that not much science and stuff would remain even tho we have 5 scientists in start. No guarantees they know to much about other fields of study or survival.     Brings ramen and hot singers together in space. God gets scared."
1330,I wonder if they will explain why they couldn't work out how to un-petrify people like Senku did.
1331,Senku used up all his luck respawning near the Bat cave
1332,I wonder if 6 people is enough for a sustainable gene pool. The first few generations would have been interesting.
1333,It isn't. 100 is.
1334,"I wonder how Senku feels, knowing now that he’ll never see his father again. I mean, not that he’ll show it too much on his face, but I imagine that he’d get at least kinda down over that."
1335,If anything I think he would just be proud knowing how Senku is
1336,kinda surprised they never figured out how to depetrify people.  Pretty much all the infrastructure was intact even without numbers they pretty much had access to all of these pre made chemicals.
1337,"Well we were told a major component of the unpetrification was time, The one thing they didn't have access to."
1338,The headphones do nothing.
1339,"I really really liked this episode, but it makes me pretty dang sad"
1340,Great episode! Better than what we've been getting the last couple weeks.
1341,"Ah shit, I suspected last week that the original tribe's founders included Senku's parents, sad to see it happen I feel really bad for him."
1342,So Senku is Kohaku & Ruri's distant ancestor? I'm not gonna lie. I genuinely did not see that coming
1343,He is technically not their ancestor but an extremely distant uncle of them and probably everyone else in the village.
1344,So he's basically Giorno to the rest of the Joestars?
1345,Yes. Senku is Omega-Giorno.
1346,Epic episode
1347,"The episode was pretty cool, but there's a huge concern: If Ishigami village started out with a population of 6 science-minded individuals and now has a population of 40 superstitious tribals after over 3.700 years, where the fuck did they go wrong? They ought to be a massive civilisation by now."
1348,"3700 years with no resources would do that to you, yeah."
1350,"Of course there must have been massive setbacks, but if your civilisation manages to survive 3.700 years, it doesn't seem plausible for it to be such a small village. That's not a society that would last so long, it would have already failed at one point. Well, I don't know the history, maybe the village did fail and was re-established several times, maybe this is just a splinter group from the original Ishigami village, maybe the only connection is the culture stemming from the hundred tales, with no genetic link to the 6 astronauts, their original civilisation already being extinct."
1351,Surely 6 people wouldn't be enough for a stable population? Are Kohaku and the gang inbred as hell?
1352,"Yes, but that's just the way things work after the apocalypse. It's not something that gets brought up, however you can draw your own conclusions. I mean, just look at Mantle for example. Survival of the fittest, natural selection and all that grim stuff."
1353,I think someone did the math and you would only need about 100 people to slowly start repopulation. Six is definitely not enough but even then the number is astonishingly low.
1354,"It wouldn't be a super  healthy  starter population, but over time it would hopefully work out. I imagine there were a  lot  of birth defects over the millennia.     On the other hand, all three are from around the world, so they would have more genetic diversity than, say, six Japanese people, and they were all astronauts, so they would be above average fitness, and also, space radiation, so maybe more mutations?"
1355,Mom and Dad save civilization
1356,Did not know where to find them
1357,"So Ishigami village is over 3000 years old, founded by scientists, but has somehow lost all memory and record of science and has made little to no scientific progress in that time. But they know who Senku is perfectly, no name or story distortions. How the hell did they manage that and how was incest not a bigger problem than it seems to be?"
1358,Mankind is surprisingly or unsurprisingly sturdy to lack of genetic diversity.
1359,wasnt expecting that info dump. omfg that was insane!
1360,What happened to Dalia's face
1361,The Ishigami twist is one of my favorite twists in any animemanga
1362,"Wow, so the village was founded by people who  never  petrified. That’s crazy. I really thought it was just founded by people who woke up a couple hundred years earlier. But this raises a couple questions:    1 If the village was founded by a bunch of astronauts, why do they have no technology to speak of?    And    2 If the village has been around for 3,000 years, why is the population still so small. Seriously, there should be like a million people at this point lol."
1363,"Just in terms of science, if we assume that they stayed primitive the entire time ie never established proper agriculture, and starting from a base population of 6, it probably would have taken a long time to build a massive population. There are theories that 70,000 years ago there were ""only"" as few as  5,000 humans, and that 50,000 years later there were only a few million, but starting at only 6, and considering how hard they would need to work to keep people fed which would limit total population size, and illnesses, and genetic flaws from such a small starting point, it could take a while to get going."
1364,"Yeah, I guess the lack of agriculture really screwed them over. Though it's kinda weird that they are a stationary village and not nomadic given the lack of agriculture."
1365,"Maybe that's part of the rules, and maybe that held them back a bit."
1368,Let us not forget that that there was a music video recorded on the ISS.    I'm betting this is where some inspiration was drawn from.
1369,Now I want to know the other stories
1370,"They're Japanese folklore. Momotaro was noted as one of them, so it's safe to assume Byakuya passed down every single tall tale and myth he knew."
1371,Ohhh ok. Thanks
1372,How do you rate the episode from 1-10?
1373,I did think earlier that there must have been people in space when the green flash happened. It’s like the story of that Soviet astronaut who became stateless while in space and they had trouble figuring out what to do with him. But now I’m wondering how do they get back to earth? Doesn’t that require another Soyuz capsule and lots of help from mission control?    And that got me thinking about what happened to all the nuclear power plants around the world when everyone froze? I guess maybe the authors figured 3700 years is enough time to get rid of all the nuclear fallout.
1374,Most plants automatically shut down if unattended. Some backwoods plants went nuclear. There were bound to be radioactive zones.
1375,"They shut down, yeah. But there’s still radioactive stuff in them. Eventually, something bad could happen. They’re only supposed to shut down for a short period of time so the engineers can fix the problem. Plus there’s the fallout carried by the wind and ocean currents.     And then there’s the nuclear stockpiles.     Has anyone asked Inagaki-sensei about this? Or is it like a Rumiko Takahashi situation where he’s like “I don’t think about that and neither should you.”"
1376,"Both, no one asked and he said in an interview he won't go into details on the grim parts of survival in the story."
1377,"But now with this latest episode, that means that the astronauts would have been exposed to radiation from if not Fukushima Daiichi then some of the other plants in Japan. So it’s still relevant. He can’t just ignore it."
1378,The Chernobyl accident and widespread radiation happened due to it being on fire for days. Most plants in their vicinity would simply turn off.
1379,A flood was shown in episode 1. Fukushima was caused by a tsunami.
1380,There is no mention when said flood happened. 3700 year timeskip is no joke. As for the astronauts. Wait a week.
1381,     There's radioactive stuff in literally anything.
1382,"Fine, let me put it this way. There’s still  nuclear waste  in them."
1383,"Which isn't a real issue, globally."
1384,Of course not. But nobody has to worry about a sudden mass extinction.
1385,"If Senku didnt divorce with the priestess, he could have married his descendants."
1386,"Well, Kohaku is still available, so marrying just one descendant would do."
1387,"Holly shit, that was so good! I had made some faulty theories as to how there could be a village even though everyone had turned into stone, but this wrapped things up so well!"
1388,"I’m gonna be honest, his dad looks different than what I expected, I thought he was more built and blonde"
1389,"Damn my thoughts on Senku's dad being the founder was right, tragically. Man I  love this show. But it means the village is like 3000 years old. I guess there are more people that break through the petrification much earlier than Senku probably."
1390,"Uh oh. I see this going in the way of Senku and Kohaku being related. Is this incestship?     I would have said that it makes sense that inbreeding is why Ruri and Kohaku are poster girls for uncanny valley, but that blonde astronaut girl is no looker either."
1391,"If you go back to relatives 3000 years ago, you are related to almost every human on Earth. At the very least every European would be related to every other European, and everyone else would at least be related to everyone in a 1,000km radius. your parents were almost certainly closer relations than Senku is to anyone in the village."
1392,"This is particularly true for Europe, China and Japan, where family marriage wasn't only allowed but actively encouraged."
1393,it only takes a few generations to have DNA so vastly different that its not really incest. thats why its legal to marry a second cousin but not a first.
1394,"Now, if humanity was restarted by a group of 6 scientist, why the hell didn't they have more advanced technology?, I mean, they had several decades after founding the village to teach and write down everything they knew and try to rebuild as much technology as possible"
1395,Wait until next week.
1396,"Calling it now: Senku's dad put him in the cave. Just to protect him from weather and stuff, but it actually ended up being the key to his, and consequently, the rest of humanity's, resurrection"
1397,Was that just lillians dub seiyuu who sang?
1398,"They got an English singer, she's listed in the ED."
1399,"Ah, Ardyn Izunia had revenge on humanity clearly."
1400,"soooo....if those 6 were all alive from the start, how did literally all technology disappear?"
1401,This was a reeaally good episode. I got chills at the end.
1402,"Boichi and Inagaki flexed on Attack on Titan's Isayama by going with To You, 3000 years from now"
1403,"6 astronauts found a village. 3000 years go by, village is a flint fucking tools level."
1404,"So, they avoided the petrification and became the last six humans alive atleast according to this episode, who knows they could possibly reveal more people like this all over the world            And then we have this current village which is most likely founded by these six survivers, so I can't stop imagining that chrome is like brother to senku really down that family tree, who inherited the byakuya's science nerd genes like senku.            And now banded together with him, are going to realise byakuya's dream of helping humanitywhich he apparently couldn't accomplish in his time, so it's kinda like senku is meeting with the reincarnation of his dad"
1405,I still can't get over the fact the girls look like fucking flounders in this show.
1406,They are all inbred x300
1407,"Do we ever find out what caused this event, I don't want to know the details just if it's still a mystery."
1408,Yes
1409,What a strange episode. I found the singing bits in the middle to be quite uninteresting
1410,When i first égard father's VA i scream instantly    ACDC!!!
1411,"What did Senku mean that KohakuRuri had a foreign look?  Is it the Clannad eyes?  But I’m guessing it’s them being descendants of the singer. Did the astronauts find other unaffected people, or made some?"
1412,"I fucking love senku's dad, he goes out and sells his car and presumably spends a heap of money just so senku could have science instruments and materials to research and follow his dream. Extra extra extra wholesome"
1413,what's with that russian? ladys mouth lmao
1414,Lillians ass was fat Af when she was singing on the island
1415,"Great episode and all, just wanted to explain something I've been seeing down in the comments. Senku is not the Astronauts biological son. He is clearly adopted, which can be inferred from the disastrously different hair, and the fact that in all of 'em flashback scenes we never get to see Senku's mom. It might even have been explicitly mentioned at some point.      ;    And therefore... it ain't incest!"
1416,Why were Byakuya's eyes always hidden until now? Anyways he's so sweet. How much he talks about his son!!! Aawwww.
1417,"3.700 years, and only 40 people in this village ???????"
1418,"I haven't seen anyone else talk about it on this thread, so I thought I would be the first to point it out.    I'm pretty sure that Lillian is a direct reference to the time when Sarah Brightman.    I assume most people reading this probably have no idea who she is. TL;DR, she's a pretty well known singer but not so much in today's world. There's also a good chance, even if you don't remember, you've probably have heard these songs at least once, especially between 1987 and early to mid 2000's.      Time To Say Goodbye    Phantom of The Opera    Time To Say Goodbye is also played at Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas.    She even did a duet.    Sarah is pretty famous all around the world, but more importantly, and for this topic, Japan too.    There's so many parallels with Sarah and Lillian that I'll list here:    1. They're both singers.  2. Both spent 50 million dollars to go to space.  3. Both wanted to sing in space as a performance. Sarah was planning on having a performance from space  4. They've both had the title ""Diva"" in front of their name at some point. Sarah has an album called ""Diva"" and has been referred to as a Diva a lot in the past, although she's far from a Diva    Anyway just thought I'd point that out even knowing not many people will care. As a big Sarah Brightman fan it was nice to see a reference of her in an anime, which is the last thing I would expect.    Thanks for reading, have a nice day!   "
1419,"Damn, well that's a lot of ships sunk for those of us who aren't into incest.     ""I'm guessing byakuya dies or something considering no-one in the village has white hair."""
1420,The tournament referee.
1421,"      ""Senku isn't biologically related to Byakuya. He's adopted."""
1422," ""Even when there's 3k years apart Senku and Kohaku, they still need the 'not blood related' wincest save """
1423,"Well, they know the biology knowledge of most folks isn't exactly great."
1424,You better not marry... ever. Scientists are pretty much certain humans all descend from 2 or 3 people between 100k and 300k years old.
1425,"I don't know where you heard that man, but the humanity dip brought the population to  1000, not 2-3.    But yes, we probably have dna descended from all of those humans and the idea of calling ""Incest"" intercourse between someone and his descendants by hundreds of generations is a bit ridiculous."
1426,Look up matrilineal and patrilineal most recent ancestors often 'clickbaitfied' to genetic Adam and Eve.
1427,"We are more or less talking about the same thing. The most recent common ancestor MRCA refers to the most recent individual in the past who is an ancestor to all members of a current group. This is mainly used to refer to the date when these ancestors existed to determinate the genetic diversity in a species. A closer date would imply that members of a species genetically resemble each other a lot and the opposite is true for a later date.        This does not mean there was at some point a single man and woman had to repopulate the earth. In fact the female MRCA and male MRCA nicknamed ""mitochondrial eve"" and ""y-chromosomal adam"" most likely lived hundreds of thousands of years apart.        This is related to the subject of extinction because when the human population was drastically reduced a 100k years or so back, the population being smaller necessarily had a closer MRCA. And by the properties of time and genetics our current MRCA must be either that one or a relatively close descendant of it. Without the ""genetic bottleneck"" that was the extinction, our MRCA would be from our time as apes."
1428,If astronauts repopulated earth then why didn’t they figure out medicine and other necessities while technology still worked
1429,An industrial civilization requires thousands of people. Anything below 10000 can only maintain an agratian society and there were 6 of them. Do the math.
1430,"Tell me this then? Senku, without any online sources was able to use his knowledge to make everything we’ve seen so far. Why then couldn’t astronauts with access to the whole wealth of human online knowledge make it to at least the point that Senku has developed the city thus far?     Even if servers went down before they could get the appropriate information, they should have been able to go to their agencies and libraries to get the necessary information"
1431,"Because Senku is making shit on demand, not enough to be self-sustaining long term. All of his stuff is highly inefficient and depending upon some very specific goals. If he doesn't fix the problem of 99.9999% of humanity being petrified in his lifetime chances are that all of waht he has acomplished will be lost in a few generations."
1432,Unless he writes it down and teaches others. He has decades to optimize and prepare future generations.      This is the point of masterapprentice skills which have passed down humanities skills and knowledge for generations
1433,Depends entirely on where they landed. Most of earth is unpopulated.
1434,"On his own, he couldn't really produce anything that the village doesn't have episode 5 or so?. The other stuff came once he had more help  and  a secure food supply chain,  and  he'd already had Chrome scouting the area and finding materials to work with.     Plus he's a genius who had memorized, like,  everything.  They were just reasonably brilliant people who only knew their specific fields, and likely didn't know the complex chemistry to actually produce the things they would need."
1435,"I honestly didn't expect for the petrification to be a natural phenomenon and not man-made. Interesting... Wonder how they'll explain it because the show have been consistent with all the scientific stuff and I guess there would be some sci-fi stuff that'll be use to explain it.    Now, to know the reason behind why it happened and what triggers it."
1436,They still haven't specified whether or not the petrification was natural but the assumption is that it was an unintended event. The prevailing theory is nanomachines son.
1437,"OMG FINALLY SOME WORLD BUILDING.    My guess was Senkuu's dad un-petrified early on and started a civilization. However, it turns out he never was petrified at all. Meaning these 6 people will go back to Earth and start that civiliaztion were Senkuu is currently at. I am so glad this is finally being explain.    WAIT, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME SENKUU'S DAD GETS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT SINGER. THAT WOULD MEAN RURI AND KOHAKU ARE DESCENDANTS OF SENKUU'S DAD. MAKING SENKUU AND KOHAKU BE RELATED.    Please let that not be the case. Now the only big storyline that needs answers is why this petrification even happened. This also probably means Senkuu was the first person to un-petrify.    Man, I can't wait to see what happens. Each week it becomes harder and harder to not read the manga."
1438,"Even if everyone in the village in the present day were descended from Senku's dad, it means literally nothing after 100+ generations over 3000 years."
1439,the animu astronaut crew where no one has heard of each other before they board the station.    in hindsight it was actually quite obvious that astronauts currently on a station would survive. is there a way that's build into the station for them to get back without any sort of ground contact? that would really surprise me but would indeed be cool.
1440,"Well, the in-space team wouldn't have met the new team before. They would know who they were, but not met. The new team would have trained together, and they new each other."
1441,If they landed right after the disaster why isn't civilization already rebuilt? It's been over 3000 years and all of the books and technology were still intact following the disaster.      I suppose I'll learn why in the next episode.
1442,"My guess is that they tried everything they could think of but failed to unpetrify anyone. Senku's acid solution worked according to him due to the partial decay of the stone material. So it apparently wouldn't have worked on a freshly petrified person, and I frankly have no idea if any acid would have worked. That is assuming they even tried using acids on them."
1443,Anyone else bugged about the blatant voice change from Lillian? When she sings and speaks it sounds like a completely different voice actor and ok I know u need someone to speak both languages but you coulda found someone who’s not Japanese CAUSE NEITHER IS THE CHARACTER who speaks Japanese and English... It’s a small thing but it bugs me...
1444,"Yeah, it would have been cool if they'd just cast a weeaboo American VA living in Japan, like Diana Garnet or something."
1445,"Or a Japanese with nearly perfect english, like Rie Fu."
1446,Well the character is foreign so the English accent needs to be foreign as well
1447,Rie Fu's accent is Australian.
1448,Well the character is supposed to be English I would assume based of stuff that happens later not really spoilers they just talk about her and America like she’s from there
1449,"I was wondering how they were going to do her songs, and unfortunately my worst case happened"
1450,So that whole village descended from 6 people. No wonder they all look so fucked up
1451,The 6 people on the space station were not too good looking to begin with.
1452,"I was frankly disappointed by this episode. Not so much by the episode itself but due to the predictable but physically and medically impossible events that will follow it. Up until know we've largely seen some pretty solid science from this show. However this episode suggests that these 6 people three couples, one of them already married will somehow manage to end up having genetically stable descendants for no less than  3700 years.     We know that they will fail to unpetrify anyone. Despite having a wide variety of acids at their disposal when they return to Earth apparently none will work. Perhaps due to the freshness of the stone? Or, who knows, the shock and implicit survivor's guilt will turn them utterly stupid and they won't think about trying acids at all. However it plays out we know that they won't be able to ""help"" anyone at all from the 7+ billion petrified people. If they had ""cracked"" the recipe there would be tens to hundreds of thousands ""flesh and bone"" people around just in Japan, not just this tiny village.    Neither did any of their descendants in the future manage to unpetrify anyone. So after 3700 full years everyone in the village is the descendant of these 6 people. Er, that could never,  ever  work. The genetic defects and diseases due to the excessive interbreeding would start in just a couple of centuries, and eventually after 500 - 800 years everyone would have died out. 6 people is not simply a small genetic pool. It is an implausibly tiny one."
1453,There are plenty of remote islands with small gene pools.
1454,"Name one that its original settlers was a group of less than  50 people. And how much time it has been inhabited by the same group of people. Such islands do exist, but interbreeding defects destabilize their population in a few centuries. Here we are talking about 3700 years."
1455,"You are getting too ahead of yourself, this isn't a matter of proving or disproving. Here is the authors answer to the dillema.  TEAM JUMP: How did just six astronauts create a healthy community that could last for 3,700 years without serious problems from inbreedinglack of genetic diversity?  Inagaki Sensei: The basic answer to this is, nobody knows whether this is possible or not. The reason is because nobody has ever tried it. But there are situations where islands were populated with small numbers of people. But nobody knows if it started with four people, or ten people. So if nobody really knows for sure, then the god of the world can decide it. And I’m the god of the world in Dr. STONE."
1456,Provide papers or that's nothing but bullshit.
1457,"Yeah, two seperate indigenous Australian tribes emerging from a 20ky long Ice age 20ky ago had breeding groups of 3-5 males to one shared female. I determined that from their naming conventions. The one that had three breeding malesone female experienced loss of its dominant traits to the one that had five malesone female, but what saved the lesser tribe from extinction was converging with multiple new tribes. A single tribe that did realy well had multiple breeding females and males.   So they could survive for a few thousand years, but spermegg banks would need to be looted."
1458,"Whoa, so does this mean senku is related to some of them then? I can't ship him and kohaku anymore since they may actaully be related? lol"
1459,You can ship them as much as you like.
1460,"Thanks for the encouragement. I realize after though, Senku ain't one to care for my shipping though lol"
1461,After such a long time it's almost guarranteed he's related to the lot of them or none at all.    There insn't enough of an original pool of people for there to reliably be a full lineage over thousands of years that never mixed with his fathers unless his father died without having any children post-pettification.
1462,Thanks for the explanation. Guess we'll find out next week.
1463,"The common ancestor of all humans lived from 2000-4000 years ago.    Being 3700 years apart, Senku and Kohaku are as related to each other as you are to any other human."
1464,"     That's absolutely wrong. The ""mitochondrial Eve"", our closest all-encompassing genetic relative, is at least 100000 years old, 50 times as much as your suggested number."
1465,"That's the matrilineal ancestor, I'm talking in general.    According to Wikipedia, the most recent common ancestor of humans might have lived as recently as 300 B.C.    Source"
1466,"The issue here is that's a purely theoretical model. To quote the authors         Further, although the model gives some insight on how populations  generally  mix over time, it ignores various factors such as racism and purposeful tribal isolation."
1467,"Did this feel too short for anyone else?!      I got a massive case of blue balls when the ED started playing.      Went all:    ""Huh?!"""
1468,Who else is scared that Senku bouta but a but in his great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great niece.
1469,I dont read the manga but I heard this astronaut shit with Senkuu's father is so dumb that the creator basically acts like it never happened. I can see why lol.
1474,"the amount of comments about senku banging his great great greatx x30 grand niece or whatever seriously perturb me. I really, really Really hope the mangaanime doesn't have a romantic subplot between senku and anyone. I feel like it would totally ruin his character."
1475,Senku x Gen
1476,Senku x Gen²
1477,Senku is asexual either way.
1478,If science was a woman he'd fuck her.
1479,Dude. It's been 3000 years. They are 10000000000% genetically dissimilar. Any two people in Iceland are likely to be more genetically similar than Senku and anyone else in this village.
1480,"I mean, what's the difference? It's like feeling bad that you and your wife probably share an ancestor 300 generatiosn ago.     ;    Something like 4% of humanity has Genghis Khan as a common ancestor, that doesn't man they are incestous because they bang."
1481,"My point isn't about incest or whatever, I couldn't care less. It's more about the whole ""romance"" aspect that everyone seems to be rooting for. I feel like a romance with senku, whether it be kohaku or any other character, would just feel weird and forced. He doesn't seem like a character who would fall in love, or feel romantic love.  tldr; I ship senku with science. that's it."
1482,"On that I agree with you. But your first comment  didn't  say that so you may want to add an ""Edit"" explaining your thoughts better."
1485,"So we probably hit the biggest plot hole withing this anime. There's no fucking way 5 top tier scientists excluiding the singing lady  wouldn't find out that nitric acid is the key to saving humanity with most of the technology and resources from Earth still intact, they would probably figure out in time that nitric acid or some derivated from it would un-stone humans. Like Senku said in the first episode, trial and error is the key, and you would think that with the time they got they would find it out  also pointing out that Astronauts are extremely skilled people with lots of pHDs in many scientific areas    PS: There's a weird theory in science that states that like the universe, the Earth might be divided into multiple dimensions, or multiple Earths within the same you see which would explain ghosts and weird stuff people see from time to time and that extreme interactions between these layers could have outerly world effects on our Earth. I think this is might be the case of Dr.Stone plot. You can see a big planet during the World Ending event.    Other likely explanation is that it was deliberate, it's no coincidence that  swallow were petrified shortly before humanity, pointing out that humanity was a deliberate target to the petrification and that whoever was responsible targed the wrong species first and had to recalculate to hit humanity right this time."
1486,"a possible explanation is that the nitric acid wouldnt work during the first few hundred years. since energy has to come from somewhere, senku said that when he was thinking for all those 3000 years, he was probably taking energy in from the stone  weakening it, which is why the bat juice worked on him after a while.     maybe nitric acid only works if the person in question has already weakened the stone a fair bit by thinking enough over the span of hundreds of years? its a bit of a stretch but i think it works as an explanation"
1487,"Senku had an advantage though, he knew where to look since he got naturally unpetrified. That massively narrowed down the things that could actually work.  Also the technology left over wouldn't be that much of a help. Any part that breaks down is impossible to replace unless you scavenge  it from somewhere. So even though the technology is still intact, a lot of their time would still be taken up by maintaining it."
1488,"     Tell me, how  would  they figure it out? Would they just start throwing random chemicals at petrified people and hope something does anything? Senku had a clue thanks to his starting point and he could actually verify it wasn'ta  false lead. Even thne it took him an entire year to find what actually worked. How would the astronauts busy trying to survive in post-apocalyptic Earth do the same?"
1489,heck he needed to wait till taiju who he dragged to the cave woke up
1490,"SO THIS...IS THE POWER...OF SPEEDWATCHING....    Amazing how quickly you managed to forget about the fact that nitric acid cannot be just found in every nook and corner of the world, otherwise Senku would have already won against Tsukasa."
1491,"     In the ""stone world"", however they aren't at that point yet they are still in the ""old"" modern world so they can get their hands on a lot of chemicals if they break in labs or places like that.    But we'll have to wait until next week as the next episode will most likely continue the flashback and explain why they couldn't save everyone back then."
1492," You're forgetting that Nitric Acid was only enough for Taiju after he had spent 3000 years consuming the stone, weakening it further by consuming additional energy from thinking about Yuzuhira on and off. Everyone else needs Nital, and that's still 3000 years after their stone being weakened by sustaining them. Given this, it can easily be assumed that the stone everyone is made of shortly after the event would be too strong for even the strongest acids or etching components to free them."
1494,Also: could you make a boat? Pretty sure if they landed in Japan they would need a boat.
1496,Are you a manga reader? Wanted to have a discussion over the plot hole but this comment will get deleted if I do.
1497,Can always made a manga spoiler post in main
1498,nope now they delete and move it to the source discussion section regardless of spoiler tag used.
1501,"Even if they did find out, where would they get it? Most of the earth is unpopulated as it is and if they happened to land in a barren area as can be somewhat suggested by the location of Ishigami they would be far away from any resources or areas of knowledge. They would have to travel on foot. Across the Japanese archipelago. Which is MOSTLY WATER. None of them know how to make a boat."
1502,"How convenient that Japanese is the official language of the ISS.    They were waaay too steady in zero gravity there.  Like twin-tail - wasn't even moving.  The doctor dude pushed her towards the celeb, and she moved like 1 foot and stopped in place the instant he stopped pushing. SCIENCE FAIL.    Anyway, 3k years of inbreeding is what's required to produce Kohaku and Suika?  Worth it."
1503,"I assumed everyone was speaking English. At least it isn't as confusing as Vinland Saga. And I don't expect Sasuga hair animation on this show, like I would on a show devoted to space, like Astra."
