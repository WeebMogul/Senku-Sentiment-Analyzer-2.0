1,Senku doing a neck crack while talking about the minor damages being mended is some great foreshadowing
2,yeah there are definitely some things that are translating way better in the anime medium. The sound design in particular is really good and makes some scenes like the tsukasa fight in this ep feel better than the manga.
3,It's something that I definitely didn't pick up on in the manga.
4,I'm glad they did that
5,Same. I noticed how they cut out some of the humor elements a couple times in the past two episodes.
6,"Any manga readers care to tell me how long Tsukasa is going to be in the show? Not what happens, just how long he'll be around. I can't help noticing that he's not in the ending animation, which kind of sucks because I find him fun, and I love how his voice actor plays him."
7,"Slight manga spoilers""He'll be around this entire season at least."""
8,"Bigger Manga spoilers""That's not entirely accurate. I mean, he'll be on the show at some level for probably 2-3 cours, but he'll only be in a couple more episodes before he basically vanishes for most of that time, only showing up for a minute or two every few episodes."""
9,Thank you! That's good news for me. :D
10,"I'm writing these reviews episode by episode and as I watch them so I can keep the details fresh in my mind.    I'll using this link for all comparisons I make. I'll be labeling everything with numbers so you can look back between the images and the bullet points.      1 They did the face Senku made justice at the beginning of the episode. It's actually a good place for the episode to start off actually.    2 Then, when Senku is explaining his hypothesis, Taiju's reaction is also given it's justice.    3 I loved Yuzuriha's resurrection. I was looking forward to that. It was better than I thought it would be. This anime has surpassed my expectations for it since Episode 2. I've read the manga, or at least up until Chapter 52 Z=52. I got chills watching that scene. It's one of the most emotional scenes for me and even more emotional in the anime.     4 Yuzuriha seems to look cuter in the anime. I mean, you wouldn't dare tell me otherwise.    Taiju and Senku's fight was more epic. I really liked the flow of animation of when Tsukusa caught the arrow. 5 Just look at the faces when Taiju was yelling at Tsukusa.    Other faces after that are adapted very well.    When they found the Buddha statue, they did it better than the manga.    I love the music. It's so suiting and well composed.    I love this show and this is the best episode already. I can't wait to see how they adapt it next."
11,"Can we all agree that the majority of the characters in the show don't get a lot of character development? Like, I love the manga but that's kinda a detriment to the show I believe. Like, the characters with the most development are Senku, Tsukasa and I guess Ginro or Sukia? I don't really know. That's always been the hardest part with the manga."
12,Also Chrome.
13,"Oh yea, I forgot Chrome does have some too. But besides those five, none of the others really get any development unless Kinro getting glasses getting development counts."
14,"I noticed that too, but the manga did so well keeping me occupied with all the science-y stuff that I forgot about it immediately. I don't think Dr. Stone really need much character development, at least not yet."
15,"Yeah, but it will have to eventually especially with Kohaku. Poor girl hasn't really gotten to do much besides fighting."
16,She's been doing some fun stuff this arc.
17,"That's because not all the characters in the manga need any development, their flaws are already minor and they don't impede progress. So far, all the character who get serious development are ones already heavily flawed, e.g. Manga characters""Tsukasa, Ginro, Magma"", however their changes aren't drastic, but more in inline with their character."
18,Heavy character development isn't always a good or necessary thing in storytelling and I wish people would stop making this basic mistake.
19,"I know that and I do love reading this manga, it's just something I noticed when reading it. It's not making me stop reading it though."
20,"It would be pretty detrimental to the core concepts of the series, we might see some minor changes in characters like Chrome, but there shouldn't be too much focus on elements like that."
21,"In general they are pretty shallow, but they play on each other so well I don't particularly care for the depth."
22,"Yeah, agreed. That's the only thing that keeping this series from being amazing for me, I do really enjoy it still.    Character design is good too, makes me want to know more. So I wish we dived deeper into characters, even main squad is not that fleshed out."
23,"More like ``How much of a shonen protagonist you can be? Besides, i'm the protagonist´´  I was resisting the urge to say anything about Yuzuriha to those thinking she was going to be revived at the very end of the series, was kinda funny."
24,"They literally told us they already have the means to revive her. How   could   you even drag it out anymore, let alone to the end of the series"
25,Never underestimate anime's power for dragging things out.
26,This planet will explode in 5 minutes
27,"apparently the planet left for a trip because it felt like it was weighing down all the solar system planets, and the sun spent another 100 chapters finding it, all compressed to 2 mins. even dio acknowledged the sun's power."
28,Not to mention we need at least 5 eps for the planet to go through a training arc and tournament arc to prepare ourselves for the OVA and possibility of a third season so that we can find out what happens in the manga.
29,Only for the mangaka to fall ill and go on and off of hiatus for 15 years.
30,"... 20 episodes later, the planet will explode in 4 minutes.    DBZ flashback time."
31,I can stop time for exactly 5 seconds
32,Talking is a free action
33,As is posing.
34,WRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYY
35,  Chimera ant arc flashbacks  
36,Nisekoi would like to know your location
37, Next time on Dragonball Z... 
38," Right before reviving Yuzuriha    ""Sorry Yuzuriha, but you'll have to wait a little longer. Right now we need somebody who can ride a unicycle while juggling in order to survive this very unique situation"""
39,"""Do you guys have a unicycle?""    ""Of course, that was the third thing I made!"""
40,Lmao this happened like once or twice and it's already a meme way out of control.
41,"Simple. You just add characters that look like better candidates for unpetrification at the moment of time.     We COULD unpetrify Yuzuriha, we could... But we also could unpetrify mr. Saitama instead and have him defend us.    That would also lead to pointless drama between the characters, which would also serve to prolong the series."
42,"It's not even a hard sell really. It takes a long time to collect enough fluid to revive a single person, and Yuzuriha is just a normal schoolgirl with no particular special skills or abilities that we know of. There are countless people who would be more useful in getting established and keeping things going than her. Builders, soldiers, hunters, fishers, farmers, engineers, doctors. Looking at it rationally, Yuzuriha should be pretty low priority all things considered; she was perfectly safe wrapped up in her tree and could have easily waited until they had a bit more of a firm standing. Senku's just too much of a softie for that I guess."
43,"Well, they also have to move, and good luck finding her again once you lose track of the exact location... they walked 80 km just this episode."
44,Also he needs to keep Big Oaf happy or he has to do all the lifting again.
45,Big Oaf would carry her with them
46,"Carrying her in stone form is super dangerous, she could break, and it would mean less room for vital supplies. Remember Senku already wanted to revive her, naked as she was, right where they found it exactly for this reason."
47,"I mean, making your brute force guy happy does seem like a good reason to me."
48,As a manga reader I wanna say soooo much    But trust me it's not you average shounen it's way more then that    Just keep watching and you will love it
50,"    Spoiler source""Spoiler goes here""    You should edit your comment before it gets removed."
51,Yeah but imagine if that person you just described was a family member I don’t know about you but no matter how useless they would be in the situation and revive them.
52,Just confused by what you mean by “prolong the series” We already know the number of episodes in the season. Unless you mean that they would be trying to drag it out to a second season.
53,The manga isn't finished. They wouldn't drag something out for the anime. If its dragged out in the manga it will be in the anime.
54,The big oaf could come up with an excuse each time they try to revive her. Like how he didn't want to revive her the first time because she would be naked. Yes I called him the big oaf because I forgot his name
55,It's okay I'm caught up on the manga and I still forget his name.
56,"Taiju, it rhymes with Kaiju"
57,They claim they have limited destoning stuff. They just keep running into shit that requires them to prioritize other people like in episode 2.
58,via bullshit. Those familiar with shounen anime are well acquainted with it.
59,"It'd be easy.    Episode 3: The fight with Tsukasa ends with the destruction of the batcave, and there is no available source of nitric acid. Tsukasa calmly leaves to go murdering, while Senku and Taiju go to the hot springs.    Episode 4: Senku obtains gunpowder from the hot springs, while Taiju hunts for food in the area so they can make it back home. The episode ends with Senku finally crafting the best weapon of science; the gun.    Episode 5: Senku and Taiju decide to start heading back to their homes, but then more Lions appear, as they are at the top of the food chain in this new stone world. Tsukasa jumps from behind them, kills the Lions, and begins still sharing his philosophy as the ED plays.    Episode 6: Senku pulls out his gun, fires it at Tsukasa, and Tsukasa goes down... for a brief moment. Realizing that there is no hope in finishing off Tsukasa without a reliable source of bullets for his gun, Senku grabs Taiju and they book it out of town to go figure this problem out. Another person is found to have awoken in the stone world.    Episode 7: Senku and Taiju talk with the person who had just woke up, and they find out he has catatonic schizophrenia. This leads him to act like he is petrified by stone anyways, much to Senku's amusement, and Taiju's confusion. Senku finds a source of mercury, and he's just like ""OI, TAIJU, YOU BIG OAF, IF WE CAN GET SOME NITRIC ACID SOMEWHERE ELSE WE CAN DISSOLVE MERCURY IN IT THEN ADD ETHANOL TO GET MERCURY FULMINATE"" so he could go get ammo. Taiju realizes that he can't wake up Yuzuriha anyways if Tsukasa's around, so he waits for it to be safe, as he refuses to leave her unprotected.    Episode 8: Senku has solved the problem of a lack of ammunition, but needs a new place to obtain nitric acid. Conveniently, they find one a fair amount of minutes away from their original base. Taiju collects a ton of nitric acid, and Senku discovers they are being watched. Tsukasa shows up, and there they go, running away once more. They find the catatonic schizophrenic, who is revealed to be more powerful in combat than Tsukasa ever was. The catatonic schizophrenic yeets Tsukasa, and their battle begins.    Episode 9: The battle finishes, ending in Tsukasa's death, and Taiju starting to wonder if he is a bad person for letting someone die. Taiju starts crying, and remembers how he managed to get to this point. Cue recap episode.    Episode 10: Taiju makes some revival fluid with the help of Senku, however Senku has something else in mind. ""OI, YA BIG OAF, WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT FLUID HAS ANY SIDE EFFECTS YET. TSUKASA'S PASSED AWAY AND WE HAVEN'T WOKEN UP ANYONE ELSE. I THINK YOU WANNA BE TEN BILLION PERCENT CERTAIN YOU CAN REVIVE YUZURIHA SAFELY BEFORE YOU DO THAT!"" They decide to revive someone else, and then the catatonic man shows up to join the party. The episode ends with the new person's stone shell cracking.    Episode 11: Senku, Taiju, the catatonic man, and another guy they had just awoken are now together. ""OI, YA BIG OAF, WE NEED A TEN BILLION PERCENT BETTER HOME IF YOU'RE GOING TO BRING YUZURIHA INTO THIS."" Senku decides to slack off while Taiju builds the new house, while the catatonic man and the recently awoken man decide that they want to live on their own together. The other two leave, and then Senku/Taiju decide it's finally time.    Episode 12: They finally revive Yuzuriha, except they find out that the fluid only works on reviving males, not females. Together, Senku and Taiju prepare for a whole nother season of stretching out this plot line."
60,I feel a strong urge to hit something after reading this.
61," hit something     Breaks Yuzuriha's statue     OI, BIG OAF, WE HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER TEN BILLION SEASONS TRYING TO FIX THE STATUE NOW"
62, fuak 
63," How could you even drag it out anymore, let alone to the end of the series    Tsukasa kidnapping her petrified body as a hostage would be the most logical way I think. Glad that didn't happen though."
64,"Well the OP only showed her in rock form and showed all those other characters having been revived, it was a logical conclusion to come to."
65,I was expecting Tsukasa to kidnap her and then for there to be some terrible love triangle.
66,"I assumed it just wouldn't work on girls for some reason, or just specifically her"
67,"They had the means.        But if you ask me this, I could give you a simple and reasonable answer.        Tsukasa could have learned about her and made her a hostage and hide her somewhere while still petrified, just to guarantee that Senku wouldn't fuck his plans that because Taiju would beg him for so or anything like that.        If you think a little bit, you can imagine dozens of scenarios were it could happen. Demands some imagination, though."
68,"Since she doesn't show up revived in the OP, I was sure something was going to go wrong, and she would probably end up dead. I'm so relieved now."
69,I thought we might not because of her not being very prevalent in the opening. Maybe I'm just not really noticing her though.
70,Expected Tsukasa to destroy the revival medicine before they could revive her. Glad they didn't drag it out though.
71,"tbf, the OP kinda gave vibes, that indicated her staying in stone for a while."
72,"Now that you mention it, it's true. From the persepctive of an anime only it does seem that way."
73,"That was the only reason I was ""shocked"" she got revived. I expected it quickly but I was bamboozled into a bit of doubt from the OP. Hopefully the show keeps up with logical decisions."
74,The anime OP is too smart I got boomed.
75,"That would be a pretty weak end, personally. Not saying I don't like her, it's just her personality isn't much so far besides that she's nice."
76,Well we did just get introduced to her
77,I was pretty relieved when she got revived - my internal trope-o-meter was expecting it to drag out and I was not looking forward to it. Feeling optimistic about this show now.
78,"  I was resisting the urge to say anything about Yuzuriha to those thinking she was going to be revived at the very end of the series, was kinda funny.      Well good to know you were able to hold back and not be a source spoileing jerk face like some people on this subreddit.       chitogheh"
79,"Well, she was on one of the promotional visuals so I assumed it would only take a few episodes for them to revive her."
80,I got spoiled from a thumbnail from a certain anime streaming site lol
81,"  ` `How much of a shonen protagonist you can be? Besides, i'm the protagonist´´     ;    I was thinking of that exact image"
82,"Very minor but it was something that bothered me, I'm really glad Senku actually explained whats with those ""cracks"" on their faces.    I initially thought it was some design choice or something."
83,"  I initially thought it was some design choice or something.    i mean it is that too, but yeah i thought the same."
84,Lord of the Flies 2.0
85,"I would like to point out that, maybe, they get some resistance too after being revived? I mean there's no way Taiju survived that kick or even broke his arm after that just because he's fit;strong alone. I think it's a way to nerf Tsukasa in future fights. Just my guess"
86,They just have superpowers.    Senku has super-intellect  Taiju has super-endurance    And Tsukasu has super-strength
87,I thought it was pretty clear as an aftereffect of the petrification.       whowouldathunkit
88,"Well, obviously that's what it is; they didn't have it before petrification, and now they do. I think most people were confused about  what exactly  those lines were. I sure as hell wasn't thinking literal cracks in their face."
89,"I thought they were cracks myself.  Just seemed like it.  And with them being around the softer more moving parts of the body, it seemed logical for the affliction.  Most are on the face or bendy parts like chest or such.  George and Tarzan both have them on thier chests, and ide guess Moe-chan's are on her shoulders and back probably as the lines can be seen going under her dress."
90,Yuzuriha has some on her arm
91,"With where those are, makes sense. She had flora growing around her for thousands of years, it looks like a tree root had imbedded itself at some point into her arms but not enough to break them."
92,"When they showed the flashbacks of yuzuriha, I was like 'I wonder if they'll make your face ugly with cracks'   Then I realized that she's the   female love interest"
93,It was made really evident with how the cracks on Tsukasa's face matched with how his shell cracked.
94,Didnt George's also do that too? Cant recall.
95,"I really appreciated them explaining that, although some of the cracks, like Yuzuriha's spirals, still don't make sense."
96,Hers are probably due to how the branches of the tree grew on her.
97,"That makes a lot of sense, thanks!"
98,"Yeah, but still they are design choices. All the scientific explanations are quite  bullshit , but at least there are some."
99,When they break out of their stone the cracks that form to break the stone matches the patterns on their bodies. I noticed this first with tsukasa because of the way the cracks spiraled down his face/body; leaving marks that matched.     I have a theory. potential spoilers“all stone people have cracks but there are some in the op that don’t have any. They may not be from the same era as the stone people.”
100,I never even considered why they were a thing.
101,I thought it was stylistic hair. Kinda hard not to chalkheh up any design oddities to weird hair style choices when the main character is sprouting onions on his head.
102,Didn't understand it myself would you be able to explain what he said?
103,"well, it's more like that craks or fissures its what was left of the damage that they had when they were stone, as senku says the stone was a kind of biological coating, so when they were revived, the body itself and the stone tried to fill the spaces.      ;    but thats just my teory."
104,Man the art in this anime is really amazing and faithful to the manga.
105,The art is the main thing about this show and manga that is consistently awesome. There are 0 times where I think Bochi's not working  at least 10 billion percent. Dude's awesome.
106,  Bochi     B-Bocchi? 
107,Who?
108,"The drawings of minor spoiler""scientific equipment and mechanical devices"" later are drop-dead gorgeous. They sold me on the manga."
109,"My favourite splash pages are probably manga spoilers"" the incredibly detailed sunflower field when Suika gets her glasses and Lady Sulphuric Acid""."
110,I really should get a wallpaper of that. She's my favorite supporting character.
111,"IIRC, he majored in physics rather than art so he would be able to draw sci-fi scenes accurately."
112,Every chapter of Origin and Dr. Stone is a blessing to the art world.
113,"The art is amazing, the only problem I have with it is how women are designed."
114,  only problem I have with it is how women are designed    This is generally the case with Boichi's art.
115,"Yea, I noticed that Yuzuriha has some real weird  facial structure at times..."
116,The strange part is there's another female character later that has a normal design like the guys do despite all the others having those weird doe eyes. It's odd.
117,"you're talking about character name""Nikki"" right?"
118,Yes
119,Oda syndrome lmao
120,they look like 'am i cute?'
121,"I mean to be fair, the mens designs come with chiseled abs and all as well. Boichi, the artist used to draw doujinshi so I guess you could say that's where his style comes from"
122,"I think it's less about the body type, and more the faces, the guys look normal anime normal, at least and she looks kinda like a fish person"
123,"I think it's kinda similar to the ""Clannad Face"" syndrome. Not quite, but it reminds me of it. Front view, the eyes are just tiny bit too far apart and too big."
124,I know... She looks half demon I was half expecting her to be evil/cannibal when she woke up by the way her eyes squit hard and her mouth pouts like she's about to take a bite.
125,Oh shit that’s what I said when she was holding that petrified bird and the sun was shining I swear it looked like hentai
126,"I've actually dropped the manga randomly because the girls always give me whiplash but I'd say it's weirdly easier to handle in the anime, not sure why."
127,It looks like they really toned down Boichis ayylmao shojo type eyes for the girls.
129,Hopefully that’s the only time or they fixed it    The OP made her look great though!

131,"To be fair, Yuzuriha doesn't have the most extremely ayylmao design, we'll have to see how other girls are handled."
132,We have seen a gorilla in promotional material and I'd say they toned down her ayylmao too.
133,Oh yeah same. Was keeping up w the manga till a few weeks ago but the way they draw women is jus t ..... WHERE ARE HER RIBS??? HER ORGANS???? WHERE WILL THEY GO
134,Boichi can't pour his magic on females. He tryes but they always end looking like ayyy lmaos
136,"  This seems to repel a lot of people. Or just vocal ones.    I can see why. It's kind of a hallmark of Boichi's stuff, though: the guys may have different faces and varying proportions or body types although virtually all of them are absolutely ripped and shredded - Boichi  loves  drawing hard, defined muscles on his male characters, but his female characters have basically one leggy, busty, sleek, and sexy as hell body type that you'd expect from a playboy model, and mostly have the same standard doe-eyed face. It can honestly get pretty hard to tell them apart if they have the same hair color Sun-Ken Rock was extremely bad about that.    As you can probably tell, I appreciate the way Boichi draws female characters apparently we share a 'type', but I still think it's a very understandable complaint."
137,"I've noticed that with a lot of Shonen. If you look at One Piece for example, most of the female characters just look like different versions of Robin."
138,"It's the main reason why I'm finding the Wano arc so dang confusing. Between Robin, Komurasaki, O-Kiku and that other girl whose name I can't remember it's like having  four  Robins running around."
139, O-Kiku     Girl     Hmm 
140,"Personally the girls tend to feel like they belong to a different series to me. When I first tried to read the manga a year ago I closed the tab the moment Yuzuhira appeared. It's ultimately YMMV though, so some won't be bothered by it like I was."
141,"I think is because aside from Boichi the artist for the manga being a former hentai artist, his style is more in line with the general style from manhwas wich does have differences with, well… manga in general."
142,good point
143,They look better in the anime. Its been a while since I read bits of the manga but damn it gets bad.
144,"they don't bother me either, but then again I read One Piece, so maybe I'm just desensitised to it"
145,"They suffer a bit from same face syndrome, especially compared to the amazing variety in male designs. But it's little more than an annoyance for me, not grounds for dropping the manga for sure."
146,if only that one face was decent looking.
147,"well you are in r/anime, thats why. I'm yet to see any comment about that in r/manga.        fucking normies i tell you /s"
148,Yeah yuzuhira looks like a character from baki
149,"Same problem with Oda Eiichiro with the bust and tiny waist plus shoujo style eyes, but there's no lewd or ecchi moments at all. It's not even violent and it's actually educational. This is probably the most legitimate family friendly shounen manga in the past decade"
150,This is honestly worse than Oda. I've seen some of the mangaka's doijins and theyre bad. I honestly don't understand how someone can get so good at drawing male characters yet let their female characters look like  this .
151,What do you mean?
152,could you elaborate?
153,Pretty sexist
154,the men are pretty buff too so ill need you to elaborate more
155,"In general, Boichi artist for the Dr. Stone manga draws only  one  type of body for all his female characters. Legs for days, a bit busty - but not quite too much, sleek hourglass figures with hips you want to grab, just enough muscle definition to put a line down their abdomen and give them a nice ass and thighs, etc.    And their faces/eyes are basically the same doe-eyed ""did you get plastic surgery to become a Korean model?"" look. It's actually quite difficult to tell female characters apart in Boichi's work unless they have different hair colors or distinctive outfits.    On the other hand, although nearly all his guys are incredibly shredded, there are variations in body proportions and facial features that make them distinctive.    I wouldn't go as far as saying it's sexist for nearly every woman Boichi draws to look like a sex bomb who walked out of the same mold, but I can see where the folks saying that are coming from."
156,"The bodies aren't even really the problemI mean they are on some level, its more the female faces just look so damn out of place."
157,What? There's almost zero fanservice in this?
158,He’s saying the way the female characters bodies are drawn in the manga
159,Lots of people also have problems with the face eyes really. They are those giant alien looking eyes.
160,"Yes her eyes have been buggin me for the longest, like the guys eyes look completely fine but she looks weird as shit."
161,Imagine having a problem with Boichi's drawings of female bodies  NSFW?
162,I mean I don’t have a problem with it but the females bodies are def drawn differently from the one in that pic lol
163,You just WAIT.
164,is this from dr.stone manga?
165,Boichi used to draw doijinshi so probably from there. I think this is a little too much for Jump and I don't recognise the male.

180,"The answer is yes, followed by ""take me now""."
181, How gay is a man princess carrying another man?
182,AS GAY AS YOU WANT IT TO BE
183,Gay Level: 10 Billion Percent!
184,yasss
185,internet rule  16 : there are no girl on the internet
186,I want a woman to do that to me...       datass
187,"I'd do that to you, I'm a little chubby but there's some muscle there ;"
188,Im thin and light so it shouldnt be an issue then.      You got this.       oilup
189,Now kith
190,:3
191,I ship you two already
192,aaaa  .<
193,"Well he says ship, but is more like a raft, you know Stone World and everything taken into account.    But as long as it floats...."
194,"lol, I'm going to use that to describe ships I like ""they float"""
195,"  Princess carry is like a gateway drug and then before you know it, BAM your holding hands like degenerates"
196,I feel so safe when I hold hands with my bf though. It truly is intimate and lewd 
197,How gay is a woman princess carrying another woman?
198,"Hey, anyone can be princess carried by anyone.  Its 2019, enjoy what ever you enjoy.      To answer your question, i think this does it.         wallpunch"
199,Hey it's me your man
200,I was just thinking there's so much rubble inside her dress now
201,And that's not.
202,"This is the stuff of nightmares. Screw horror, this is the real deal."
203,I expected the series to end with them saving her last then he finally confesses to her and it ends.
204,"It's kinda annoying when series' end with the main couple getting together, but they could have a whole season of them together, acting like a great power couple like star vs the forces of evil and other shows"
205,"Get together before the third act? I doubt it. I'm sure they will come up with some stupid reason for dragging out them finally just getting together until the very last episode. Maybe the chick says something cliche like ""I don't deserve to be with you until we save all those people who are in danger"", and big dumb oaf totally agrees and yells a lot and this sets the premise for 100 more episodes."
206,Why can't they be in love and accept that WHILE saving people. Like...it'll make them happier and more motivated and save people...better  ;-;
207,And now we will be waiting for actual confession. I guess they are going to drag this out.
208,"""Drag this out""? They're busy fighting a fuckin monster of a man, of course there was no time for a confession."
209,I was kinda expecting that Yuzuriha heard his confession when she was petrified just like how Taiju was awake when he was petrified. I thought she would answer him right away.
210,Yuzuriha-Sama: Love is War
211,"They're both just background characters, there wouldn't be any point in milking that stuff."
212,lol you are expecting one
213,"Honestly, it would be pretty hard to even do that wouldn't? It would be different if they couldn't find her body, but obviously she's still here, kicking it."
214,Personally I thought they'd drag it out since she doesn't show up much in the OP. I figured she'd appear in it a bit more if she was present through the show. Pleasantly surprised!
215,"Senku had has in the first half with that ""this is just barely not enough"" ruse not gonna lie"
216,And now all I can hear is Tuesday when she speaks.
217,"Yeah, as a manga reader I was like ""oh just you wait :D"""
218,Least I don't have to worry about her stone form breaking...but now I have to worry about her revived form breaking.
219,AY AY AY AY
220,I need some of her on r/animemes as the next waifu the whole sub loves.    I need mah adorable memes!
221,And he doesn't even finish his confession like he swore he was going to do.
222,"Thank  God.     Can you imagine waking up to be one of only three people in the world, where one is a mad scientist and the other has been keeping himself ""sane"" by picturing confessing to an increasingly-idealized version of you for the past four thousand years?    She's out in the middle of nowhere with two dudes she barely knows. She looks around her, what does she see? Nothing but wild forest! ""Ah, there's nowhere for me to run! What am I gonna do, say no?""    What a relief to have a murderer show up, so she didn't have to worry about the  implication. "
223,"That's true, but I was under the impression the 3,700 years were just a moment to her because she was ""sleeping"" as she put it.  I guess it's true that she wouldn't really have the choice to say no in her situation."
224,"Yeah, it was just a nap for her. I'd expect Taiju to confess that he's been dreaming about this moment for 3,700 years, but even if treated realistically, she wouldn't necessarily see immediately how psychologically damaging that would be because she didn't experience it herself.    Of course, this is a light-hearted spin on post-apocalyptic fiction, so it seems neither Senku nor Taiju really suffered ill effects from their obsession. I can't imagine it going the  Re:Zero  route with the psychological ramifications of the premise. I'm sure the eventual confession will be romantic and she'll say ""yes"" freely and happily, because it isn't being set up as a world in which  implications  exist."
225,You'd get along with Taiju then.
226,"Episode 4""Wow. Consider my expectations subverted!"""
227,    AYAYAYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   
228,"And it beguns, the first  "
229,This episode turned the faces up to 11.
230,Wot Senku were among the most notable ones. It's sad that we won't be able to submit them for reaction faces though.     amurodealwithit
231,"You forgot about the about to warp 1,998,700 years ahead in civilisation Senku"
232,Is this a new meme format?
233,Let's try it out.
234,"Here, I tried my hand at it."
235,Holy shit this is fantastic
236,send it on over to /r/MemeEconomy and reap the rewards
237,Great format. Seems like this anime is great for those reaction faces
239,I'm waiting until r/Animemes starts allowing reaction images because I am lazy as fuck
240,My first thought.
241,"That face looks like a certain meme thats used often. But for some reason, I cant remember it."
242,he really is a JoJo character
243,That one is classic Boichi. You see something similar a lot in Origin.
244,Isn’t that Joey Wheeler?
245,I'm assuming this is an exaggeration since I doubt the author actually thinks humanity is over 2 million years old. Which would kinda fit since Senku already loves his 10 billion percent.
246,"seriously, the 1,000,000 subscribers submission thread couldn't have started in 6 months?? Dr. Stone is chock full of great faces!     volibearQ"
247,By the time it's over this show will have upped the whole internet's gif game.
248,This is gold ahahah
249,Are you forgetting the face that he made when the revival fluid was brought up near Mr. murderer?
250,all worthy of being discord emotes
251,I'm getting major Hiruma Youichi vibes from Senku.  Maybe it's cause they're both cocky demons with more brains than brawn.
252,Grand Blue V2
253,More like 1 billion
254,And they finally reveal why there faces and bodies have black lines running all over them. I've been pondering about this ever since episode 1 thinking it might be just artistic license. I guess science DOES have an answer for everything.
255,"Yeah, that is one of my favorite details overall, gives a nice, distinctive touch for charácter desing and it has an in-universe explanation."
256,I wonder if they're going to address her headphones!       Do they work? Are they still petrified? Do they serve a purpose? Are they just a fashion accessory? Headphones; are they plural or singular?!
257,They were never petrified. They were still around likely because it was made out of extremely environmentally-unfriendly plastic explaining how long they lasted.    But why the hell is she still wearing them?!
258,  But why the hell is she still wearing them?!    Fashion
259,Now they just have to explain how he's styling his hair.
260,The trick is it's not hair. He's growing an emergency supply of leeks.
261,"Obviously he is a Troll Doll, it just grows that way."
262,There is a certain resemblance     
263,What you talkin' bout?! Who doesn't want to look like Yami Yugi? Totally Chad bro!
264,"I kinda didn't get this, why did it leave the cracks in them again? I threw the fluid fixed that"
265,"As stated in this episode, the stone has some restorative purposes. Even if someone's stone form face is cracked, the revival method pulls together the broken parts. Yuzuriha also has this on her arm."
266,Yeah yeah I got that but not got the fact they then still have them on their person
267,"It's pretty much like a scar, where the cracks couldn't rejoin perfectly."
268,"Oh right okay, I should've probably gotten that tbh cheers"
269,"their person is cracked, it just doesn't affect them apart from having those lines, it's like sewing two pieces together and them having not being perfectly connected"
270,I see the power of the spirals is strong in Yuzuriha.
271,OUR LORD HELIX
272,"I wonder if this can apply to the ""dead"" smashed people, from my POV it's kinda the same, I understand that total split is not a crack but should follow the same logic to fill in what Is missing ."
273,"Conceniently no cracks on the girls' faces though, hmmmmm"
274,"Not trying to seem like ""oh wow I'm super smart"" but I figured everyone assumed the lines were just leftovers from the cryostasis-petrification they were in. The series had to officially address it either way though."
275,"The lines were obviously left over from the petrification process, but it wasn't obvious that they were open, gaping holes on people's faces. They could have been scars, remaining bits of stone, permanent tans from ultraviolet light slipping in where the stone was weak, or any number of things other than unmendable fissures in their skin."
276,Well there are a lot of simps in this post who didn't realize such.
277,Uh... no? There's one person who thought it might just be artistic license in the same way that white-and-green hair is probably? artistic license. Everyone else assumed it would have a scientific explanation related to the petrification but didn't know what that explanation would be.
278,"I am so ready for the many expressions, especially later on."
279,"Oooh yes , I live for their expressions"
280,Wish it was animated instead of just panned tho.
281,"yup, had it screenshotted the moment i saw it"
282,"Best reaction face in all of anime, if not animation. Change my mind"
283,Exactly it's something that made prison school so memorable and funny also translates very well into anime.
284,That's my all-time favorite Dr. Stone face drawing.    Seeing that face in the manga forced me to pause and laugh for 10 minutes straight.    The anime studio pulled the scene off  brilliantly.
285, beguns    I think ? I see what you did there
287,Oh thought you were making a pun involving guns as in the gunpowder they’re working on.
288,"Yes, they got it right!"
289,Those faces were my favorite part of sun ken rock.
290,I just lost my shit with that scene.
291,"That’s some fucking “the mask “ movie shit, face there."
292,started reading the manga after episode 2. man i am so hyped
293,Stitch if anyone wants a bigger reaction.
294,I can’t wait for the compilation of yuzurihas ‘wow’s. That and senkus ‘10 billion percent’s and ‘big oaf’s
295,Everyone has a catchphrase. Except Tsukasa. Because he's a bad guy and that's how you know he is.
296,But even him couldn't hold his laughter after hearing Taiju's logic.     cokemasterrace
297,Taiju's logic is absolute.
298,"Small moments like these are what I adore about Tsukasa's design. He is not a braindead shonen bad guy, he is a regular human being like the others. Well apart from the punching a lion to death part."
299,"Tsukasa is almost Senku levels of smart, considering how he figured out their ruse and their destination in about 1 minute of onscreen time."
300,"It's amazing he can be so smart there, but his ideal for a better world is obnoxiously dumb."
301,It’s not that ‘dumb’ just EXTREMELY misguided - he’s effectively suggesting the same thing as Hitler.
302,"It's dumb in the sense that his method of achieving his goals is dumb. It's not like humans reach a certain age and suddenly become greedy or capitalistic. His plan is never going to work in the first place, and a single minute of critical thinking would allow him to figure that out. He'd have more luck heading to some country that has similar ideals as his own, destoning the leadership there, and using them to establish society that's more to his liking."
303,"no, you misunderstand tsukasa. tsukasa wants to stay in the ""stone world"" as he calls it, without the specialized, wealth-based society of the modern age. for examples of such societies, look at the pre-Khan mongols or the dothraki from GoT. Such societies are notoriously bad at trade, so each person must generate concrete value on a daily basis--hunter-gatherers, essentially, the only successful form of communism.    Senku opposes tsukasa because he want the return of society--in his own twisted way--as he wants to build it himself. I'm with senku, as most people who appreciate modern comforts internet <3 would be, but it is understandable to hate the powerlessness of the individual in modern society"
304,"That makes sense, but that still doesn't fit with his reasoning of killing the older generation. There is literally nothing to indicate that the age of the individuals de-stoned will have any correlation with their ideology. Young people are not any more likely to go along with his plan than old people. His idea of killing the older generation is totally nonsensical and accomplishes nothing."
305,"im gonna let you try to figure this out yourself with a question, and leave my answer in a spoiler. if you were tsukasa, what kind of people would you awaken?    my answer""people in middle school would be too old, as they have learned enough history to realize the benefits of specialized roles and placeholder currency. to keep his tribe in the stone world, tsukasa would have to awaken those with no idea how to farm and no idea of economics--and never teach them otherwise. it took like 5k years for man to understand the benefit of placeholder currency, it may take tsubasa's tribe another 5k to re-obtain it"""
306,"Doing that isn't exactly feasible. How is he going to awaken that many small children and care for them all? He may be superhuman but he can't be everywhere at once. It seems pretty clear from the 2nd episode that he's fine with people his age as well. I don't think it's his ideals that are nonsense, just his methods.     It seems he would be better off resurrecting people of any age, testing the waters to see how they stand in regards to ideology, and just killing them if they don't align with his vision."
307,"  Doing that isn't exactly feasible.    sure it is. if he can feed senku and muscle, then he can at least provide for 3. awaken 2 young kids, teach them to hunt and fish for a year, then awaken 6 more, then 18 more, etc, for as long as the land can provide      he's fine with people his age    hes fine with anyone that agrees with him, but people his age  wont       It seems he would be better off resurrecting people of any age, testing the waters to see how they stand in regards to ideology, and just killing them if they don't align with his vision    this may work, but its riskier. he would have to worry about lies and mutinies and shit. kids wouldnt revolt if they never knew what they were missing"
308,"That's fair. There hasn't really been much indication thus far that either his methodology or his beliefs exactly match what you say, but if that's the direction they take with his character, I can respect it. It's still early in the anime so I'm sure his reasoning will be further explored. The way he's expressed his goals so far come off more as anti-capitalist than explicitly tribalist.     I still don't think his reasoning of killing the older generation makes any sense, either, but I guess it's just one of those things."
309,"i predict the anime finished the philosophical part of the fight in ep2, and now there is only the physical fight left until tsubasa is killed. maybe there is more depth in the manga    i went with this tribalism approach because it fits pretty well and, like you said, nothing else makes sense"
310,"Old people resist change, that's a well known fact and he knows very well how society was before.    There is a fun Star Trek episode on this, were they revive people from 200 years in the past."
311,"Humans that have grown up in a capitalistic world and lived in that system for some time will become tainted by those ideals. At least the majority will    That's why he only wants young people, because they can adept better to his more socialistic and naturalist ideals."
312,"Well, no, it’s kinda dumb in his assumption that young people are “pure”. Though killing off the adults is certainly a good way to destroy a lot of technological know-how, since outside of Senku most teenagers wouldn’t know much chemistry or engineering. But it’s just that."
313,"When he was killing off all the adults, I saw it more as him killing off anyone that could potentially challenge him - which is not dumb, it makes sense if you want to remain the king of the world - but it also effectively grinds mankind to a halt."
314,"Well, yes, it actually does make sense. It’s just the justification of them being “corrupted” that is bullshit. He’s simply killing off everyone who could have the means to oppose him or push an alternative model of society."
315,"I wouldn't say that it's dumb. I'd say It's arrogant. He believes his ideals to be so just because there is  some  merit to what he is saying. If you bring back all of the people who were used to having everything, they'd want their everything back & start drawing non-existent property lines, but the youth of the world isn't exposed to the realities of the world enough for all of them to take that leap to want everything. He's not  entirely  wrong in believing that reviving all of humanity means reviving its corruption too, but his views are so black & white; cut & dry that he can't see the forest for the trees."
316,It's a very mature and realistic view of the situation.  A world were you don't own people or land sounds very nice to me.    Senku is just a blinded idealist.
317,That was hilarious because I don't even understand how he was able to figure everything out. Dude is just the world's greatest detective.
318,"That part didnt settle well with me, I just kinda wish he knew a part of the plan and figured it out over the first half of the next episode. But then again I've seem some amazing plot points come from wtf type stuff. So who knows. Still an amazing anime though"
319,"I’m guessing they just made this part to the point to get the plot moving.    But I’m assuming his line of reasoning is to think of what they could possibly be trying to do. He weighed his options into what they could be doing if they were trying to stop him, concluded that they were trying to make weapons to stop him, especially since he stopped an arrow, but considered what they could possibly be trying to make, and that it would have to be very fast and powerful to stop him, given a crossbow couldn’t even do the trick....guns....there are volcanoes in this direction of Japan, then they’re likely getting sulphur for gunpowder.    Tsukasa is still smarter than Taiju. He could know some of these facts to help him with this conclusion."
320,tsukasa is kars
321, Well apart from the punching a lion to death part.    we all have our strengths and weaknesses
322,"""Is he... Is he actually this dumb? Am  I  missing something?"""
323,"I don't think it was laughter. It was more like, ""am I dealing with a neanderthal here?"""
324,"I feel like I'm liking Taiju's character, even more, every episode and that scene was just a perfect sum-up of who he is, very simple and almos too good for his own good"
325,"Tsukasa has ""umm"" right."
326,He's also got SHELLS! Some say that we aren't seeing Taiju in the series and he's still collecting shells!
327,Wait untill you hear his backstory
328,"seriously, Ichinose Kana's ""wow"" is the cutest goddamn thing I've heard all week."
329,"I love the fact that she's growing with a VA and getting pretty good animes, I checked my MAL and I basically only missed Fairy Gone with her in it. Her voice is nuts."
330,  everything Ichinose Kana ever says is the cutest goddamn thing ever    FTFY
331,"She's a great seiyuu, she's quite new, yet most of her roles are main or important roles."
332,"Don't forget ""SUMAHODA!"
333,He really likes his SUMAHO.
334,Senku: We're going to Hakone to make guns and Tsukasa won't know what hit him    Tsukasa: They're going to Hakone to make guns to defeat me    lmao
335,How did he know they were going to Hakone is what I'm confused about
336,Hakone is the most famous place for hot springs in the area sulfur to make explosives.
337,He could at least tell which direction they went in based on the footprints.
338,"Damn, Tsukasa is not only physically OP but also smart af .-.    And Taiju is gonna give me a heart attack handling the statues like they can not break!!!"
339,More like he is very perceptive.
340,"He also immediately recognized the liquid in the cave as nitric acid so I believe the intention is that he is smart/knowledgeable, not just instinctive"
341,"Also he figured out that they were going to Hakone  specifically  to make gunpowder, meaning that he doesn't only know  how  to make gunpowder himself or at least what it takes to do so but where to find it naturally sulfur that is."
342,"I mean, as a Japanese citizen, he should know at least some of the more famous onsens near Tokyo. I know from general knowledge that the smell of the onsen is from sulfur and I know from playing modded Minecraft and Factorio that sulfur makes gunpowder. That doesn't mean I know how to make gunpowder from sulfur myself though. Tsukasa is perceptive and has great intuition, and is already physically stronger than that oaf. If he's book smart too he's too OP lol"
343,"so what you’re saying is that Tsukasa played Minecraft, gotcha"
344,"No, what he's saying is that Tsukasa's a GAMER who wants to destroy SOCIETY"
345,  BOTTOM TEXT  
346,goddamn tsukasa is actually the mc
347,Relevant?
348,Yery
349,  and I know from playing modded Minecraft and Factorio that sulfur makes gunpowder    I can already see the headlines     VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES FUEL DOMESTIC TERRORISM BOMBING
350,"things like this make me realize how much random knowledge i have from playing videogames and watching anime. like i think the average person doesn't know that armored shoulder guards are called pauldrons.    and some people don't know what a Scimitar is, or at least cant put the name to a picture of one. but that all seems like common knowledge to me."
351,"I know theoretically how to make gunpowder, I've just resisted actually doing it."
352,"In case your curious, sulfer, saltpeter Potassium Nitrate, and charcoal. Potassium nitrate can be made from the nitric acid that they already have."
353,Maybe they will invent a bullet that can de-petrify people.
354,They'll need to warp another thousand years or so to the invention of the water gun.
355,"Not where to find it naturally, where to find a base component. The fact that Sulphur is involved in the creation of basic black powder is pretty common knowledge."
356," Not where to find it naturally, where to find a base component    Yeah, i mean find sulfur naturally, but apparently i can't write for shit.      The fact that Sulphur is involved in the creation of basic black powder is pretty common knowledge.    While certainly not  super uncommon , i wouldn't call it common knowledge."
357,Then common people should learn more science trivia!
358,"I can't imagine anyone I know not knowing. It is a very common trope in popular media of all kinds--games where you gather sulfur to make gunpowder, movies or TV shows where the occasional 'smell of sulfur' indicates explosives, etcetera. It's not like knowing that mercury is used for thermostats, which I think is much rarer to find someone who knows this. I'd say it's on a similar field of knowledge of grapes --  alcohol. The kind of fun facts you learn about not in school but by consuming entertainment of any kind--books, TV shows, video games, whatnot."
359,"I on the other hand can't imagine anyone i know, knowing about it. However the mercury thing should be way more common knowledge everyone grew up using mercury thermometers over here, so i guess it comes down to cultural differences."
360,"The  how  and  where  could be attributed to an average knowledge of Japanese history, since Nobunaga famously made gunpowder, although the circumstances were different, the ""recipe"" may common knowledge."
361,It was because he touched it and it turned his skin yellow. That's how he knew.
362,"Not many people are acutely aware of nitric acid, its properties, where it can be naturally found, and what effect it has on human skin."
363,"I feel like its more of an instinctive kind of trait, might need to wait for later episodes"
364,"No spoilers, but he does seem to have some book/practical smarts, I mean I've worked with nitric acid in the lab, but I wouldn't be able to recognise it when falling out of a cave. Or by taste. Don't try that at home folks."
365,"Kinda reminds me of L vs Light.    A battle of wit, minus the mind-games 'coz Tsukasa's pretty straightforward and would probably tell it in front of them what he knows and doesn't.    Since if he cannot outsmart them, he'll just outfight them."
366,Tsuji?
367,"Oh, fixed x"
368,Senku is me when the teacher tells there will be running on Physical Education class
369,"I don't see some other mentions of it here, or my ""ctrl+F"" just didn't find it from the uncollapsed comments, but I like how they handled the implied religion vs science thing here.    Taiju thinks that it was some divine intervention that preserved the statue, while Senku explains the scientific reason for it. Nevertheless, both line of thinking gave them hope or something useful."
370,"If I were in Senku's spot, making sure religion is dead would be one of my main priorities."
371,Why would he do that? Seems like a great way to control a confused population /s
372,"Oh, so this is where the Sid Meyers Civ VI kicks off. It makes for an interesting civilization building experience where it's a race against the clock to find a means of stopping Tsukasa.    It makes it a bit more on edge too when Tsukasa is able to deduce what they're up to. That's why every second is precious. At the very least Taiju was able to accomplish his goal and get Yuzuhira back."
373,"More like Civ III.    In that version, you could dedicate all your resources to Science and neglect all other stuff like happiness and economy, and you'll still end up winning because you'd have Tanks while the enemy are still using Archers/older stuff.    Later Civ versions kinda fixed this and made other factors like Culture, Religion, Trading, and/or generally ""realistic"" allocation of resources have more impact."
374,"you can still get lucky if an enemy civ is in a poor spot. in Civ 5 i was using riflemen and cannons against japan's measly archers, not even crossbowmen. would have left them alone too but they just swooped in and stole one of America's cities from me. well now Japan is extinct! ARE YOU HAPPY NOW"
375,"I just played a game in which Japan forward settled me on my fucking Island continent — for a 2 tile max city, since I had already settled the rest and this was relatively late game.     I destroyed that city and nuked all of his other cities, half the world away, into the fucking dirt."
376,Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
377,That sounds a bit too close to pearl harbor...apart from the extinct part of course.
378,Kinda I guess. except I was playing rome.
379,"It's a good thing it was changed then, because it sounds like it was fundamentally broken if you could ignore those other factors and pull off a tech victory without interacting with the rest of the map.    Senku going with the Civ III approach does sound entertaining though."
380,"You couldn't in Civ III, at least not on any real difficulty. You could in Civ V though."
381,"It really depends on the version of Civ, and what you had enabled in Gameplay. And what difficulty you were on    Civ 5 is the most notorious for having science ""hacks"" where you could just turtle with 1 city, rush science, and always win.     Civ III certainly had powerful science, but on higher difficulties if you didn't expand, you would get overwhelmed and be resource starved, if you expanded you needed culture and a military to maintain your borders more effectively, especially with culture flipping.     I honestly think Civ III promoted more ""balanced"" gameplay than 5, 6 or Beyond Earth. Especially since you could suck at tech, and use tech trading to stay relevant, in the most relevant use of Trading and diplomacy in almost any Civ game."
382,"  It makes for an interesting civilization building experience where it's a race against the clock to find a means of stopping Tsukasa.    I mean, dude's super fast and knows where they went. They can't have more than a few days before he arrives to crush them like bugs."
383,A few days sounds about right. As for how long before they can craft the gunpowder and have it be usable? I guess we'll find out soon.
384,Inb4 gunpowder is not enough to kill Tsukasa so Senku built a nuclear weapon instead
385,Time to walk to Fukushima!
386,I really wonder how they explain the run away reactors.
387,"If anything happened, the radiation has probably dispersed after thousands of years."
388,"don't modern reactors typically have dead man's switch systems? so autoshutdown if no input is given for a time? then it'd ""just"" be irradiated material encased in metal, water and concrete"
389,Missed opportunity to say Hiroshima
390,"Fukushima was really fucking close to be Chernobyl 2.0 well tbf, it is in some areas"
391,This is a high schooler who freaking one shot kills LIONS. He'd probably headbutt away a bullet.
392,Radioactivity will probably just evolve Tsukasa lol
393,The moment Tsukasa catches a musket ball you know it's gonna happen because anime logic is when we can officially give up and go along with   not hitler   his master plan of committing mass genocide
394,"Please, a nuclear weapon would only slow the Pinnacle High School Student down."
395,"When he said what's the dealiest/greatest weapon mankind ever produced, I was actually thinking ""why would he build a nuclear weapon on a single target"". While I was 100% thinking of bullets and guns when he announced his plan at first."
396,LOL
397,Shoul've travelled to USA and revived cody to help him
398,I've laughed way harder than i should've at this.
399,"New obvious frase, ""killing people is bad"""
400,But what if they don't die when they are killed?
401,"Then they survived, even though it killed them.            - The big oaf, 3,700+"
402,"""There's no deal being made here.""    My sides went to orbit."
403,"I wanna punch Tsukasa in the face.    he just fucking orphaned those two kids. It's pretty obvious he destroyed all the statues around them, so even what was obviously a petrified family just waiting to reunite he slaughtered their parents. And he seriously thinks that, god forbid he survives Senku figuring out gunpowder that those kids won't grow up to become pissed off shounen protagonists?!    Dude you just wrote their backstory for them!"
404,"And who’s going to take care of all these orphaned children? If he goes around murdering all the competent caretakers then HE’S responsible for every one of these poor kids. Tsukasa isn’t even considering whether the adults were good people or not.     As smart as he is, he’s really missing a big point here. These kids will grow up in an already difficult situation considering the world they’re waking up in, but they also likely won’t be taken great care of knowing Tsukasa’s new population plan. These kids are gonna be soooOoo pissed when they grow up and put together the whole story."
405,"Bingo. He's basically creating a failed system right there. Only the pure and young? Then what about other teenagers? Unless his plan is, unfortunately that as soon as he wakes up some teenagers around his age too, that suddenly they'll be forced to care for all of these kids.    What about babies who need their mothers milk? Ain't no formula in Stone World.    And if he winds up somehow keeping all these kids alive, it's inevitable a bunch of them will gladly turn on him and start a revolution to BEAT. HIS. ASS once they realize what he's done to them. He can't even spin it to the ones old enough to know better. They'll know their parents weren't bad people."
406,"Also there’s probably not many libraries or museums left so they’ll all be basing their science, government, architecture, and literally everything off of memory which is sure to backfire. Even with Senkuu, history is bound to repeat itself."
407,"3,700 years, yeeeaaaah likely no libraries left at all. Books couldn't have made it that far."
408,And if they were bad parents he basically freed them.    The children won't know he destroyed the statues anyway. So no real problem here.
409,"The thing is, he has no idea who was good parents or bad parents. Or  if kids had certain issues.    A kid with severe delays won't understand why mommy isn't coming back. A kid with separation anxiety won't care that mom and dad are gone."
410,"Destroying the corpse of a dead person may still be beneficial to reviving them and then having to kill them for real.    I mean, the stoned people are technically dead, that's why they are calling it revival fluid.    The children will adapt anyway, that's what children are good at."
411,"Except your ignoring the exact problem here.    Tsukasa is killing innocents, with no damned care in the world to who they might be. They might be doctors, scientists, or even just good people who want a good life for their families. Some of these people were just out for a stroll or a day at the beach when the incident happened. Scientists, social workers, doctors, he's killing senselessly with no regard or care.    Children with disabilities that aren't visible won't be able to adapt without their caretakers. With no way to take care of them, Tsukasa might as well have just destroyed them too. You don't know without them being revived what might've been going on inside, since Senku even confirmed the revival fluid doesn't rejuvinate, it just fills in the cracks.    Kids who had cancer before being petrified will still have cancer when they wake up.    Kids with severe mental delays who can't function without caretakers who know their conditions, won't adapt when they wake up. They won't be magically fixed.    A paralyzed kid who was confined to their hospital bed in life, would still be paralyzed and be unable to function at all.    None of this can be known until they're revived because any medical aids they had before, would have eroded away. Their parents would literally be the only means to know ""What happened""      Kids can adapt but not ALL kids are capable and in this stone world, where everyone is frozen in whatever position they were in when it happened, there is no way to know at all.     It's a gamble and he's playing God. That's what's wrong. Doesn't matter one bit if they ""might"" be abusers. That's still gambling with lives."
412,So 0.01% of the kids may die.  Kids that are so severely broken that they wouldn't have been able to life a normal life.    It's all very philosophical anyway.  Is not being revived the same as not being born or murder?  And who is truly innocent? Especially as an adult.    All in all the few good adults that suffer from his decision are collateral damage.  Just to be 100% sure that old values don't destroy the new world.
413," All in all the few good adults that suffer from his decision are collateral damage. Just to be 100% sure that old values don't destroy the new world.    My god what is this edgy shit? ""few good adults"" do you think almost all the adults you see irl are living shitheads or something? Surprise, most parents aren't abusing their children and most adults aren't thieving greedy scumbags contrary to what you seem to think, yet you think everyone other than those people are just ""few collateral damage"" and killing all those innocent people is ""no real problem"". You should leave your house once in a while man my god"
414,"Don't worry, I'm more outside than inside on most days.  I'm from Europe, and there is a huge rift between the younger and the older generation.  Tsukasu would fit very well into the more extreme spectrum of ""Friday's for future""    I'm just able to see behind the curtain.  People can do bad things without realizing it.  You own a personal car? bad  You eat lots of plastic wrapped factory-meat? bad  You don't act when bad shit is happening around you? Bad    If your personal decisions ruin the life of other people, you are not innocent.  And sadly the majority of people fall in this category.    Just as a thought experiment:  - If you revive all people the world is fucked after around 50 years.  - If only revive the young people, the world can go for many thousand years.    What would you do?"
415,"  I'm not going to argue about this, I believe this is just a difference in culture we have and I will respect your choice to hold true to your own culture."
416,"The mountains of Hakone are the steepest in the world!    Oh wait, wrong anime. Or not."
417,Pretty steep. No wonder our megane boy blistered his feet going down them..
418,run with the wind 😭😭
419,Had to run 80 miles too. Crossover episode.
420,I was scrolling in the comments hoping someone made this reference lol
422,It was said often in Running with the Wind but it might just be a japanese thing overall.
423,Thank you. I was trying so hard to remember where that was from
425,Run With the Wind was adapted from a novel with a completed storyline so that 1 season was everything RWTW had. :
426,They call me the God of the Mountains!
427,Crossover confirmed?
428,"COMPETENT BAD GUY !!!     The ending was really good, similar ot last week when it was great that Senku is not just ""technobabble"" smart but he actually got some real common sense intelligence. Now we see that  Tsukasa  immediately figures out what Senku is doing really makes him not just an actually competent person but makes his THREAT LEVEL immensely higher.     Psychical prowess being able to catch an arrow but also got brain."
429,"I'm not a fan of how perfectly he's had 0 struggle fighting the group or foreseeing their plans.    If a villain is too ""perfect"", it makes them less scary."
430,"I don't have problems with competent enemies, but I'm tired of enemies with ""perfect first guesses"" Their very first conjecture is the perfect complete plan, even when we see the MCs try to plant traps or misguidings.    Tsukasa could perfectly followed Senku just because he suspects they're getting bronze or figured a way to beat him, not jumping right intro ""they're making gunpowder"" and the result would be the same."
431,"This 100%. It's like if the viewer knows it, the villain will guess correctly on his first try"
432,"this is one of my least favorite anime tropes.  as soon as a character is designated ""smart"" they are literally always right about everything"
433,He's eye-rollingly boring.
434,"He didn't immediately figure things out - they have a headstart. Now it's a race - ""Can Senku and co create their weapon before he arrives?"""
435,"Really? He basically ran off to hunt/kill more people and when he came back, he found that Senku and Co. had left. But it took him the space of checking inside the hut then looking at footprints to figure things out, a few minutes at most. The only reason he didn't ""immediately"" figure it out is because he literally wasn't there."
436,"They initially tricked him into thinking Taiju would be out for the count for a while, buying themself a very good chunk of time. At least one night cycle went by before he figured them out. He's not perfect by any means."
437,I want to know how the fuck did he found out they wanted to build guns and in what direction they went for. I cant believe Senku left footsteps in the right direction
438,  I want to know how the fuck did he found out they wanted to build guns     Probably because he stopped that arrow shot from the crossbow. He knows Senku saw that and knew he would try to build a better weapon. What's a better shooting type of weapon than a crossbow? A gun.
439,"I don't remember exactly how much of the creation process Tsukasa remembered, so I won't give a full answer to that question, but I will say that Sulphur being a component of gunpowder isn't that uncommon, he knew they were headed in a certain vague direction, and he knew that there was a volcano that way."
440,"How in the world would he know that they wanted to extract something from a volcano, also not like he went through a process of thought, he out of nowhere stated as a fact they were trying to build fire gun. It made no sense."
442,"Oh, so he comes back, easily finds out it was all staged, says the exact sentence the MC said abiut what he was going to do and then just knows exactly the direction they went for and for what reason. I'd accept that if he was as intelligent as Senku because he's just made to be that smart"
443,What other plan do you think Senku would have made? Is there another logical conclusion to come to?
444,"The problem isn't Senku, it's how easily the behemoth dude got to that conclusion. It was some Senku level speed of thinking amd intelligence"
445,"I'm not talking about Senku's actions, I'm asking you what other conclusion  Tsukasa  could have come to. As I already said, there were already other clues given that I won't discuss since I don't actually remember if Tsukasa noticed them so you'll need to wait a week, but even ignoring those my point stands.    Edit: I just double checked. His full thought process hasn't been explained yet. Hold your criticisms until next week."
446,"Still, is he just that smart but we haven't been told that yet or was it for the sake of convenience? Because an avarage joe would probably never find Senku and co again"
447,"It's pretty reasonable from my manga knowledge, but you'll just need to wait until next week to learn the answer for yourself."
448,"Again, if he isn't some kind of genius detective there's no plausible explanation for his really fast conclusion."
449,"Why can't you just accept that there  is  an explanation, and you just don't know what it is yet? The story will tell you what it is when it gets to it, just wait a week."
450,"The way it was narrated was pretty garbage but all he really had to guess was ""how are they going to beat me."" He already tried to shoot him with a crossbow, the next step up is a gun and the first step for that is sulfur.     It would've been a lot more interesting if he was following them and picked that up along the way but it might be relevant later"
451,There wouldn’t have been time to include his full thought process in this episode for the sake of pacing. It’s an intentional choice and not an oversight.
452,"its explained better in the manga but his reasoning is that he knows how smart Senku is, and believes Senku would never make a move without a plan. He also knows that without a gun, they don't stand a chance against him. so they need gunpowder. they need sulfer to make gunpowder, and the nearest volcano is roughly the same direction their footprints are headed."
453,And you wanna tell me the avarage mind simply reaches that conclusion very fast. If he tool some time to get to that I would accept it as plausible
454,"it did take time, they just didn't show it. he probably poked around the camp for a good hour thinking about it."
455,"Ok, it just didn't look that way at all"
456,Because it's an insignificant detail it isnt worth the screen time.
457,"Dude if you think about it logically it's pretty simple to deduce. I'm the strongest stone age fighter, so if they plan on beating me they must be working on more advanced weapons. If I let them have time this super smart engineer guy will tech up and be a threat."
458,Sure - but that doesn't explain him pinpointing their location without any trial and error at all in a matter of factly manner without having anything concrete to go on. As if there's only one exact place they could gather sulfur. It was honestly bullshit.
459,"Your problem is that you are unfamiliar with the terrain. When heading in such a direction, they could have only gone there or to Mt. Fuji, and getting inside Mt. Fuji is ridiculous. But the location they went to is the closest hot spring site."
460,"No, it really isn't. Because in the same way people are saying he knew he would attempt this because he know how smart the MC is, he could just as easily used the closest hot sprint site as a bait and gone for a different one instead.         Going for the first and best spot is actually just dumb if you're assuming he's able to figure it out. It should be the first thing you consider. Which means the villain should be considering it as well. There's just no depth to it despite both being ""genious""."
461,"fanboys gonna fanboy, ur right on this one. what really happens is tsu comes back with a thick club, takes the arrow in the shoulder, and bashes everyone else's brains out anyway. not a fun story.    I like the idea of a chase. so how can we make that happen more realistically? foreshadowing which may have happened in the manga, I havent read it. Lets say in ep2 mr stone casually mentions these hotsprings. boom, everything now falls into place realistically. stone fakes the panic, thinking it is enough. tsu realizes its a feint and the chase to the hotspring begins"
462,"The guesses he made aren't out of reach for someone with his established traits and knowledge. He knows Senku's capabilities, and literally watched Senku face him down knowing the  vast  difference in their physical strength, so he knows he's not the type to panic and run away. He's an experienced primitivist, so he knows every detail of the terrain around him.    So he guesses that Senku and co are going to face him, not run, and he guesses that they'll have to use Senku's big science brain to do it because that's basically the only area where any of them surpass him. He knows which direction they're headed, so all he has to do is think about what easily accessible natural resources are in that direction that Senku and co would know about, and what use a Big Science Brain might have for it.    Basically imagine playing a game of Civilization, and you see another civ's settler headed in a direction you've already explored. You can pan over in that direction and see where they're going based on terrain and concentrations of resource tiles. A more advanced player can use that to guess what their playstyle is and what techs they might be pursuing just from knowing which resources they are prioritizing."
463," He knows which direction they're headed    He actually don't. He would actually have to track the footprints for miles before concluding anything. You don't just look at the direction and goes ""ah, figures"". Taking a detour to throw people off is literally tracking 101.         And under the assumption that Senku is a genious; why would you assume he would pick the first and most obvious spot? There's just no depth to it."
464,"Senku is a scientist, not a secret agent. He didn't take tracking 101. And if there  was  a detour or some other way of throwing the trail off, Tsukasa would have obviously revised his theory, but there wasn't.     Senku probably figured the initial ""pretend we ran away in a panic"" trick was all they had time for. Remember that this is a race. Spending a bunch of time on plans to throw off the tracking of an absurdly capable super-tracker is not worth it compared to saving that effort for more science. It's all about maximising Senku's strengths and minimising his weaknesses."
466,"   I mean, I doubt anyone in this entire thread would see bats and think ""nitric acid""    yeah seriously. also what kind of regular high school student knows what elements make up gunpowder and where to find them? get the fuck out of here with that shit.     him being able to logically deduce they'll need to make some sort of gun to deal with him after crossbow failed? SURE. him knowing how to make gunpowder and where to find the materials, and the exact location of those materials? FUCK. NO.     ""thankfully, japan is full of volcanos. go to any hotspring and you have all you can carry....""    yet Mr. Evil knows EXACTLY which one they went to? COME ON."
467,"If you’re Japanese or live in Japan, you would definitely go to Hakone since it has the most hot springs sulfur in the area. Hokkaido or any other hot spring paradise would take months to walk to."
468,"at that point it's just about pacing and thrill. Sure they could have him ponder about where senku went for a long time and show him choosing the wrong spots and stuff, but noone really wants to see that. And knowing from the VERY START of next episode that he is ON THE WAY puts a lot more thrill into what's going on. Sometimes you have to remember that he's writing a story and not making a realistic documentary. It is just better and more interesting screen time. The only other way they could have done it is just not showing him at all until he appears, which honestly might have been a LITTLE better imo."
469,"Or they could reach for something even deadlier, like a toxin, which they could administrate to him in some subtle way or so."
470,because he knows a gun is literally their only way to stop him.
471,"It was pretty obvious IMO. They already have access to charcoal and saltpeter, and hot springs are a very common place to find sulfur. And if you're in the Tokyo area and think 'hot spring'... well, it's no surprise they went to Hakone.    If I was in the same situation I'd head to yellowstone to the geysers."
472,"Senku slipped about the 4 or 3 uses of saltpeter last episode, that gave Tsukasa a clue."
473,"I found that part a little ridiculous.  I guess it's a standard anime trope to have characters precisely figure out what their enemies are doing based on little to no information.  Honestly it's just silly that the good guys' solution is to literally develop firearms from scratch xD  Imagine that plan being proposed in a tiny-bit realistic situation: we're stranded in the jungle and there's a murderer on the loose, how should we stop him?  I know!  Let's mine for sulfur and make a gun!"
474,"It wasn't exactly a very cunning deception, more of a desperate attempt at misdirection. Anyone who got a bit of perceptivity could get that just running away wasn't very Senku-like."
475,"Yeaaaaah, I know someone from two days straight, and I KNOW him as well as his best friend. Or anyone better qualified than this dumbass anyway."
476,"Senku isn't exactly that hard to get. And if there's  one  thing he doesn't look like, it's ""quitter""."
477,I think the writers should have written him to be less perfect it was somewhat annoying that he could deduce their plan straight away which seems like poor writing. It would have been better if he just happened to track them down to see where they were going and ended up discovering their plan in the process.
478,Yeah some of the stuff is certainly convenient writing at times. It's not particularly egregious but it is a little bit annoying at the moment.
479,"His whole shtick was that he was physically powerful enough to save the characters from the wild, but if that's all he was, he wouldn't be interesting. None of his deductions have been particularly difficult either."
480,"I would call ""They're going to Hakone to make gun powder to stop me"" a pretty fucking big deduction."
481,"I mean if you know what can possibly stop you, and you know what a hot spring is, it's not that big of a leap"
482,"I don't know how common this fact is among those that know what hot springs are. Then again, he knew what nitric acid was, so maybe they'll reveal his academic background later in the show."
483,high schoolers gonna be high schoolers. Not impossible for him to have learned it there.
484,"Actually I'm bored to see that everyone is currently perfect in their respectives categories, without any weak point. That simply doesn't exist. Maybe Yusuhira will also have her perfection domain. Not much hings staying though. Maybe in social intelligence/psychology or , cliché as fuck, COOKING ?"
485,hes not to perfect as he let them escape to begin with.
486,"Yeah, Tsukasa is a way better villain then I thought he would be. Just the size of him and the physical prowess he has on him is insane."
487,its really great he reminds me of e.g mother in promised neverland
492,Though that arrow catching part is pure bullshit.
493,What do you thought about him being a high schooler able to kill a lion with one punch after being stoned for 3700 years? or him picking an bird mid air? or him literally breaking a big rock apart with one punch?
494,Imagine if they made it so he could dodge bullets or catch bullets too.
495,Senku will decide to invent fucking laser weapons.
496,  parry this you filthy casual  
497,F U T U R E
498,
499,"OK we manged to build a centrifuge, now we just need to survive while the uranium spins down."
500,Dont think that would happen since he explicitly said he doesnt have the capabilities for that but it would be kinda funny if he was able to
501,"its cute how both parties are keen to what senku wants to do to take on tsukasa but i just cant take seriously that everyone, including tsukasa himself, treats gunpowder as game over for tsukasa.  the dude punched a lion to death and caught an arrow mid-air.   maybe  senku can fashion a one-shot musket type weapon with poor accuracy and reload, but then tsukasa has the intelligence and athleticism to circle around his surroundings and catch them out predator-style.      it just seems like a part of the writing that the author wants everyone in the audience to get on board with so he makes it seem like its the optimal path"
502,  maybe senku can fashion a one-shot musket type weapon with poor accuracy and reload    Or blow him up with an explosive trap. Way easier and more susceptible to succeed.
503,"there are plenty of ways to use gunpowder, not just guns"
504,"A massive problem I always have with the civilisation building stories is they almost always go straight to gunpowder like it’s easy which in a sense sure, making gunpowder is relatively simple... the problem is you can’t really make guns easily, the actually complex bit of making a gun is the mettalurgic expertise necessary to create a gun that will only explode occasionally, which is actually extremely difficult.    It seems pretty clear that they are gonna make a Bronze firearm of a sortBronze was commonly used for cannons considering the events of the episode."
505,"That's the premise of the show though. These kids are all superhuman, including Senku himself. But since they've established that up front, then it's not a problem, so long as they commit to it and don't retcon his power. If he suddenly loses his superpowers and gets killed by getting smacked with a large stick, then THAT would be a problem"
506,"I think I've seen someone do that, but in a controlled environment. Killing a lion with your bare hands is a more superhuman feat IMHO, I don't think anyone's ever done  that ."
507,"Not really, the crossbow itself was haphazardly made. It's completely possible to catch an arrow. A bullet moves much much faster than an arrow.    Now punching a lion and counting 3700 years seems bs lol."
508,But killing a lion in one hit with his bare hand wasn't?
509,"First of all me and my friends shoot arrows at each other all the time and not just catching them but we use nunchucks to deflect the arrows, dont u guys do this to as pastime event?      ;    I think its as realistic that Senku managed to know exactly the day has passed etc.     Senku is the greatest brain and this guy is the greatest athlete, people can catch arrows IRL and this guy is like the perfect pinnacle of human physic so why should he not be able to"
510,You need a competent bad guy if the main good guy is a super genius
511,"exactly I dont see why people are complaining on him catching the arrow, if Senku got absurd brain power its as realistic he can have brawl power."
512,Braun  and  brain?    Tsukasa op plz nerf
513,"I was gonna comment that his ability to catch an arrow with his bare hand was bullshit, and I looked it up and apparently people have done this before.    However    not a single one of these attempts were performed with a crossbow, all are done with standard bows. Not only are crossbows more powerful than normal bows, but their bolts are significantly smaller than arrows, and travel on average faster. If he were to actually catch the bolt successfully, his hand would have suffered first degree burns due to friction, since he caught it straight on, rather than twisting it to transfer some of the energy into his hand or at the very least, he would have suffered severe splinters and bleeding since the bolt was made of a literal stick. I stand by my original judgement, and rule this situation as  complete  bullshit and wizard magic.     ;      TL;DR:   Tsukasa is superhuman, please nerf. and also; Thank you anime, very cool!"
514,"First of all he did not use a bolted crossbow clearly he shoot a more arrow style projectile. Wood with a stone at head.     Then he charged the crossbow with his hands so it was not the more heavy version that you had to charge with your legs, nor was it the more tech advanced version they invented later as he lacked the material to build something like that.     So we are talking about a pretty low tier crosbow here that does not shoot bolts.      ;    Also a longbow for example shoot longer then a crossbow and they have very similar speed for their projectile.      ;       Speed of bolt Longbow 133.7 fps Crossbow 138.7 fps        ;    but senku is using a low tier crossbow with a bad projectile and not bolt so it likely goes WAY slower for that matter.     ;     ;    Note that the reason you used crossbow is not because they are better then a classic longbow but because it takes a lot more time to train to learn how to use any kind of bow."
515,It's kinda bullshit and annoying that he could catch an arrow.
516,He... one-punched a lion... and the MC can count for 3700 years... and you have a problem with him doing something that people have actually been able to do in real life?
517,"I've many problems with this anime but we're talking about episode 3 here, right? Or you're so spiteful because I hurt your fanboy feelings?"
518,"Fuck dude, chill. And yeah we’re talking about episode 3 but honestly why is it so wrong for me to point out that you should have seen this level of exaggeration coming from events in the previous episodes? Are they not a part of the same story? It sounds like you’re just coming up with a bullshit excuse to defend yourself"
519,"Because this bullshit was much more obvious than ""danger situation which MCs should flee somehow"". I already understood that this shounen is way worse than BnHA, don't try too hard with your fanboys feelings on me."
520,"So because you’re being hypercritical, that makes me a fanboy? Of course, it couldn’t be possible that the man who was established to be a superhuman catching and arrow genuinely doesn’t bother me! No, it MUST be blind fanboyism!! Jesus you’re something else.     Also, where did that MHA comment come from?"
521,"He wasn't established as a super human, we were told that he is unusualy strong teenager. But how his strength makes him super agile though? Just because he is strong it shouldn't make him be able to catch an arrow without training for it. So yeah, you're a fanboy who gets butthurt over valid critisizm of his favourite garbage anime."
522,"He said in the previous episode that he was a boxer? Boxers have to have really good reflexes. Also, again, ONE PUNCHED A LION. And I’m not sure if you noticed, but Senku didn’t even try to hit him with the arrow, it went past him, and he grabbed it out of the air to make a point. I’m sorry dude, I just can’t help but feel like you’re being a ridiculous asshole. And it isn’t just for this show, so I’m not being a fanboy, unlike you I don’t mind when characters in anime do whacky shit that normal people couldn’t do, as long as it’s consistent throughout the story, which THIS IS."
523,"But not bullshit and annoying to kill a lion in one punch, pluck birds from the sky, and break a huge ass boulder in a hit?"
524,It was too but the arrow was even more retarded.
525,there are literally videos on youtube that people catches a crossbow arrow. Whats new?
526,"Even if it's true, they probably spent hundreds of hours trying to do it."
527,Ok. Now I'm hooked.
528,"This is where the series starts getting way better and actually way more fun, I believe."

532,that's nuts. I can't wait to see where this goes
533,I'm actually already loving it.
534,"I'm struggling with the one dimensionalness and straightforwardness of the characters and story. Not that it's a bad thing, just not my cup of tea. Is that how it progresses, as well?"
535,"There is a moment not far from now where the story shifts, while it does remain fairly one dimensional Aquire Technology, Beat tsukasa, the Art and the characters do get pretty numerous and with greater depth. Also later technology is so fun to see get built. Dr Stone is basically all of wikipedia in his head, and the steps seem plausible and within reason."
536,"Hard to say. Personally I never noticed and just enjoyed reading the manga. The story is intruiging and the antagonist has interesting motives, and to me it feels like they don't wanna fight but they have to. There are some really touching moments etc. If it really bothers you, stop drinking someone elses cup of tea like geez man"
537,"Considering watching this one, but I really have no idea what it's about or what kind of anime it'll become. Could you possibly give me a quick breakdown? I don't mind some spoilers"

544,"I hope we get enough time to listen to Senku explain guns, because to this day I do not understand how the hell modern day guns work."
545,obviously they can't make modern day guns quite yet.
546,"Take a metal tube, close one end. Pour some explosive powder in the open end, then top it with a metal ball. Ignite the powder. You have a gun.    Everything else in modern guns is just about making them shoot faster, farther, straighter, and/or harder."
547,"  Biggest generalization is ""explosion makes thing fly fast"". While true to an extent that's not entirely accurate    Super super basic rundown, using different words in place of technical correct ones to explain purpose behind them     Gunpowder is ignited which makes a chemical reaction causing gasses to expand rapidly. flint striking, direct fire ignition, primers for modern day cased ammunition     We build barriers around that expansion to direct where it expands. So now you see the purpose of the barrel as our ""barrier"" of sorts.    And now that you know where the expansion of gasses is going you can put an object between the ignition and the opening of your structuremuzzle of the barrel.     Gasses push object object goes flying following the guidance of the barrel"
548,"Me: This episode seems pretty unique, i wonder how it will end-     ;    Taiju:   HOOOOOOOOOOOT SPRIIIIIIIINGS     ;    Me:  ┛ಠ _ಠ┛"
549,"Ah yes, the classic anime trope. Heading down to the hotsprings to make yourself a gun."
550,  HOT SPRINGS!    Expectation: ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°    Reality: ┌ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°=ε/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿ ̿
551,"Your comment almost made me burst out laughing at work, good job"
552,Hey at least They Are clearing those out of the way   Beach and Inn episodes in just the first 3
553,Hot springs episode confirmed
554,Press 'X' to doubt
555,"He is a good guy...you know, aside from all the murdering."
556,"It's nice how he's smarter than the typical villain and figured Senku's plan. While he still doesn't have the brain power and knowledge of the latter, he compensates it with brawn. He also looks a bit like a JoJo character in some He's truly a terrifying opponent.     wideeyed"

560,imo He's similar to part 1 young Dio
561,"You thought your first kiss would be with Taiju, but it was me, Tsukasa!"
562,And he's not talking to Yuzuriha he's talking to Senku
563,
564,You didn’t know? That’s Bruno Kars. He  is  a jojo villain.
565,He looks a bit like Illusio from Part 5
566,I thought it was kind of weird really how he just automatically knew Senku’s plan. Am I the only one who was like “uhhh...?” When he was just like “oh fake escape and they went to make gunpowder” how’d he think of that right off the bat?
567,"Inductive reasoning.     ""I know he didn't run away because he's not the type. So he wanted to make me  think  he'd run away. Why? Consider his goal. He wants to stop me from creating my perfect world. But in this Stone World, I am essentially the apex predator. How could a man of science stop me? Of course. With a scientific weapon that makes physical strength irrelevant. Senku hasn't fled in fear. He's left to get the materials he needs to make firearms that would neutralize me as a threat to him.""    A perfectly logical and believable train of thought, imo. The only thing the raises my eyebrow is that Tsukasa immediately knew that Hakone is the closest destination in that direction with sulfur but I don't know what passes for common geographical/material knowledge in Japan, so I buy it."
568,"He spend enough time with Senku to get a good read on the guy. Senku is wouldn’t run away, and since the crossbow didn’t work, what’s the next logical weapon he would use?"
569,"he is very much a thoughtful and smart person. he just isn't a scientist like Senku. although identifying Nitirc acid like that is a huge stretch.     him knowing the basics of gunpowder doesn't surprise me to much though. Nobunaga, the famous Japanese warlord that im sure we have all heard of, famously made gunpowder using the corpses of the enemy soldiers. leaving them to decompose out in the open produced Potassium Nitrate, or Saltpeter, which combined with Charcoal and Surfer, makes gunpowder."
570,"Throw some   ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ   in there, and you have a bit of proper JoJo."
571,Seems like hes killing all the adults.  Is he trying to create a Lord of hte flies situation?  Yes I know his goal is to not revive murderers and people who charge tax but seems like hes killing adults mostly.  Poor children are gonna be oprhans if they get de stoned.
572,"  Yes I know his goal is to not revive murderers and people who charge tax but seems like hes killing adults mostly    What? No, he already stated his goal was to get rid of all the adults because he believes they have tainted hearts."
573,"I mean, he is a nice person if you remove the whole ""murder all the filthy adults"" part."
574,"It’s literally just that one thing, apart from that he would 100% be one of the good guys, I kinda wish we could have a version with a different villain and Tsukasa with Taiju and Senku.    Cough hell just replace Taiju, boring standard protagonist, and replace him with the actually interesting Tsukasa"
575,"I kind of like the two's contrast as the unstoppable force meets the immovable object and I have a soft spot for idiots so I wouldn't replace Taiju with the world. That said, it would be nice if the learned to work around this cause I doubt Tsukasa will die so soon he's too interesting"
576,I think a fun way of looking at the show is to think of Senku as the villain tbh.
577,"From natures and earth perspective, Senku is the real villain.    Tsukasu wants to live in harmony with nature and Senku wants to destroy it for smartphones."
578,I think that gives to much credit to what is basically stone age eugenics
579,Not reviving people isn't the same as murdering them.
580,"And he has been doing both, if all the broken adults are anything to go by."
581,Repeat after me:    Tsukasa    did       nothing       wrong
582,But he destroyed an art exhibit full of stone people. It was an artistic statement! How dare he destroy it!
583,Pulling a banksy in the 58th century
584,and he created a new artistic statement with it.
585,so killing kids parents are OK now when those kids get freed someones got to explain why there parents are into pieces
586,"That really bothered me because they looked like such a wholesome family and he just destroyed the parents.    Imagine being conscious still somehow, then BAM, dead. Terrifyingly quick and sudden."
587,Anprim gang
588,"Exactly, a downright follower of Maquiavelo's work."
589,I love the reverse of Taiju not trusting him in the beginning and Senku being a little more trustworthy to him. Then and there it was vice versa. Kinda funny how that worked.
590,"Taiju has such a big, kind heart. It also helpful for supporting his vigorous nature."
591,"WE GOT US A YUZU! Pretty cute dress they made for her as well.         Tsukasa is stone cold though, just straight up killing any stone adult he finds. Oh, and he's smart to, caught on to the plan immediately."
592,"The dress acctually makes a lot of sense logisticly speaking.      How would they put a made dress on a statue.      Solution, to make it 2 peices and connect the 2 sides.       garlock"
593,Whoa!
594,"Not only that, but it looks  really  hot!      SPORTS"
595,Although they noticeably made the dress so that she can't wear any underwear with it...  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
596,Pretty sure none of them are bothering with underwear.
597,I won't be able to forget this.
598,Not a bad thing
599,"Plus, her headphones might have bluetooth in them so she can listen to some music too!"
600,That headpiece of hers is so stupid. At first I thought they were cans too but it really is just a headband with a kinda shell pattern at the ends.
601,I'm pretty sure it's part of her body. It got petrified with her.
602,Maybe she's born with it     yuishrug
603,maybe is maybelline
604,"you might not be wrong, seeing her flashback, even as a young child, she had them with her."
605,It's an antenna to communicate with the mothership. She was the mastermind behind the petrification all along.
606,"Nah, it was a different color."
607,"Of course, she's a Persocom!"
608,"To see a happy family outing then kill the parents, that's stone cold. And worse he's got that anime strength."
609,They are stone cold.  So lol.
610,"When they came across the Buddha statue still intact, I found it actually really touching that it was still up. Spiritual even, anyone else feel like that?"
611,Taiju did.
612,"Yeah, true, although, I would still be okay with Senku destroying it for some Bronze. I wonder what the bronze is for? Either they mentioning it and I forgot or it'll have to be for a gun? idk"
613,He mentioned wanting some bronze to upgrade his sextant.
614,"Ah, yes thanks :3"
615,He was going to use the bronze to make a mirror.
616,Thanks :3
617,"While using it as a mirror for his sextant is what Senku said, it's kind of surprising he didn't want it for making guns. Finding ore and smelting will be a lot of work. Maybe he can find some brass?"
618,The big oaf will want to find bras while Senku will want brass.  Makes sense
619,The original manga page is breathtaking.    It's one of those splash pages where Boichi really flexes. The sense of wonder and beauty that this manga can convey at times is carried by his art.
620,unfortunately I got an error 1011 from this page ;-;
621,"Ah, maybe the site is blocked. Try this."
622,"Thank you, it's beautiful :"
623,"Definitely, I got chills. It's the first sign we've come across that civilization existed. And it stands alone in a clearing, connecting us to the past.    Some religious iconography being more permanent than our modern buildings is both fact and poignant. I love this show."
624,gives me ozymandias vibes. c:
625,You explained it perfectly :3
626,It’s just because it’s Copper tho 🧐
627,It's made of bronze so it won't break down that easily.
628,Oh okay
629,Science b $%
630,"Damn, I wanna be a science bitch"
631,You wanna be my science bitch? ;
632,"owo, will we make explosions with sulfur? I will cosplay as megumin for you nyaaa"
633,The explosions will be a lot wetter than anything you can make with sulfur nyan 😘
634,OwO
635,;
636,"Today in japanese Jimmy Neutron ``How to make gunpowder´´    The moment Tsukasa's murderous intentions were made clear the plan changed, and now Senku needs the tool that allows anyone to be very dangerous. Gunpowder well guns, but you get me, never understimate mankind's potential for killing eachother, aren't we loveable?"
637,honestly living things were meant to kill each other from the very beginning. Peace was never an option.
638,There's is always a path for peace. It only requires mutual nuclear deterrence.
639,That's just peace on a macro scale.
640,Yes but having means of doing by means of tools and not that of the intimacy of the body makes for a very different experience of it. People are usually fine with violence on scree.
641,Tools are what advances humanity. It was our inherent trait for competition that ultimately advanced humanity forwards.
642,"I beware a lot of this. I think there's a good chuck of humanity where they were no tools and instead of enhancing or tools, we were enhancing our bodies and mind, amid more slowly and in a very different way that is now.     We live in this sort of laser focus era of external technology and metabody so people forget there is just conscioucness not limited by that and some molecules like that in the ""mario"" mushroom of episode one found in nature really put to shame even the internet once ingested. Isn't that the point of technology though, to be ingested at some point and become of molecular design ?    The notion of advencement is itself ludicrous because tools are actually a step back. Because they are non organic they create a time loop that is not on the same level as that of the rest of the world. Hence technology aims to catch back to organic quality/complexity. Until this point is reached, if it is reached, and we merge with technology on a more subtle level, there has really been no ""advencement"". We're just hurting our eyes looking too much at flat things and hurting our backs sitting too much. We've also lost a great deal of sensitivtiy and our senses lack sharpness because we have created brutal and minimalistic envrionnement that feel safe but are antagonistic to the level of diversity and richness our bodies were used to in nature exemple: this very screen and its 26 letters that are always the same and we look at all day. Our body are natural object that we have surrounded by mere toys - if you live in a city that is. It's toyland : Happy all alone with our toys ! But hey, I've got you on the other side of the world : You letter people are so nice and fun."
643,"I've pondered about this a lot, and the tools we create are to make our own lives easier and less riskier. As a proof, modern medicine skyrocketed our life expectancy. The root of scientific advancement is to forward humanity. A very primal instinct of life is to adapt and conquer through evolution. Science is an extension of that. Through science we want to adapt, and ultimately, conquer everything. Conflict is ultimately another extension of that same instinct."
644,"That's one side of it. One tale. You're attributing value where you see fit the ""lenght"" of someone life and it's realtionship to wheter it's a ""good"" thing is no quantifiable, but I guess if it's bigger it's better. I think the need for control that transparate through tools is indeed a primal instinct and maybe that's why we're in such a bad shape and have such a shit relationship with all other organism on earth. That focusing primarily on such an instinct has us forget all those other instinct that make up the human experience. Maybe the world isn't made to be ruled by some omniscient and omnipotent one person sitting ina chair in his high tower above all. But hey, we are the greatest and will continue to be ge great again. It's indeed evident science is neo christianism at its highest, light fevered inquisitor strayed of all the bullshit words but keeping the core that is the medium intact and expending on it. I think ideas and symbols should really be consider as tools and technology, admit a very primitive fom of it, and as such the highest representation we have of ourselves that is the ""gods"" will be what we try the harder to be and what guides our lives to an extent unfathomable, that of destiny, or perceived destiny."
645,"When you realize you forgot to say ""no homo""    Boichi is such a god-tier mangaka, I'm so glad the adaptation has managed to keep his style"
646,My hope is that the success of Doctor Stone means we get an Origin anime.
647,I'm still holding out for Sun-Ken Rock. There's no way in Hell or out of it that'll happen.
648,"Some of the fights in Origin would make the ""The planet will explode in 5 minutes"" look like chump change."
649,"I don't know if you watch Jojo but it'd be fun to see something like the youtube video ""Outside of DIO's World"", maybe like a ""SuperHot"" end of level sequence."
650,Story : Inagaki f cking Riichiro nibbas f cking Riichiro !
651,Can’t wait for the fireworks episode. It’s inescapable at this point
652,Especially since we got denied the onsen episode today!
653,Is that a spoiler about the contents of a future arc?  If so it probably should be spoiler tagged or in the spoiler section.      Its hard to tell sometimes with shows.
654,"As a manga reader I could reveal info on whether or not a firework arc exists, but denying or affirming its existence would be a spoiler anyways."
655,"I was joking. If I wasn’t, I wouldve put spoiler tag.“it’s inescapable at this point” is a giveaway"
656,"You just never know, so always good to ask."
657,"It is funny to consider that, given the premise, Dr. Stone is maybe the only anime where an onsen episode  would  be a spoiler."
658,"Yeah, I hate spoilers with a passion as well, I've straight up decided to abandon some communities because people can't keep their mouths shut."
659,I think he's making fun of the hot spring episode trope. So next we will get a generic fireworks episode with yukatas and whatever
660,"Well, actually, wasn’t gunpowder invented in China for fireworks?"
661,"Great episode. Love Yuzuhira finally joining the Senku science squad and while she doesn't make a big impression personality wise, I still love her of being confused and how she will still help him. It's really funny plus her face during it is hilarious.Overall, the face expressions are always top-tier hilarious. Especially Senku's reaction to Taiju revealing about the revival fluid.     Also, Tsukasa just comes across as fucking terrifying. From the fact that he killed people they are stone figures and just the agility on the man is insane.     I love how Taiju tries to say that killing people is bad but also shows his chest for some reason. I mean, I don't know if that helps your case much there man.    Overall, a really good episode that show how dangerous Tsukasa is and while we don't get much of an impression of Yuzuhira, she can be pretty fun too."
662,It’s a little scary how fast Tsukasa is able to catch  on to Senku’s plan. He’s not far off from Senku’s level of knowledge.     Also that soundtrack when they were fighting Tsukasa was fire.
663,It seems he's as wise/strategic but not as scientific which is a fun dynamic.
664,He knew what nitrac acid was in like 5 seconds so I dunno man
665,Good point
666,"Tsukasa is like the most pay-to-win broken hero in a gacha game. Broken strength, agility and vitality and now he apparently has high intelligence too...I really hope Senku's got machine gun blueprints in his head, otherwise they're screwed."
667,"Everyone in here is basically some kinda cheat character, just that Senku and Taiju  maxed out INT and CON rather than Tsukasa's STR and DEX."
668,"In this case, i wonder what did Yuzuhira max out?"
669,"She's a bard, maxed out charm"
671, Then Dr. Stone immediately says    Oh the soap ?
673,"Senku is the name of the science guy. Dr. Stone is just another name for 'soap'. Your comments make it seems like a bar of soap is saying these things, which is what JulianFoxy was poking fun at."
674,"Senku's reaction was absolutely perfect!    Nice to know that Tsukasa has some brains behind that brawn    Senku must be insanely good at Civ     They actually revived Yuzuriha. I honestly thought we'd spend the rest of the sho trying to revive her just for someone else to get the miracle fluid.    Despite just waking up and zero knowledge about what's going on, it's adorable that Yuzuriha is game for whatever they're doing.    You're really not helping yourself here man. Murder or culling they're practically the same.    I love how even Tsukasa had to pause just to process what Taiju just said xD    Taiju is such a kindhearted simpleton that it hurts my brain. I love it.    At least he's rational. There was really nothing stopping him from hurting everyone but he still chose to back down for now.     Running to Hakone? I feel like I've heard of that before, Hmm...    It's VERY reasonable for Yuzuriha to start crying.     She's the first one in this show who has actually thought about the past.    Here's a stitch of Yuzuriha's leg for absolutely no reason at all xD    THOSE WERE CRACKS!? I thought they were just cool lines! So This means Yuzuriha has a spiral crack on her shoulder?    There's rally no fooling Tsukasa. He already knows their plan. I do appreciate that this show's antagonist, while not a genius like Senku but is smart enough that he can't be easily fooled.      GUN! GUN! GUN! Although I feel like Tsukasa is the kind of person that can dodge bullets.     Looks like I spoke too early. Even the mighty Tsukasa is afraid of the GUN!"
675," Running to Hakone? I feel like I've heard of that before, Hmm...    I appreciate the Run with the Wind nod."
676," Although I feel Tsukasa is the kind of person that can dodge bullets.    Black powder has far far more applications beyond yeeting lead at someone.   If you know what you're doing you can just straight up conjure fire from thin air  , destroy a mountain, suddenly open a giant hole, and let's not forget just straight up turning the very air deadly.    Theres a reason people around the 8th century thought the stuff was literal magic."
677," She's the first one in this show who has actually thought about the past.    She's the first one in this show who seems anywhere close to a normal person, so that makes sense."
678,  You're really not helping yourself here man. Murder or culling they're practically the same.    Cool motive. Still murder.
679,"It's not murder, it's selectively deciding who gets to live!"
680,"I understand Tsukasa's motivations, but he doesn't know how to wake people up. So him essentially waging war on the only person that _does_ seems completely counterproductive. He'd rather humanity in it's entirety fall instead of waking up those pesky adults? Man. At least he's a smart villain, those are always the most fun to hate."
681,This is exactly the reason why he cannot harm Senkuu
682,"He knows, that's why he didn't do anything to Senku yet."
683,"  So him essentially waging war on the only person that does seems completely counterproductive.    That's why he needs to get away and stop Senku from killing him, reaching Senku doesn't mean he's going to kill him, but he can persuade with torture or whatever means he think of Although his murder intent is specially directed to adults to obtain the elixir.    Tsukasa is in a tight spot because he needs Senku nonetheless."
684,He doesn’t know he doesn’t know how to wake people up. He thinks he’ll be able to if he collects an entire cup of bat poop. He spent so much mental capacity trying to figure out the source that he didn’t stop to consider a mixture might be required.
685,"I'm just assuming at this point that he's aware Senkuu didn't divulge all the information about the formula, because it wouldn't make much sense outright telling him seeing as they are diametrically opposed on who to wake up. That, and he knows how smart Senkuu is, and tried to trick him into thinking they fled. That'd be like going into a monologue about your only weakness to your archenemy like in an anime.. wait."
686,"I’m not so certain. Tsukasa is smart enough to know that Senku is trying to conceal information, hence why he insists on learning the location of the cave. However, I don’t think he is smart enough to understand double deception. Tsukasa thought the secret being kept was the location of the cave, but it was actually the special formula required to make the compound. As Nitric Acid takes time to accumulate, Tsukasa hasn’t had an opportunity to try the compound out. Further, his realization that Senku is making weapons of science places an urgency on stopping Senku. As such, I doubt he would recognize the double deception.    Edit: remember, he didn’t even know about miracle liquid until the blockhead brought it up"
687,Gotta love that blockhead. It'll be interesting to see how things progress. It's times like these I'm glad I haven't read the manga yet. Makes speculation a bit more fun.
688,Basically he's an incel but substitute women with adults as a whole
689,Ageist    The word you're looking for is ageist
690,"Yeah, kinda a shame that he seems like such a smart, capable person figured out Senku's plan in under a minute yet sees absolutely nothing wrong with murdering billions of innocent people"
691,"I love the pacing in this show, it doesn't mess around. I loved how Senku sped up Yuzuhira's revival, subverted my expectations and got that off the checklist, freeing the story up to move on to other goals. Overall everything flows really well, can't wait to see what happens next."
692,"Those funny faces though, especially Taiju's."
693,I love how his face looked liked he was about to pass out of exhaustion.
694,A good chunk of the time in the manga their faces are drawn pretty weirdly so have things to look forward to friend.
695," I didnt expect to save her till way later       awe      Good job George of the Jungle, you spilled the Beans.      Damn Tarzan might figure it out.  Hes got the Nitric Acid down.      So lets see how they deal with this.      Of course he murders any adults he sees.      SAVE MOE-CHAN! COME ON DONT LET HER NOT GET SAVED!  SHES FREE! YES!      WOW  Man that was a great wow.  Shes back and sane!      GEORGE VS TARZAN LETS GO!      Damn he took the hit like a champ.      So he wont let him do as he pleases.  George is great and honorable.  But Tarzan still is a beast, so we will see how they clash fully later when everything is on the line.      Time to rank up civilization huh?      I like Moe-chan's shoulder spirals.  Everyone has neat crack scars.      Oh damn Buddha lived.  Good job bud, thanks for stickin around.      DONT CRY MOE-CHAN WE WILL SAVE EVERYONE!      So Buddha is bronze, that will be useful later.      IS HE PART SALMON!?      Hotspring are there so sulfur?  To make Guns?  Yep guns.  Not too hard to figure once you know the peices.      Wow one hell of a leap forward.      Man Tarzan is pretty smart.  Hes figureed it out too.  Guess hes more than just brawn."
696,"I'm kinda surprised by how many were surprised that she got resurrected. I mean, I read the manga, but I thought that was pretty obvious what the guys were going to do next. Whatever.     Her headphones are cute. Her little thing at the buddha statue was really cute and sad too."
697,"Well i expected like a ""Oh no the serum doesnt work on her, time to spend the rest oif the series figureing out why while they experment and save others.""      But no we just saved her right off, now we have a whole series with Moe-chan and George moe moments to look foward to.       feelsgoodman"
698,Or they'd have to revive someone else again. Or she'd be kidnapped by Tsukasa to coerce them. The reason I thought it was a possibility was that her unpetrified form isn't shown in the OP. Good job on the OP for avoiding spoilers.
699,"So we have two Promised Neverland-style characters playing 5D mind chess, and two standard shounen characters with more determination than brain power. I kinda like this dynamic!"
700,By promised neverland style you just mean smart characters who have logical deduction powers. It's not really a style
701,"In terms of them precisely guessing each other's plans down to the tiniest detail, I mean."
702,Death Note style?
703,"Exactly. Give credit where it’s due. Especially when the anime of The Promised Neverland got rid of the internal monologues, when it’s the whole point of the comparison."
704,"Jojo's and death note have them too. Maybe he was just referring to promised neverland to make it easier to understand what he's talking about, though."
705,"Wow, the girl actually got revived! I thought because of the OP that she would be stuck in that rock form for at least a cour, but she is already revived in episode 3 and it seems we finally have our straight woman!"
706,"I guess this girl will be the typical soft spoken girl with no character at all. I’m curious to see the blond chick, she seems to be important"
707,Interesting how that’s your opinion after seeing her on-screen for 15 minutes...
708,"Common useless shounen jump female character, I have nothing against her, it’s just the trope. I hope she gets some character which can make her bearable. I don’t mind spoilers."

711,"It turns out that awakening Kars was a bad idea afterall    Also, how come Yuzuriha managed to keep her weird headphones when she was Stoned? Shouldn't it have decayed like every other statue's personal belongings?"
712,In their defense it was either Kars or get eaten by Lion. Really a rock and a hard place situation
713,"Plastics like polyethylene are photo-degrading, which as the name suggests, degrades under sunlight. The process in general is slower than bio-degradation. Not only that but I would guess that the tree provided shade from the sunlight slowing down the process even more."
714,I had a hard day because of the KyoAni situation.  But i thank Dr Stone from bringing a little joy with Taiju retardness and Senku over the top love for SCIENCE!
715,I want to see all of the primate high schoolers who didn't even make top 10.
716,That's how I get to know basic science!
717,A little bored of the villain already.
718,"THEY ACTUALLY AND FINALLY REVIVED YUZURIHA GOD BLESS     exciteutawarerumono    She's way too fucking precious to show up only later in the series and I'm glad they've already dealt with this issue in Ep. 3. Now confirm the damn ship and I'll be a happy panda.     SPORTS    And Tsukasa is such an OP antagonist, it's killing me. Dude immediately found out what Senku was up to, fucking hell.     laughter"
719,"Next episode, on DR STONE!"
720,"Tsukasa gonna raid Senku's Rust house, steal all the sulfur, make gunpowder, build those AK-47s and dominate the server."
721,The worst thing about this show is that they didn't start on the beach. Also no pumpkins in sight.
722,"Im not too happy with the direction this anime just took. It went from 'trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world'. To 'now we need to make weapons to stop the one nonsensically strong guy that we revived' and its going to be the driving plot for the rest of the series most likely. On top of that there hasnt been another animal thats posed them any danger even though they just traveled quite a bit. Its obvious the random lion was just a convenient way to introduce a rather bland villain who just happened to be near by and just happened to be the one ""kid"" strong enough to fight a lion with his bare hands.... While I am enjoying the show its relying way too much on plot convenience for pretty much everything that happens. I was hoping it would be a show where mother nature was the 'villain' and they would try to restore humans while trying to survive. But not with this kind of villain in it. Goddammit shounen."
723,Tsukasa is just necessary to not make this series die. I'm very confident you will be very happy with the series in the future.
724,"Considering Senkuu’s intelligence, it was never about just survival. The main plotline is still trying to bring every human back by discovering the source of the petrification. Tsukasa poses an obstruction against that currently. So he is technically not the main villain."
725,"""Poses an obstruction"" thats just another way to describe a villian. He is 100% a villian, this whole episode was essentially to establish him as one and since hes the only villian so far, hes by default, the main villian atm. Besides I wanted mother nature to be the obstruction, not this."
726,It's only been three episodes.  Christ.  Why is everybody so nitpicky with this series?
727,Because when shit makes no sense it should be criticized?
728,Because maybe you should wait for the story to explain things before writing it off.
729,"Unless it gets revealed that there exist super human mutants in this world, Tsukasa's bullshitery can't be explained away."
730,Somebody made a light that turned every human into stone and it got cured by bat piss.  I think you can suspend your disbelief at a really strong high school student.
731,"The first two are reasonable macguffins based on possible science, one hyper strong human is bullshit. Also, guano isn't piss."
732,You must be fun at parties.  Don't watch Fruits Basket.  Your head will explode over the psychic that's there for no reason.
733,You're watching an anime who cares
734,"That's the stupidest fallacious argument when dealing with fictional media, go get a basic course on dialogue and argumentation."
735,This is reddit not your high school debate class
736,"What is the point of online social forums, again?"
737,"For an anime about science, this villain character doesn't make ANY FUCKING SENSE ¬¬"
738,"If Tsukasa were a normal human being, Senku and Taiju could have killed his ass just by ganging up on him with spears.    He's so over the top because he's supposed to be a seemingly invincible obstacle that can only be defeated by the power of science."
739," If Tsukasa were a normal human being, Senku and Taiju could have killed his ass just by ganging up on him with spears.    Well yes and no.    If he actually had normal human physical stats but expert martial arts knowledge he should be able to beat 2 average Joe's who have 0 combat experience.    Crossbow would have totally killed him though. if it was aimed at him."
740,Which is pretty dumb. It would've been better for him to be slightly stronger than Taiju and as smart as he currently is.
741,"exactly, his goal is just dumb and his abilities over the top for no reason."
742,Why?
743,"Hum, idk, maybe cause he killed a lion with 1 punch, grabbed an arrow at 200km/h and there's what will happen next epi too........ ¬¬"
744,"Senku’s hair doesn’t make sense aswell, his ability to count for 3700 years neither, but I don’t think it really kills the show honestly, it makes it more enjoyable imo"
746,Its anime jesus. Suspend your disbelief at least a little bit. If the story was that realistic it would be boring
748,They explained the stone has some kind of regenerative effect. Anything that happened within the stone shouldn't be classed as bullshit because it's unknown and still part of the set up. I also feel it characterises Senku well.    Senku was around a decent time before Taiju waked up. He could of made the crossbow then it's not really hard compared to some stuff he made.
749,To suspend disbelief a little bit would be to accept a highschool student like Senku is that knowledgeable. To suspend it a lot is to believe he could count those seconds precisely. To toss any reasoning out of the window is to accept Tsukasa's strength and agility. So far I'm unimpressed with Dr. Stone.
750,The way you speak alone tells me you're obnoxious.
751,And that opposes my argument how? Flawed writing is flawed regardless of you liking it or not.
752," 200km/s     Man, I guess Senku made a railgun while I wasn't looking."
753,"I'm not a fan of how overpowered Tsukasa is, he can fight lions, stop arrows and seemingly has about 200iq with the ability to read his opponents moves purely through deductive reasoning. Making a villain superhuman, especially in multiple fields makes them a lot less believable and hence the show a lot less emotionally engaging. It's also crazy how he went from a flawed hero with a bit of a complex to a straight up psychopathic murderer in the space of 1 episode, the pacing is so fast.    Also, I understand the thought process behind doing so but I find it kinda funny they abandoned their home area, presumably leaving all of their parents to die. I thought that may have deserved a mention when they were weighing up their options."
754,"Kinda dumb how Tsukasa just happens to know everything or is able to predict all of Senku's moves. I get that they want to make an antagonist and that people are still petrified. But still, Tsukasa is too OP."
755,Would you rather have a villain who is not a threat in any capacity?
756,"He can be threatening but the thing I have a hard time understanding is that Senku is already presented to be an unrivaled genius at his age. Tsukasa’s introduction was that of being the “strongest” yet he is able to be on par knowledge wise as well, almost mimicking Senku’s own intellect, as seen with the nitric acid scene in the cave.   Other than that, it’s like why did he choose to flee only to chase yet again? I guess he can do and be whatever he wants, but we don’t know enough about him to understand why he does whatever it is he does. Of course I’m not saying his motives, it was clearly explained in the last episode."
757,"Not gonna lie, the lack of Yuzuriha in the OP made me think something was going to go horribly wrong when they revived her"
758,"So basically now it's Adam, Eve and Steve vs Cain"
759,The gang is going on their own Hakone Ekiden?? The Run with the Wind boys would be so proud.
760,Man I just love the soundtrack in this show
761," YEAH, SCIENCE BITCH"
762,I can't not think of Tuesday whenever I see Yuzuriha now
763,"Identified nitric acid by smell and color?    For a ""primate man"" he sure knows a lot about science    JESUS CHRIST OAF, YOUR PLAN TO STOP THE MURDERS WAS TO.. LET HIM BEAT YOU TO DEATH BEFORE HE CONTINUES THEM?    YOU STUPID OAF, ""I won't stop trying to stop you!"" YOU HAVNT EVEN STARTED! YOU DON'T EVEN PLAN TO START!    I feel like they're taking a lot of liberties with the ""no buildings or ruins whatsoever"" thing. There should be ruins, even after 3000 years.    Damn that primitive man guy caught on.. instantly. big oof    damn he figured out where they were  instantly  too. Which one of them is the real man of science here?!    it didnt take our MCs group too long to get there, so evil guy will get there instantly with his insane strength and speed."
764,"  I feel like they're taking a lot of liberties with the ""no buildings or ruins whatsoever"" thing. There should be ruins, even after 3000 years.    Modern architecture is remarkably fragile. It's just not made to last. Modern buildings would crumble in a few centuries without maintenance, and all that would be left is some unusual deposits of rust from rebar.     The only buildings likely to survive that long would be in deserts or protected bunkers with a lot of corrosion-resistant metals."
765,A few centuries? More like a few decades.    The most long lasting structures wouldn't go past a few centuries except for things like the pyramids and other similar structures.
766," I feel like they're taking a lot of liberties with the ""no buildings or ruins whatsoever"" thing. There should be ruins, even after 3000 years.    I felt just now like adressing another, similar point but that's gonna have to wait... :"
767,"There was a science documentary that said most of our modern steel and reinforced concrete buildings will crumble within 500-1000 years. Water absorbed by concrete will slowly rust the reinforcing steel rods inside, which in turn creates acidic rust solution that will also damage the concrete around it. At some point, the structures will degrade enough and collapse under their own weight. After that, one or two thousand years worth of vegetation and sediment buildup will probably cover up a lot of what's left of the collapsed rubble."
768,there are a lot of earthquakes in japan. ruins are the least of the problems imo.
769,Yes but don't say that to me haha
770,Damn Tsukasa is someone that's actually born in the wrong generation. Imagine him running around in 1000 AD with those insane physical stats and decent brains. He would conquer the land in no time.
771,"Man this show is great, and I only know it exists because of someone tweeting about that Times Square ad.    Every episode feel like things are progressing in an interesting way while leaving a lot of excitement as to what comes next. Having a story which is pretty much a Civ speedrun is a great idea."
772,"its interesting, its made definitively the right way to get votes for more chapters.    So far every episode is set up to build toward a certain point but keep it as high as possible."
773,I'm so torn between absolutely loving this show and hating it just cause of how CRINGRY Taiju is :
774,"Don't worry, that issue will resolve itself soon."
775,"I swear, Tsukasa must be reading the script."
776,"Tsukasa really could've taken them all out already. The question is, why didn't he? Maybe he values Senku's mind too much."
777,"Even though Tsukasa is kinda smart, he isn't as smart as Senku and all of science's natural foundations are inside Senku's head so he can't just kill for that. Plus, I do think he likes Taiju a lot too."
778,"This is the right answer, he can't fulfill his goal without Senku"
779,That doesn't work because he wants to live in harmony with nature. He can perfectly live as he is now. I'm even surprised he needs to revive other humans since he's such a beast.
781,I felt it was obvious it doesn't give a fuck about modern era. I'm also suprised Senku is considering agriculture when it has been such a health killer in history.
782,"But isn't his goal to live in the Stone Age, basically? I didn't get the impression Tsukasa wanted to move all the way back to the Modern Era, just minus the adults. Why would he need anything other than the knowledge that nitric acid can bring back people and start working from there?"
783,"Bruh, he literally said senku is needed for humanity"
784,He doesn't know the secret of the revival formula yet. He only knows about the Nitric Acid and not the Alcohol
785," Tsukasa really could've taken them all out already. The question is, why didn't he?    Because Tsukasa is not a traditional murderous bad guy. He only has a vendetta against the boomers, and has no problem with Senkuu&crew being alive unless they get in his way."
786,Lazy millenials as usual blaming everything from the economy to the environment on boomers.
787,Millenials are too old. Now is the age of the Zoomers.
788,"he knows he needs Senku to start actually progressing farther. He might be smart, learn how live on his own, and figure out how to revive people, but he needs senku for all the stuff from soap to steel to smartphones"
789,"Probably thought they would be no threat to stopping him, needs Senku around because he doesn't know how to revive people/just wants Senku around to advance civilisation    The ideal scenario would be to just deal with Senku when he starts reviving all the older people."
790,"Yuzuriha is back yay! Unfortunately it's at the moment when they have to stop Kraven from going on a murder spree. But Science Guy is forgetting something, Kraven may be tough but Taiju has stamina that knows no bounds.      Anyways I am curious to see what Yuzuriha is gonna bring to the table for this story. Also Yuzuriha had those headphone things ever since she was little huh. Okay then..."
791,We just need Spider-Man to fight Kraven and we'll be all set.
792,Well Science Guy is good at science just Like Peter Parker is but I think were a long way away from being able to do experiments involving radioactive spiders so they may need to put that plan on hold.
793,yay waifu unlocked.
794,How the fuck did the primate high schooler immediately ascertain that Senku and co. went to Hakone + went to make guns using gunpowder? I thought Senku was the fucking scientist there.     ;    Lazy storytelling is lazy.
795,"It's basic logic that if swords and bows don't work on him, the next step is gunpowder.    Hakone is an extremely well-known bath area in Japan, and it's also basic knowledge that sulfur is a main ingredient in gunpowder. Doesn't require a Senkuu level brain to figure it out."
796,"Except sulfur isn't the main ingredient in gunpowder. It's one of the main three ingredients, I'll give you that. The actual main ingredient is saltpeter... and saltpeter is more difficult to obtain than sulfur. Some methods require at least a year to develop it, assuming you do it just right."
797,"  Except sulfur isn't the main ingredient in gunpowder.     It's one of the main three ingredients    You just contradicted yourself there. Also I said ""sulfur is A main ingredient"". Saltpeter is more difficult to obtain that's for sure, but all 3 components are equally as required in the crafting process."
798,"I did not contradict myself. You need anywhere from 66-75% saltpeter to make decent gunpowder. Earlier Europeans tried 50%. That is one of the many many reasons it took them two hundred years to figure out how to get guns to stop killing the dude wielding the gun and start killing the person on the receiving end. Sulfur is not the main ingredient, since you need far more Saltpeter than sulfur.    I realize you said it was ""a"" main ingredient, but you're acting as if it was obvious they'd be after sulfur. That's not the first thing they'd be after... probably the last thing they'd be after.    First up, they'd have to build a highly capable forge which would take them considerable time, and advance metal-working for several weeks until they get all the components necessary to make steel that isn't absolute shit. I mean... unless they plan on giving the gun to the super-human dude. Cause a gun made of shitty iron is going to blow up 100% of the time.    Actually, that'd be a pretty decent strategy. If only finding saltpeter wasn't such a pain in the ass."
799,Bruh common sense
800, wow  intensifies
801,Ah finally someone who misses their family!
802,"For the premise of this series, it really does require you to have a high suspension of disbelief. Simply taking seriously the villain's ability to just know everything is taking a lot of effort."
803,"That will be a stop for me : I really like the concept, but I just can't stand the characters...   The scientific who can count seconds for thousands of years, remember GPS locations out his head...   The muscle guy who yells everytime he speaks, and is only over trait is to be fondly in love with a girl we barely know and has at the moment no personality.  And the bad guy who is an obvious villain since episode 1, even before he was awaken. The fact that he can catch an arrow or kill a lion...      I was hoping for some kind of L Vs Kira interactions, where both sides have debatable opinions but... No. It's just ""It's all an easy game to show my perfect intelligence"" Vs ""adults are bad, let's kill them, even if... I'll be an adult someday"".    I don't say it's bad. I was hoping for something more realistic and ""philosophical"", and less overpowered and magic abilities. It's just not for me. I'm sure it's gonna be grandiose to see them build a civilisation, for sure ! But not with me sadly :"
804,"I cannot give out major spoilers, but I'd really really REALLY suggest you wait 3 more episodes if you have issues with the characters. Also Yuzuriha has a shitton of personality, it's only been a single episode."
805,Taiju's refusal to fight back sort of reminded me of Shirou's attitude.
806,The episodes are just getting better and better
807,Tsukasa thinks he’s doing those children a favor by smashing their parents. What does he think their reaction will be when they wake up holding their fathers decapitated hand?
808,"Was it just me anger because Taiju had not declared his love for Yuzuriha at the moment, even more now with her revived?"
809,"As the first person besides murderous Tarzan that they needed to stay alive Taiju revived, it shouldn’t be hard for Yuzuriha to figure out. Tho of course the shows gonna drag out the confession until some dramatic moment"
810,So many meme faces this episode. Makes my heart happy to know that this summer is gonna have some great memes from Dr. Stone alone.
811,Boichi's reaction faces are quality- I can't wait to see some of them get adapted
812,Senku: “We can’t let Tsukasa find out that we’re gonna make guns”    Tsukasa:  Finds out they’re gonna make guns 
813,Taiju so dumb he would've tried to revive the Giant Buddha. Good thing Senku was there to stop him
814,Tsukasa hearing is OP. He heard them from all the way there
815,"I like how accurate things are in Dr. Stone.     ;    Imgur     ;    To be fair they had to round the location to 35, 139 because it doesnt make sense for Senku to remember the full lat and long values. However, the inaccuracy is big if they round it off so idk if knowing the lat and long values are that useful except for maybe giving a vague current location.     ;    Imgur     ;    So the inaccuracy is around 60km which is 3/4 of their journey to Hakone from their original location which I'm assuming takes at least a day due to their journey montage and that night scene where Senku ordering Oaf to sleep scene. So idk if knowing the lat long are that important for Senku to know. Idk why they made him know it because I don't think its that useful because the inaccuracy in terms of time for travel is at least 1 day. The 60km is not even the actual distance to travel, its the displacement so its more than 60km and travel time takes more than 1 day.     ;    But still I like how most of the stuff in this show is based on real life.     ;    Edit: Why am i rambling about this?"
816,This is a super interesting premise and I'm hooked. Can't wait for the next one.
817,Taijus voice is as irritating as Astas voice was in the start of Black Clover
818,W a o  w
819,"First time reading/posting about Dr Stone here    I thought they were going to stretch out reviving the girlfriend too. Maybe Tsukasa would kidnap her statue, giving a good reason for her not being around until the season finale. But unless she dyes her hair blonde, now I’m MORE nervous about her not being in the OP."

822,"I'm just loling at all the names for Tsukasa, Tarzen, Kars, Pillar man, Karaven awesome."
823,i kinda hate the big oaf hes like asta from black clover but more loud annoying and causes trouble. he even made senku use the fluid on a useless school girl just because he likes her like wtf
824,"No spoilers, but Yuzuriha is much MUCH more useful than even Taiju."
825,"I get the primate guy being able to figure out it is nitric acid, because maybe his sense of smell is so good he can remember the smell of anything. But how the hell is he able to deduce exactly where they are going and what they are going to find there, as if it's like common knowledge that Hakone is where sulfur is and sulfur can make gunpowder. How is some random highschooler supposed to know that.    Whatever, I guess some people are lucky enough to be the strongest person on the playground and among the smartest too."
826,"   But how the hell is he able to deduce exactly where they are going and what they are going to find there as if it's like common knowledge that Hakone is where sulfur is and sulfur can make gunpowder. How is some random highschooler supposed to know that.    Well considering that he knows that primitive weapons and projectiles don't work on him, the only thing that can keep him in check is either sedatives or explosion based weaponry.    Hakone is an   extremely   well-known bath area in Japan, and it's also basic knowledge that sulfur is a main ingredient in gunpowder. Add 1+1 and he has the goal."
827,"Looking it up, I guess it makes sense that he would know Sulfur could be found there as sulfur eggs are a popular dish from there. But I think the idea that sulfur is a main ingredient in gunpowder being basic information is just completely incorrect. I think you'd be hard pressed to find more than 10% of the population would know this information off the top of their head, it's not like they teach it in school besides maybe, just maybe a single mention once in class. I'd even wager that that 10% is a generous figure.    Also, you still have to admit that him following that train of thought, especially with how fast he figured it out is still extremely impressive. That guy is easily well into the top 1% of people intelligence wise."
828, That guy is easily well into the top 1% of people intelligence wise.    Can't disagree on that. Tsukasa is very smart.
829,"Sincerely did not expect to enjoy this show so much. Totally expected a generic battle shounen, but this is just so much more fun. Love the art, the characters, the music... good shit."
830,"Like others said, this prologue arc is by FAR the weakest part of the series. If you really like it that much already, it'll get into 10/10 territory for you later."
831,"Damn, really looking forward to that!"
832,"It almost seems like Senku didn't want to go to an Onsen without a girl, so he pushed her revival."
833,"Tsukasa is an unstoppable killing machine Dr. Stone...    Mikasa is an unstoppable killing machine in Attack on Titan...    Maybe they're the same person. It makes sense.    Afterall, Mikasa is Tsukasa."
834,"Haha, doesn't Senku know that you can make smokeless powder from nitric acid and plant matter?"
835,"Smokeless powder isn't as destructive as black powder, and mostly used as a propellant for guns. Senku doesn't just want a gun, he also wants a bomb."
836,I think he is referring to gun cotton which is more useful as a bomb then black powder. Black powder is more useful for a guns since gun cotton have a tendency to rip low quality iron guns apart.
837,"Gun cotton was also very unreliable in it's production, causing multiple factories to blow up. I'm personally not a fan of it."
838,"Smokeless would rip any simple barrel apart though, black powder is way more useful given the other tools and materials they currently have."
839,Are you talking about gun cotton or something else?
840,"Gun cotton, yes."
841,"I wasn't expecting Tsukasa to be so smart, he's shaping up to be one hell of a villain"
842,And him having Bruno's VA from Jojo makes it more special.
843,"I expected this series to fill the void that is Jojo Fridays, but I didn't expect it to go this far."
844,Good thing this is a plausible reality where Tsukasa doesn't have a stand or any matter of supernatural talent or else bullets wouldn't work.
845,"""You expected the bullets to kill me but I have abandoned my humanity Senku!"""
846,"Tsukasa: ""STICKY FINGAS!"""
847,"I wonder if Yuzuhira's headphones has bluetooth in it? Maybe she can listen to some music with those puppies because apparently born with them or some shit. I mean, they do look cute on her ngl."
848,THIS. IS. GLORIOUS.
849,I think I would have liked to see more world exploration before revealing the bug bad but I can't say I'm not looking forward to seeing what happens next!
850,Well it's Japan.
851,what kind of world exploration? Looking at trees?
852,They just found a not tree in this episode!
853,"But they didn't find two not-trees, did they? nor did they find any yes trees, or any maybe trees."
854,"Yes Taiju, let’s just tell everything to Murderous Tarzan.     Senku is a good dude though, thinking of letting the two go somewhere else while he has to deal with Tarzan alone. Feelsgood.    That was another great episode. Looking forward to the cat & mouse game between Tarzan and Senku. Tarzan is going to be a scary villain isn’t he? I can already sense him hovering around our main characters throughout the story."
855,Is the formula just pure nitric acid or is it a mix of things? I'm wondering if Tsukasa already understands how to free people on his own too
856,"It's nitric acid + distilled alcohol, they explained it last episode that's why they had to make wine.     So Tsukasa is missing half the formula and the correct doses, probably, remember that it took Senku and Taiju 1 year of experimenting with stone birds to find it."
857,"It was mix of nitric acid and alcohol. But Senku took about year to finally come up with the correct formula, so it is safe to say Tsukasa doesn't have a chance to figure it out himself."
858,got it thanks. That's basically what I was asking. I'm trying to think about if Tsukasa figured out enough to at least make an attempt on reviving some backup
859,"There is a possibility, Senku and Taiju were woken up without the formula."
860,"They were over a long period of time, but thanks to the wine, they were able to make it much more potent.  So the Nitric acid alone is enough but takes a very long time, time Senku didnt want to wait for."
861,It's Nital
862,"Senku's formula is nital, which is more effective than the original formula that woke him up, which was nitric acid."
863,6 months worth of nitric acid to be precice.
864,"I hope they tone down a bit Taiju, and instead of using him as a fodder character for explaining everything Senkuu is creating, they give him a bit more of actual character like when he wanted to protect them from Tsukasa while going to the hot springs."
865,Where are the cracks on the girl’s face ?
866,Her cracks are on her shoulder and neck.
867,"Not related a lot to this episode and more like a nitpick, but I feel like they should be seeing more humans remains even after 3700 years. Like a lot of glass stuff, maybe some more resistant plastic. And I'm not sure about the buildings, but the pyramids are 3000 years old, sure they were built on a desert so no water influence, but you also have the Mayans temple that resisted pretty well too.    But again, I think they did that as a stylistic choice, seeing the characters picking trash would be boring."
868,"Don't underestimate natures ability to overtake places when not maintained, just look at Chernobyl and other abandoned places and increase it to 3,700 years."
869,"I'm not underestimating, I'm just saying we have some places close to that age that survived, I'm not sure how much care people had with the pyramids or with the temples, also a lot of the destruction happened because of humans trashing and looting those places.    And the stuff we build nowadays should be more resistant, at least to some degree."
870,"Trust me it isn't. Those were specifically built to last. are you expecting roads and pavements with ancient cars to still be about? Most things might just be buried after floods, landslides and generally decay wipes things away."
871,"Experts say most of our skyscrapers and reinforced concrete buildings will last at most 500-1000 years before they begin to fail. This is with maintenance and repairs.     Steel will rust. The steel rods inside reinforce concrete will rust concrete is porous. And once the rods start rusting, the acidic rust solution created will degrade the concrete as well. The wood and brick home you're likely living in will last maybe 100 years tops without someone doing repairs and upkeep.    Only monolith stone and pure concrete structures will reliably last the 3700 years. The Hoover Dam will probably still standing and it will likely stand for another 40,000 years.      "
872,"Mayan temples were made of stone, which is more stable than modern concrete. Here's a video about some of modern concrete's flaws.      Glass would still be glass, but given the way things shift around, it would likely be shattered into tiny pieces and just eaten up by the environment around it. Plastic is fairly long lasting, but also tends to break down due to sunlight into tiny pieces you'd never notice. There is probably plastic all around them, but you wouldn't see it."
873,I think overall Dr.Stone is going to be a great anime and hopefully it can have at least 2 seasons.It has quite a good plot and some interesting characters.This episode was alright and now we know the feeling that Tsukasa has and i kinda agree.Senku and Tsukasa are very clever as characters and i really love the animation on this anime and it has been beautifully done.     ;    Finally they got to explain the cracks on the their head
874,"So far I’m digging this show but there’s one thing I’m wondering about.    When they’re getting out of the stone shouldn’t they at least be searching for there parents? I get that shonens are usually teenager orientated but you can’t expect me to believe that Senkuu, Tsukasa, Yuzuriha, or Taiju didn’t think of looking for their parents.    Then again since it’s a shonen there’s probably a tragic backstory about how each parent has died lmao."

877,Yep. The characters don’t feel realistic. Atleast the girl was reminiscing about old times and felt sad. But the other two it seems like has no loved one which is weird.
878,So far best of season for me!
879,Suprised an episode was released even after the kyoani tragedy
880,When they started talking about sulfur I called it ahead of time that they were going to make guns/gun powder.    I get a huge kick out of correctly guessing things like this.    Also I was not expecting them to resurrect Yuzuriha so quickly. Felt like getting her out of that stone would take an entire season or not at all. Was pleasantly surprised.
881,Couple episodes in and Taiju is still obnoxiously loud and over the top. Very similar to Asta from Black Clover's early episodes. Hopefully the voice actor improves.
882,"is it my headset or are the sound effects pretty bad, especially around the arrow part."
883,"I’m not being funny or anything, but out of all the people they could have revived Taiju had to bring back his waifu first...    Yuzuriha better contribute more than being moral support/MC’s love interest or I’m going to be disappointed"
884,You've got to have someone to bring out offsprings.
885,"Are you telling me that you wouldn't do the same if the  thought  of this girl kept you from going insane for thousands of years and you thought of her at every moment? I personally think picking her was very realistic. I'm sure most people when given the choice would revive friends and family first when logically you should ignore all of them and revive only geniuses and top level workers. Some decisions aren't ""logical"" but we'd rather chose them anyways."
886,"She does have a ""skill"". No worries."
887,As much as I love this manga/anime  taiju makes it painful when he's onscreen. his personality is the absolute worst
888,same.
889,Am I the only one that thinks Tsukasa had the right idea of keeping only those that are “pure” or something along those lines.
890,"It's basically like a Kira situation. In retrospect, he's not wrong, but he's not right either. What he does makes sense if you get down to it, but it's still fucked up. All those people still had a chance to come back to life, but who knows which one will bite you in the ass later on.     It's a huge 'well yes but actually no' situation."
891,Yea the sooner those guys make those weapon of science the sooner they can get rid of Tsukasa. Nice to see Yuzuriha offer help as soon as she is freed. Food thing Senkuu thinks ahead but Tsukasa is no idiot and catches on very quick.
892,"Damn, why is Tsukasa so fucking clever? At this point I honestly will not be surprissed if he will be going to their exact location next week."
893,shit gets primal lmao
894,"really wish when he said ""while i kill people you dont know"" they just talked about their families.. seems like a great thing for yuzuriha to quickly barge in about or senku has the brains to explain why things like taxes are needed in the first place. this is just such an awkward villian. it does go to show how dumb some kids are. except that he seems smart. so I'm sure he could have been talked through it with logic. But alas this is anime. So that doesn’t seem to be the option.     Pretty solid episode though. Smart plays by senku. Smart enemy. But who knows if even a gun can stop him. Or if senku can make whats realistically a gun. Might get some cannon like knock off. I maybe would have gone for another adult. I’m sure they could have found someone strong enough to compete with him."
895,"I think his only flaw is to generalize that all adults are garbage. You can revive it and interrogate or whatever before killing them right? I mean what's gonna happen when the ""children"" he saved grows up? what determines that you should die when you reach adulthood? There plenty of holes in his childish logic despite seeking his ""fair world""."
896," I mean what's gonna happen when the ""children"" he saved grows up?    I think his idea is that the corrupt modern world is why the adults are the way they are. And that he'd have no problem with an adult who grew up in the Stone World."
897,"There are adults that are anarchists/ extreme libertarians that don’t like taxes so it’s not that he’s just some dumb kid. I think taxes are necessary, but clearly some people just don’t.    Also, how were they going to just randomly find someone who could take on someone whose essentially superhuman? They’d have to search, and they’d have to know who they are. Taiju was really lucky unlucky, I suppose when he found Tsukasa"
898,He literally left two kid statues alone while he shattered their parents.    Dude doesn't care who has family in his stone world.
899,Just get really lucky again. It’s anime after all :     And there are adults that hate them too. That’s why it’s a good argument. It should be fairly easy to convince anti genocide to someone that smart.
900,"Why, though? As much as people may hate to admit it, Hitler, Stalin, every genocidal leader in history... they were all very smart people. You don’t get to that level of political power without being so. Smart=/= moral"
901,There’s definitely different versions of smart. This guy is one that clearly logically thinks through things. I wouldn’t say trump is the same type of smart. But clearly he’s smart enough to be elected president I guess.
902,"I mean. Sure. There is a reason for taxes in todays society, our world needs taxes to function.  In this show however that society has been destroyed.  If these characters are planing on rebuilding society from the ground up they can choose any social structure they want.    There is plenty of inequality and terrible stuff today. Pollution, corruption ect.  All of that terrible stuff is gone in this anime.   This character does not want to bring those things back.    If you could make any kind of world with any political system and any social structure.... Would you honestly choose the same one we have today?  If you could put anyone in charge would you honestly put the same people that are currently in charge?"
903,Honestly personal opinion. Yes. We have different ones throughout the world though. So can’t really just say “this one” but there’s a lot that don’t work and a lot that do work quite well. And “kill all adults and put ? In charge” doesn’t seem like a good one.
904,"What if you knew. For an absolute fact. That there was a way of running the world that would be better for everyone. God hands you his secret plan for paradise.  You can make that plan real. You have the chance to make humanity perfect forever.    Just one problem.    If you wake up a single adult, they will want the old system that they are used too. Wake one of them up and the miracle paradise plan dies forever.    Do you still choose the old way and wake up the adults?    What if you knew for a fact that the old way was terrible and part of the cause for the apocolypse?    That is the situation in this anime."
905,"But.. god didn’t hand that single plan. At all? So at least currently there isn’t. They don’t know the cause of the stone, the reason, nor what they should do besides rebuilding.     Unless you’re regarding to spoilers then your spouting nonsense."
906,"This character does 'know' that the world that used to exist was bad. His every experience of it was bad.    This character does 'know' that there is a better way.  They may even have an idea of what that better world looks like.  Sure god didn't hand him the idea. But that does not matter. He believes that he has the perfect plan for paradise and that is all that matters.  It is not even an idea that is up for debate. To him it is a known fact.  The old world sucked. The world could be better. If it is going to be better we should make it so. We cant make it so if we wake up the adults. All these things are immutable facts in his mind and many of these ideas are not wrong ideas.    I am not referring to spoilers.  There are only 2 possible causes for a wave of energy turning people, and only people, to stone.    1.  Some person or alien did it.    2. It was an act of God.    If it was 1. Then that is proof that the old world sucked, that adults are the enemy of the world that could be.  Bringing back the same people and system that destroyed the world is stupid.    If it was 2. Then everything that happened is part of God's paradise plan. If god or fate turned all people to stone then god or fate woke up these characters and that is proof that these characters can make a better world.    It can only be 1 or 2 or both.  In any case it justifies the villins position.  What interpretation of those events shows otherwise?"
907,"Could also be an experiment gone wrong. Not alien. This is anime. Might as well be a new government made human only targeted nuke gone wrong birds were also hit, so we don’t know the extent, are birds wrong to god then?. And you kinda were originally stating it like it’s fact that god gave him the idea and god did this. Try to word a little differently next time so it doesn’t seem like you’re stating a hypothesis as a fact."
908,I was not hypothosiseing.    You were saying that his motivations make no sense. I was saying that a character belives that they are right and that belife makes the character make sense.    A person who knows that they are right can justify a great deal. I was asking you to imagine that you knew the answer.      'Imagine that you KNOW that you are right'    'Imagine that you KNOW that your plan is right'    Imagine those 2 things and you will understand the villin
909,"I agree, they jump to conflict way too fast and a smart-ass like Senku should have jumped at the occasion to tear apart Tsukasa’s views, because it’s unreasonable and counter-productive.     He’s right, they have the opportunity to rebuild civilization, so why not try to do better. But Senku didn’t even try to tell him the oppression of capitalism isn’t any worse than starting over by a genocide, and killing people with unvaluable skillsets and experience before they even have a chance to prove themselves. For example, is Tsukasa gonna found a young doctor, let alone, neurosurgeon etc ? Hell no.     On the parents, Senku had the most time to search for people he knew, but barely, he said himself seeing how scrawny he is, surviving took him all day. Also the main factor is that the topography changed a lot and statues were moved around by floods, hidden or crushed by debris, etc.     Then, when Taiju came back, they were busy with finding the formula. And by the time, Yuzuriya woke up, they had to run from Tsukasa. That leaves barely any time to look for statues.     Finally, Senku said it himself this episode : there’s no need for Yuzuriya to worry about her parents and everyone she knew like if they were dead since he’s already working to bring everyone back.    Edit : I forgot to quickly say on the conflict in Shonen, I have so much respect for the author of The Promised Neverland on that note. Since it’s about something in the manga, I’m not gonna say anything, but it was so refreshing to see characters being honest and trying to understand the others point of view even if they disagree, instead of subjecting us to artificial conflict like Hollywood and Disney usually does. The show Black Sails has the same respect for the viewer, conflicts and the intrigue flow organically instead of miscommunication for the sake of drama."
910,"I’m just saying it as a point of killing people they didn’t know. Obviously they have no clue where they are. So that’s why it’s a solid point. “If you just kill everyone you might end up killing X or Y and we can’t just tell you ‘don’t just go killing in this area’ because they could be anywhere” and ontop or some people being good people. Or digging into that the traumatic experience that makes him hate people is getting beat up by some random drunk, not the hundred of people who’ve potentially done good around him. Just a weird villain."
911,"Maybe Senku doesn’t try to reason with Tsukasa because he is smart enough to realize that Tsukasa can’t be reasoned with? Also there’s the fact that Senku realizes that if Tsukasa finds out how to make the revival formula, he’ll just kill Senku because he doesn’t want him potentially interfering with his plans to create the world he envisions. Honestly getting rid of Tsukasa as quickly as possible is the smartest course"
912,"I mean I believed Tsukasa when he said he respected Senku, the little guy is impressive. So he wouldn’t be totally closed to what he would have to say. He also listened to Taiju but he didn’t have anything better to add to the debate than « If you don’t stop killing people, I’ll stop you by letting you hit me without hitting back », like what ?! lol    Tsukasa is a genius fighter and proved it with the first thing he did, saving their lives. It’s not really smart to squander someone that valuable when you’re at the mercy of wild animals ; just like it’s not smart to antagonize someone as resourceful as Senku. The smarter solution is to sort their shit out and wear a get along t-shirt !"
913,The big oaf taking Tsukasa's kick was pretty awesome... even though he passed out after he left lol
914,"Was kind of disappointed that they didn't make a gun by episode 3. Then again, that would of solved a lot of problems right then and there."
915,"Tsukasa is smart enough to follow Senkus plan, but not smart enough to realize that if he went about his business breaking adult statues while avoiding the armed Senku party, is as good him winning.    He's more adept at surviving anyway, and it's not like Senku can mass produce revival fluid. Nor is Senku going to give up reviving what's left of humanity. Even if Senku were to prioritize reviving adults, is a much slower process than breaking them apart."
916,"Besides, he could easily call that cave his and stop Senku & co. from getting more nitric acid from that spot. Forward a few months and he should have a much larger population than the protagonists."
917,"I don't think that's the case. For one, he can't claim the cave as his own after Senku gets a firearm, they both know that, that's why I was suggesting avoiding Senku entirely.     Also, regarding Tsukasa making his own party of people, I don't think he can either, he does not know how. Senku told him only about the cave guano, but that alone does not work too well without the grape wine, which Tsukasa does not know about.     And even if Tsukasa did manage to slowly revive a few people just with the guano, would be no guarantee they would be on his side."
918,Twas good ngl
919,so why do they keep calling tsukasa a primate high schooler instead of just... high schooler?
920,"Super primate high schooler to be exact. From the manner in which the MCs were able to identify who he was in the previous episode, it's very likely that Tsukasa was a bit of a celebrity before the petrification. That title implies that, despite his age, he is well-known for being highly adept at surviving in the wild with barely any tools, hence he's an ultimate cave man of sorts."

923,"I didn't have much expectations for this anime from the start but I'm SO excited to see what happens. I hope it doesn't get stale like slime did, but this premise is much better IMO."
924,"Hey Senku, I'll have you know that Tsukasa is just as civilized as you are! Just because he wants to live in the stone age doesn't mean that he will have a less complicated society.    /Anthropology-rant off"
925,"All the more reason to stop him, since that just makes him a cold-blooded psychopathic murderer ;"
926,Ok so don’t hate me But   I Love Dr.Stone so far but in episode 3 I am a bit confused on how Senku says he’s going to make a gun then Tsukasa is just like   “He’s gonna make a gun”  I think it’s kinda weird that he just knows but then again some things might not be revealed yet  But apart from that   I love episode 3
927,"Tsukasa is smarter than he gave him credit for. Tsukasa knows that they would need an edge to beat him, he knows that the best edge they could get is an effective firearm. He also apparently knows that Hakone would have sulfur, which isn't  that  unlikely a bit of trivia, and has the skills to track them in that general direction. He knows enough about sulfur to know that it is a primary ingredient in gunpowder, as most modern people do, so he was able to put it together. See, Senku is a genius, and Taiju is an idiot, but Tsukasa is somewhere in between, smarter than average, just not ""super nerd"" smart."
928,"Well if you are in the mind of Tsukasa who is unbeatable physically its easy to logically deduce what Senku would do. A sword? Tsukasa would break it, but explosives and a gun? It's perfect to stop him. I dont care how strong he is he can't dodge an explosive.     Like I could deduce Senku's actions if I was in that situation. I just wouldn't know how he would make a gun or bombs"
929,"Idk, if you have the knowledge to make gunpowder, that would be a must for protection. Kinda like how where I live, there's a well known iron range. If some apocalyptic disaster happened, i would bet people would go there and try to do something with iron to give them an advantage. Just an educated guess type of thing because it makes the most sense."
930,senku so OP he’s got the P2 blueprint on wipe day
931,I was so confused of tsuka. I thought he wanted the world to be good and only murder bad people but he seems to murder many people and even the girl with the seashells which I thought was his sister since I thought he said he collected them for her as a kid
932,"I think he  gave  that girl the seashells, like ""hey, have a present,"" and then killed her parents. I think he left the kids alone."
933,He wants to kill all yhe adults because they're corrupted.
934,Did he kill any children or is it just adults?
935,I think it's just adults for now. But he did say he'll kill senku if senku gets in his way
936,I’m going to make a guess the Tsukasa also starts freeing people and making his own group of people
937,AHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! GUN POWDER!!!! GET HYPED!!!
938,If it is an experiment gone wrong then it is still humanities fault. Option 1 is still true. People and society destroyed the world and dont deserve to come back
939,someone whos read the manga does senku have to nuke this dude
940,"This episode was nice!, I have not read the manga, so this is all new for me. I was expecting the development of gunpowder on the series, but not this early on. Nevertheless, I am a sucker for sciency survival stuff, so i'm loving every single part of this with the fast paced development tbh, this would be the only good way to make this concept into an anime.        I, however, hope they actually show the correct way of making gunpowder not that i mind that much, it is still a really good show. Cuz most shows just say ""Oh, you mix sulfur and coal, and boom, you get gunpowder"". I don't think this one will tho."
941,"With the rate this show is going, they are about to F up history really badly.    It took Europe two centuries to figure out how to get guns to work. Was that because nobody thought that guns would revolutionize combat and grant them incomparable power? No. Countless people knew that. It was obvious that the nation who figured out how to make guns work would be militarily unstoppable until everyone else had them too. So why did Europe take two centuries?    They fucking sucked ass. Guns were suicide weapons you used when you wanted to make a fool of yourself and probably kill yourself, not when you wanted to do actual damage. See, when we think of guns today, we think of weapons that don't blow up in your face, actually work consistently, have projectiles that leave the barrel at high velocity, have decent aim, and are quick to reload. Today's guns are amazing. The first guns had NONE of these things. They more often than not blew up in your face, didn't launch projectiles at high speeds, took forever to load, had accuracy so bad that nobody even bothered aiming at first cause it didn't do anything, the ammunition was more temperamental than Karen, and it took minutes to reload. People tried to use guns. At best, they made some loud noises...    So what's the difference? Well the most likely thing the show will F up, and this is what would be truly tragic, is that blacksmithing is not simple. Steel isn't just some kinda magic substance you find lying on the ground. And if you just throw some iron ore in a furnace with enough charcoal you're going to get... nothing. Because you're not going to get the flames hot enough to melt it. But let's assume you build some bellows, a proper forge, and you actually get it hot enough. Congratulations. Now you've created a cracked and brittle piece of shit. Get ready to find out why nobody used guns initially.    Blacksmithing is annoyingly complicated because steel isn't just one or two elements. It's over a dozen elements in precisely the right proportions melted and poured into a mold which is designed to allow the metal to thermally contract when it cooled down without stressing and cracking. Granted, some of those elements we use today aren't critical, and there's some flexibility in the composition, but there's an order of magnitude difference in strength between shitty iron used at first and the steel we use today.    But that's just one piece of the puzzle. Gunpowder is made of mostly three ingredients, but the proportions and size of those ingredients determines its effect. You have to engineer your gunpowder to do what you want it do. Here's a pop quiz. For a novice gunsmith, do you want your gunpowder burning fast or slow? Answer""slow"" If you got that answer wrong, then what do you think would happen?""Your gun would blow up in your face, because the sudden shock would overly stress the barrel.""    All in all, it'd take a week, at least, to get a decent forge working assuming they had the right materials, another week to sort out the steel manufacturing assuming they had the dozens of raw materials required to refine metal, and another week of trial and error to get the barrel design just right.    And while that may sound good and easy and fast... manufacturing those materials often requires massive amounts of time. For example, the whole saltpeter via urine method takes at least a year. The faster method we use today is to mine it straight out of the earth, but deposits aren't common.    To conclude all of this, no, gunpowder is not the next logical step after you can make crossbows. Metalworking is the next logical step. Spend a few weeks building a forge, working with simple things like axes and knives, and eventually work your way towards guns from there.    As a side note, proving the show has already long departed from science and logic...    If you need ""weapons of science"" the cross-bow is going to do pretty damn well. You can easily get one to launch a projectile at hundreds of miles per hour, or around half the speed of a bullet. Human reaction time is at least 100 ms... which is actually only really applicable if you both know something is coming and are paying full attention to responding to whatever is coming and have exceptionally fast reaction time for a human. So if you manage to pull the trigger within 30 feet, while aiming at their body, you will hit them before they even register that you pulled the trigger.    Conveniently, myth-busters tested dodging a bullet, and the best they could do to dodge was 460 ms, assuming you were expecting it, and were focusing on specifically dodging it. In that time, a crossbow bolt could travel nearly 200 feet, depending on the type of crossbow, of course. Point is, there's no reason to develop guns if crossbows won't work. If crossbows won't work, you either have shit aim or you're dealing with a inhuman monster who can just as easily dodge your bullets too.    The more sane approach is to make a repeating crossbow that has a reasonable reload speed, and have your brute dude distract the super-human and keep him at range while you make pepper him with poison-tipped bolts. If you can find some highly poisonous snakes or something, you could extract a fair bit of venom and that shit can be really fast acting. Can't make a decent repeating crossbow? Make 5-10 normal crossbows and fire one shot only, before swapping it like some edge-lord throwing away their gun when it runs out of ammo. It works especially when reload time can be around a minute."
942,"Woah darn, you here spittin some truth! I totally agree with you dude. I feel like a lot of survivalist series have the same problems at least, the long term survival ones, that just end up rebuilding civilization."
943,"Thanks for the compliment. I'd like to write my own, one of these days... a long-form survivalist series, that is.    The trouble is that even I would have to actually do some real research and possibly build a team... and that goes for everyone who attempts to do an accurate portrayal of rebuilding society.    In 2019, one person can easily make a living focusing on one tiny little thing. Consequentially, nobody has a really solid high-level view of all of reality. Let's say you're a chemist. You might know everything about making gunpowder from chemicals and how to distill chemicals and you're super accurate when it comes to that. BUT, you aren't an expert in mechanical stuff, so when it comes to designing the gun chamber, you're no better than a layman who knows jack shit. And the mechanical dude who knows everything about gun chamber design probably knows jack shit about chemistry. And don't get me wrong, both of those are complicated professions that take years to master. Neither person is an idiot, yet neither knows enough.    Of course, this is a minor example in just the field of making guns and ammo. Yes, you can learn how to make guns from start to finish as one dude... but then there is farming. And then there is electronics. And then there is warfare. And on, and on it goes until you reach every subject out there.    You're stuck with two options.    Option 1, learn literally everything. Which is super difficult. I don't just mean ""you'd have to be really smart""... you'd have to be really smart to properly discourse on any ONE of the myriad of subjects. You need to master all of them to do this properly. So stay in college while you get your 5th, 10th, 15th, etc. degrees in challenging hard-sciences.    Option 2, collaborate. Which is debatably even harder, because you'd need to convince really smart people to waste time writing a science-fiction story.    If you want to know which option Hollywood goes with, considering they have enough money to buy all the intelligent people they could ask for... it's to do literally zero research and make shit up. Rather insulting, if you ask me."
944,"True, society nowadays is really complex, and requires the collaboration of multiple people, it's impossible to recreate it with only one person Also, have in mind that you still need to cover a lot of land and travel miles to get the necessary resources for making, for example, Steel and Bronze.     I'm interested in that story of yours btw, have you already started it? Do you have a webpage for the project?"
945,"Not really. My current method has been the ""learn literally everything"" approach, and that gets rather discouraging when you get to a new subject. I've come up with the premise, and some of the conceits, but that's just about it.    The premise is that several hundred years into the future, humanity is ready to conquer the galaxy, however faster-than-light travel turned out to be impossible. Instead, we sent ships containing hundreds of thousands of people on voyages lasting dozens of generations to the furthest reaches of the galaxy.    In order to save on space, everyone on board those ships are permanently in a VR suit with damn-near perfect mimicry of all the senses. But at one point in the voyage, the ship starts overpopulating, and so the community decides on using a simulation to decide which people to terminate in order to avoid running out of resources. That simulation is a crash-landing scenario, where the ship lands on their targeted planet with nothing in-tact from the ship. Everyone is artificially spread out throughout the planet to give everyone a fair chance. The objective is to rebuild society to the point where they can recreate the same ship they are currently on board. The first X people to make it into space win, and everyone else is terminated.    In this upcoming simulation, most of the contestants will fail. Additionally, no laws will apply to any actions that occur within the simulation, provided they don't damage the ship outside of the VR simulation. The story would focus on one character who tries to survive, throughout the many innovations and wars that erupt throughout the journey.    The one conceit to make the story a bit more interesting is that several months into the simulation, the developers temporarily add a magic mechanic to the game, much to the annoyance of everyone in the game. This alters the laws of physics within the simulation to enable contestants to use magic for various purposes. This gives the story something to focus on, while people spend several years miniaturizing electronics. Once they get to a certain death-count, magic is turned off, and society soon becomes heavily drone-based, before one group finally finishes their space-craft and completes the objective.    I've tried writing a first chapter, only to find that I'm really bad at writing characters. Coming up with realistic steps, scenes, scenarios, outcomes, all that stuff is easy. But how do you make two characters seem both intelligent and yet distinct? I came up with the basis for a protagonist who has an overly visual memory-palace. So while most people have no user-interface, the protagonist thinks he has one. As a counter-balance, he tends to overthink things and can freeze up when under pressure. But that's not much of a character, and lacks any real ideals, personality, etc.    I could probably write the story fairly well up until the moment he encounters someone else, and then it train-wrecks pretty hard."
946,"Indeed writing characters is hard. But you have a really good idea right there. If you ever make any progress on it, i would gladly back it i cant currently, but in like 2 months i could. I would love to read something like that, please please DM me if you make a webpage or blog for the project!.    May i also ask, how long will this 'simulation' run for? I will guess that the characters do not age in the simulation, as they would require years of developing to make a frikin spaceship from scratch."
947,"Thanks for the encouragement.    The simulation life-span is a little bit up for consideration. It'll be on the order of 10's of years, and contestants will age while in the game. I'm thinking anywhere from 20 to 40 years is about right. Keep in mind they will eventually surpass modern technology, and most people will have memorized bits and pieces of the schematic for the space-craft.    I think the more interesting questions is what to do with the children. The way I'm writing this story, nothing stops them from procreating. Essentially, VR can't simulate that area of the body, so the ship moves rooms around internally to allow people to procreate outside the simulation before returning to the simulation. In fact, that's part of the reason why the ship overpopulated to such an absurd degree. The solution I'm going with now is to say they get put in VR from birth, obviously, and your relatives will take care of them and train them for their turn outside the simulation, but within VR.    That also helps explain why the developers added magic early into the game. Previous games had too much sex too early into the simulation, and not enough death. The indirect method to reduce the amount of sex is to accelerate the amount of death. Can't have a baby if you were burned alive by a magical fireball... Not to say the developers aren't a bunch of insane, horny, bloodthirsty nerds. Basically, the society on the ship enforced natural selection on themselves to select for that. My history is that it wasn't always like that, but somebody figured out how to hack the ship's controls and forced the simulation games to begin. Nobody remembers what life was like prior to the simulation games, because said hacker also erased much of the ship's history, and it would take centuries to get a message to and from Earth to correct for that.    By now, Earth has probably sent a reply saying ""WTF you insane people. We worked everything out. Just do X."" but it won't arrive in time for any of our characters to hear about it. In fact, it might not arrive until a few centuries after they arrive on their targeted planet. The story won't continue past the one game, but it's interesting to think about the backstory that lead them to where they are today."
948,"Darn.  I have nothing else to say, you truly have all of this planed out dude, and it sounds amazing!."
949,"Tsukasa so OP. Does he have unlimited stamina like Taiju, too? Because if he doesn't, Taiju has a slight advantage in a drawn out fight. Taiju could just defend and tire him out."
950,"very minor but that kick had alotta force behind it, like 2-3 spins into a kick and taiju hugged it kinda. almost like a unstoppable spear vs unmovable shield kinda not really. but senku gave off yami yugi vibes before i started watching likley cus of the big hair and though hes far from it i love his character, badass in his own way always cool under pressure & the jokes and faces are funny when they wanna be. liking the show more and more every ep"
951,"You can spin all you want, that won't increase the strenght behind a kick."
952,ehh agree to disagree lol good show though
953,"It's not about opinion, it's a fact. Have you ever moved your legs in your life?"
954,i have actually that whys im disagreeing but im not arguing over something so trivial lol go patronize someone else
955,dat tsukasa guy aint normal man         ;    He reminded me of this
956,"for a show that seems to be at least kind of focused on science, a high schooler who can fight off lions with his bare hands and catch an arrow going 200kph, this guy better be some genetic science experiment."
957, Damn i gotta pick the manga back up
958,This antagonist is such a dull Gary-stu holy shit
959,"It's only been three episodes.  Unless he dies an revives himself with his Rubber Nen or reveals that Senku's entire life was all part of his plan in the next episode, let's hold judgment."
960,"Yuzuriha seems to be the classic damsel in distress. Taiju is the first person to take a kick from Tsukasa, not only is he Tarzan on steroids but he rather smart, but not enough to outwit Senku who took Taiju and Yuzuriha and fled from camp to a place far away to acquire gun powder - he's going to make some guns. Arrows don't work on Mr. Tarzan. How is he going to be able to make this in time before Tsukasa, who can move at super speeds, catches up to them?"
961,"So Tsukasa is not only OP in term of strength and agility, but he's also very good in intelligence, fucking OP villain"
962,"Am I the most stupid person. The logic, deduction and reasoning just do not work here.    -    If I am not smart enough to figure out how to survive against anything even lions and need help from Rambo, am I the smartest person?"
963,"Not sure if this has been mentioned before, but wtf is that headphone shaped thing on yuzuhiras head? Apparently it has been there since she she was little according to the throwback and survived 3700 years after being encased in stone"
964,Must be God's headphone.
965,"I really, really don't like the majority of the characters in this anime, and the fact they're high schoolers not grown up men makes it even more illogical.    Though the setting and world is too good to not follow, so I'm continuing. Just hope the characters development is going to improve. Didn't read the manga."
966,A lot of people judging the route this anime took because of certain episodes. The survival thing in this civilization will continue after this Tsukasa situation so just relax.    It's their loss anyways if they drop this lol
967,"One thing I've learned from Kenshin, if there's ever a guy named Shishio, you'd better gtfo"
968,"Man, Tsukasa is the Ultimate Zoomer."
969,Dr stone is so cool!
970,Because anime I assume
971,"Based off what I read on other comments about difficulties manufacturing guns I have a theory, though I HIGHLY doubt it'll come to reality. What if there are other civilizations out there, ones who have the other resources they need I know very convenient, but still staying true to science. Senku meets one of these civilizations, say they started producing decent metal for making a gun or say lucky enough to recently discover saltpeter or something along those lines. Considering Senku and big oaf I swear I'm close to remembering his name broke out naturally who's to say a few didn't do the same, maybe even a couple decades before to support their higher technology. It's a stretch but I really want this series to be as close to reality as possible especially after they went through the effort of having a disclaimer. I'm most likely going to have to live with a few discrepancies though."
972,Well this show is pretty awesome. I heard about the manga a while back but never started reading it. I'll certainly start reading it after this season is finished.
973,Now that they got a girl they can start recreating the civilization
974,"Ok, primate dude is the world's best detective. Bordering on telepathy."
975,"is it just me,,..,..., or does this anime straight up  suck ???     if i hear ""that doesn't move me one millimeter"" again i will kms     the premise is so   cool   tho!"
976,I-is he gonna shoot Tsukaka?
977,"why is this show so good ? it's very entertaining and enjoyable, not overly dramatic or too edgy, I don't know it's very refreshing"
978,It's major hope punk with wanting to survive. I love it.
979,"Extremely unique setting, 0 bullshit powerleveling, great writing, great comedy, great art. And this is only the warmup part."
980,"It is funny to think that those two designed Yuzuriha's dress to be revealing from the side, although they obviously have the ability to make covering clothes judging from the ones they are wearing xD"
981,"How do you get a dress on a mannequin if the arms don't move? You make a two piece, then stitch the front and back together."
982,"Look at their clothes, they are very well made, making the two pieces meet in the middle wouldn't be too difficult at all if they can achieve all of that. Was making the dress super short also part of the difficulty of dressing a mannequin?   Obviously her dress is like that for fan service, which is totally okay! You don't have to make reasonable excuses for it."
983,because that's the easiest way to dress up a brittle mannequin without breaking it.
984,You have my anime logic award nomination for 2019.
985,"It's not anime logic. Senku maybe a genius but he ain't a fashion designer. He just took two pieces of cloth, sandwiched her between them and sewed it shut."
986,"Ehhhh....    See, people were complaining about Zenitsu being a loud coward, but at least he wasn't stupid or not capable.     I can't really stand Taiju here. He's loud and stupid and annoying. I probably should drop this show at this point, as I did watch the traditional 3 episodes... It's a bit of a shame because apart from this it's okay."
988,"Hm, maybe I’ll try then, thanks:"
989,"give it a wee bit more time, probably 2 or 3 episodes, and it'll get less annoying. Trust me"
991,"Nah, I meant that even with Zenitsu's being annoying he obviously lived through the Final Test and has the skills, knowledge, and all that, that wasn't meant to describe Taiju in contrast at all :     But yeah, this is 24 eps, right? Then I guess a couple more can't hurt :"
992,"You’re a bit unfair, it’s not because he can’t follow when Senku talks about chemistry that he is stupid. I also really like their dynamic and mutual respect so he doesn’t bother me at all. They even have that Holmes/Watson, House/Wilson vibe where Senku didn’t even think to use fruits to make alcohol until Taiju said so."
993,"  that Holmes/Watson, House/Wilson vibe    Yeah, but that didn't involve SO MUCH SCREAMING and ENTHUSIASM ORAORAORAORAORAAAA... I guess that's my main issue with it. I'm getting too old for this, lol. :    I'm fine with the show otherwise, I just wish they'd tone it down a bit."
994,"Fair enough, I really like the manga Black Clover but I dropped the anime really quickly because of Asta’s VA. And I’m not gonna drop Kimetsu no Yaiba for this because it’s simply gorgeous, but I roll my eyes real hard every time Zenitsu is scared shitless or when they try to be comedic.     This is the same type of shit loud humor that we find in Madagascar. I wonder too if those elements they put in anime meant for kids which like annoying and loud one-tone gags I guess is not gonna make me stop anime at some point. I like the infinite range of those stories too much to altogether give it up, but I might at some point stick to mangas."
995,"Exactly. Well, you know, I probably outage no, that means something else... out-age? Is that even a word? outrank is... eh, whatever the target demographics of this show like twice or more, so I shouldn't be surprised, should I.      I like the infinite range of those stories too much to altogether give it up    Fortunately this season and this whole year so far is especially great to stick with watching anime, because there's just so much good stuff. I had a serious break for a time and I'm glad I picked this year to came back :"
996,"Yeah, I wouldn’t be surprised if creators, writers themselves hate to have to appeal to these target demographics, since they’re aren’t teenagers either anymore, but they have to because that simply what sells best. The good natured and simple protagonist, like Goku, Luffy and Naruto and the success of their respective story is the proof of that ; this trope being the perfect channel for a positive and empowering message about courage, determination and friendship.     We end up, with great stories, where the main character is most of the time not the best character, grim and bloody moments but rarely too definitive stuff, a beautiful patchwork to appeal to teenage boys and adult, with varying success.     So overall, it’s okay, more than okay indeed, considering the quality and the popularity of Shingeki no Kyojin or even Death Note for example."
997,"This is a bit of spoiler, but if you're really planning on dropping it, you really should first know that: Manga Spoiler""Taiju drops out from the main cast within what's probably going to be the next episode,"" so stick around a little longer if that's really your only problem with it."
998,"Those who does the '3 episode rules' are so dumb lol , drop it already, please"
999,"Yeah especially now that you insulted me, I'm right on it.    Wait, no. Bugger off."
1000,Just DO IT
1001,ok furry
1002,He was so concerned with her modesty but then allows her to be put in  that  outfit? Fuck off.
1003,This was a really good episode. I'm glad they woke up Yuzuriha; she should make a nice addition to the party. My only complaint right now is that she seems to be drawn  really  poorly by comparison. Like her face looks kind of messed up in a lot of shots. Sometimes it is fine though.
1004,the comedy of this show is really well done       every joke lands perfecly IMO
1005,Anyone just love Senku's facial expressions? They've been on point for awhile now.
1006,I actually dislike them.
1007,"Oh, well that sucks."
1008,"Wooow greaaat Tsukasa was made a bad guy and is actually destroying the statues well isn’t that fantastic? We now have a villain yoohoo. I really liked his ideals of not bringing back the shitty civilization we  all know and love but his methods yikes. It could have gone in a better direction, but nope, screw that.      I guess I’ll watch it for a bit more but this show has been a disappointment so far, I didn’t like the style and characters from the very beginning so my last hope was plot but well. I still don’t care nor do I want to see all those edgy-looking characters from the op.         Downvote me all you want, I just had to take it out somewhere. Peace out ✌️"
1009,"It's okay to have a differing opinion. The show's focus is always science, some of the characters will be tossed out later, and the characters are a little too edgy in the OP they're more comedic in the actual manga. If it's not your cup of tea, nobody is holding you at gunpoint to watch it, so it's aight."
1010,But like... how does him destroying the statues make him worse? It’s really no different from him deciding not to revive people
1011,"Except it isn't? By leaving them alone he could later decide, based on whoever was revived, whether those adults are good people or not."
1012,"But like, to be fair, it's been 3000 years...they can't revive everyone anytime soon, you never know when a tree is gonna fall on themand smash them up or another flood or earthquake.  After so much time those things become kind of meaningless, if he starts killing living breathing humans than I'll feel he's more evil."
1013,The faces in this show are hilarious
1014,"What an amazing art. Taiju waited more than ten million of hours to confess, so I thought that he will confess right away. Well, being rejected after all that time is truly terrifying. Good luck, big oaf."
1015,Man i love the Senku faces so much
1016,Man I put off reading this manga for so long and now that the anime is out I want to go read it. But do I wait 2 months for the anime to end or do I go read head now.
1017,Anime first. It's always the better way.
1018,"Do what I'm doing, read up till where the show is at, then catch up. You get twice the Dr. Stone that way and honestly you lose nothing.    Honestly I spoiled myself for this episode reading up to Chapter 7 where this ep takes place but I still really really enjoyed it."
1019,God that last Senku face was glorious.    Hell all of his faces were glorious.
1020,the ED is so fucking good. makes me even more hyped for the next episode to get here already     dekuhype
1021,Wow this anime is really interesting and i'm so hooked  !    I'm really liking the 10 billion percent catchphrase now haha. I haven't given  it much attention before but damn the artwork in this anime is really amazing. Yuzuriha is very pretty and I like her character.     Tsukasa is a great antagonist. Not only is he overpowered as heck and he's pretty smart as well. Looking forward for next episode :
1022,"I thought that was bat pee at first    Taiju and Yuzuriha remind me of Takeo and Yamato from Ore Monogatari    The ED has such a cool vibe, reminds me of Samurai Champloo    This probably my fave show of the season rn"
1023,Next time on:   The Unstoppable Force vs The Immovable Object.
1024, Wanna how I got these scars ? 
1025,Has anyone else noticed the stone head that Tsukasa puts his hand on looks like Jeremy Clarkson's statue:
1026,Senku is American
1027,"I thought plastic takes around 1k years to decompose... Why is Yuzuriha's headset still good as new after 3,7k years?"
1028,"  plastic takes around 1k years to decompose    Polyethylenethe most common type of plastic doesn't. For a substance to biodegradate, it needs to be eaten by microbes. Instead, most plastic is photodegradated, that is, the UV radiation from sunlight breaks the plastic apart into molecules."
1029,"Yeah, I'm not buying it. Even if it takes UV radiation to break them down, she was outdoors for nearly 4k years. There's no way in hell they would be in such a perfect shape. The headset should've been disintegrated long ago. Plus I didn't see a single piece of plastic anywhere else, except that headset, and we both know how common plastic is nowadays.    If they're going to use its part later on as a plot device I'm going to be pissed    EDIT: decomposing factors aside, there's no way the headset wouldn't even break after being exposed to the weather for nearly 4k years. My Logitech headset lasted only for 3 years after its side broke due to extensive usage, and they were getting exactly 0 sunlight. Material fatigue is a bitch and it would break those headphones after a short period of time if they were constantly outside."
1030,"  If they're going to use its part later on as a plot device    I doubt it'll be. Much like the differences in clotheswhy would Senkuu bother gathering red dye for Tsukasa?, I think it's just part of her character design.    It might be a bit stupid, but it's not the first weird character design detail. Senkuu's E=MC² embroidery still takes the cake."
1031,"I can forgive a lot of things in this anime, but E=MC² is some ""sodium chloride"" level stuff."
1032,Cos it's anime
1033,PE is a thermoplastic but most headsets are made of thermosetting polymers. They are way more resistant than other plastics and would probably 'survive' the sunlight.
1034,And I suppose if she was underneath a shady tree all those years they didn't get enough UV to break down.
1035,"  if she was underneath a shady tree all those years    You know that trees lose leaves, right? Even if we assume that the tree made enough shade for half a year, that's still almost 2k years. Plus she was entangled in lots of vines which need sunlight to grow, so we can safely assume that there was under the exposition of enough sunlight."
1036,I hope Tsukasa dies by guns otherwise we will have to bring out Gandhi!!
1037,"Yuzuriha seems like the heart of the team, complementing Senku the brain and Taiju the brawn. Looking forward to the next couple of episodes."
1039,They are stone throughout but when using the acid it converts them back and hardened outer shell falls off.
1040,"Senku did try reving a broken human, and it broke into a corpse. Therefore it seems like statues are solid rock until reviven, and not a inconsistency."
1041,"I'm pretty sure people turn fully into stones, when they pour the acid, it infiltrates and dissolve the stone body so they can be freed, the stone shell is just a leftover. If you tried sanding someone statue you would end up sanding their skin in stone form."
1042,Senku literally explain shit in this episode why don't you pay attention ?
1043,Senku should've skipped past onsens and gunpowders and went straight to a nuclear power plant. 700AD? More like 1945 amirite
1044,"So would all the steel&concrete buildings really disappear after 3700 years, while bronze statues remain?    Super strong and very smart. That's an uncomfortable combination in a bad guy out to get you."
1045,Bronze is in fact more durable against regular decay than steel and concrete.
1046,
1047,"Tsukasa is the true protagonist. He's like a Dragonball fusion of Senku and Taiju, brain and brawn, Taiju's colour and Senku's gravity defying hair."
1048,"Never read the Manga, I feel confused about this series. What is it about ultimately? Useful Post-Apocalyptic Survival Guide and recreating of human civilisation? Is there some kind of magic or weird things involved later on or it’s all about Do-It-Yourself and philosophical questions about the fabric of our society? Does it focus on grounded shounen things like martial arts or something?    Spoiler tag it of course, I’m just curious if this is a series for me. It’s very hard to see where is the story going after just 3 episodes."
1049,"There is no magic. Only science.    I won’t even use a spoiler, but don’t worry. Each arc will have a very clear and logical goal, lots of surprises and comfy but awesome science. The main goal of course will always be the secret of the petrification."
1050,"If it weren’t for Vinland Saga, this would be my AOTS, hands down.    As a side note, I’m pleasantly surprised that they didn’t drag out the reverse-petrification of Yuzuriha."
1051,"I continue to find the show fun, even though I'm kind of meh on Senkuu or rather, his voice actor's performance rubs me the wrong way. I like all the other characters, and I like how the show doesn't seem to be taking itself terribly seriously. I just hope this keeps up."
1052,"Damn, Tsukasa is also smart as hell.     I loved that ending, Senkuu basically getting a boner thinking about advancing civilization 2 million years in one day lol!    Hopefully Yuzuriha turns out to be helpful because my first opinion of her is just ""meh""."
1053,Anyone else notice how she got revived with her jungle clothes already on. WTF
1054,They made it for her lol
1055,They made those so she wouldn't be naked. Probably would be full of rocks though.
1056,In episode 1 Taiju revived completely naked. I guess tailored caveman clothing is an optional feature.
1057,"Again, she  would  have revived naked if they'd left her alone, but they deliberately tailored clothing  for  her so that she would  not  revive naked. That was the entire reason that they hadn't revived her yet last episode."
1059,soap
1060,Did you see handwash soap ads? Soap is the most badass thing to happen to humanity.
1061,"sponsored by Dove, you're more beautiful than you think ;"
1062,Damn i hoped They will be At least pirates before jumping to Modern times

1067,I was thinking about watching this anime is it good?
1068,"For sure, also read the manga."
1069,This anime is becoming stupid and you should feel stupid if you enjoy it. BUT THATS JUST MY OPINION
1070,Senku is a Civ 6 fan confirmed
1071,"episode 1&2 basic needs hygiene, insulation, revival jooce    episode 3 Awaken my love interest    episode 4 gun"
1072,nice
1073,"I'm super enjoying this show! Every week I just have to watch it as soon as possible. Now things are heating up.     I'm so happy they released the girl Yuzuriha. I thought they were going to keep making it seem like she would be revived but then delay it. I'm glad she's finally here! Now they make a wonderful trio.    I have to say I really like the lead characters. Senku is a weirdo but he has heart. He masks everything with logic but he still has morals and does care about others. He just hides it very well. Imo, logically it would make sense to side with Tsukasa. Tsukasa is superior in nearly every aspect, can do  anything  for you, and starting out civilization fresh makes things simpler. So why not? Because it's morally wrong and requires murder. Tsukasa is trying to play God and Senku is having none of that.     Taiju obviously is not smart and simple minded but he's dependable and trustworthy. You can see Senku won't hesitate to tell Taiju anything, even if Taiju spills the beans on occasion. Taiju is a true bro that would literally die for his friends. His courage against Tsukasa proves this. Senku would easily pick Taiju over Tsukasa any day, even if it's illogical.     So now it's a race and a competition with high stakes. I'm liking it! Tsukasa is a bit too smart but he has to be in order to keep up with Senku. I actually see a lot of parallels between this show and Death Note's L vs Light. Senku is L, a genius playing by the rules. Tsukasa is a genius who wants to play God."
1074,Can we expect the fastest onsen episode of all anime time with episode 3? Wonder when the. Beach episode will happen
1075,they already went to the beach to get clams tho
1076,Episode 2. Shells.
1078,You mean Yuzuriya lol    Taiji dressed up her statue so she would be dressed when revived for this reason.
1079,Amazing episode!
1080,"I thought they were going to go with the angle that no remnants of the human civilization are left, but then they find a bronze statue that is almost completely fine and not buried or anything. I guess I should think it's more symbolic than anything."
1081,"Errrr... Bronze barely corrodes, 3700 years isn't enough to destroy bronze structures."
1082,"Sure, but am I to believe that at the same time every other building has disappeared from existence?"
1083,"Yes because nearly all other human structures, especially those in modern day, would collapse within a few decades without maintenance."
1084,"Bronze=/=iron and concrete, BAKA."
1085,"Yes? Because that would happen to almost all human structures after 3000 fucking years. It's, like, science."
1086,"Yes, you are, because bronze is in fact more resistant than most other materials. I guess they should be able to find some other shit if they dig, but it's not that unbelievable."
1087,"I guess all I'm saying is I wish they run into more old structures, like the overgrown remnants of a castle. But I'm unsure if the author is interested in exploring more of that kind of historical stuff."
1088,Some of the oldest known swords are from  3300 BC and make of copper and arsenic.
1089,"They literally stated in the episode that bronze doesn't rot, Speedwatcher-kun."
1090,"I know, and I'm also glad they acknowledged that they could've used the statue for materials. Since the beginning I've just wanted them to explore the possibility of using something human-made from the past.    Like surely some stone structures and at least things made of noble metals could be intact. Though it might be hard to find them."
1091,Bronze
1092,I get the reason why it hasn't disintegrated. Just wasn't expecting anything like this. But I guess that's the point. It's a little like the Statue of Liberty scene from Planet of the Apes.
1093,"YOU MANIACS! YOU BLEW IT UP! AH, DAMN You! DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!"
1094,"Oh, by symbolic I mean that the point is not that they found useful material or that they're going to seek out anything similar to harvest. That's not what the story is about. They only found the statue because it's a meaningful landmark and it solidifies the fact that this really is Japan thousands of years later."
1095,Wow
