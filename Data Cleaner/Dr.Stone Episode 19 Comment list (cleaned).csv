1,"Some panels ended up being rearranged by order in the anime, but it did cover the entirety of ch. 50 for those who wish to read the manga.    &nbsp;    Welcome to the beginning of the Stone War Arc."
2,  Original comment by  u timelesstrix0 |  Top-level comment     ---    the stone war arc finally starts.... def gona end b4 conclusion tho..    ---     This message was posted by a bot because originally submitted  outside of the Source Material Corner. 
3,"My biggest concern right now is where is this gonna end? Because I actually thought they would end with Byakuya and his whole thing but were not.... so I can't really tell where their gonna end it. Unless they rush the hell out of it, I can't see them getting to the conclusion."
4,It's definitely gonna end at an odd place.  There's no way they will make it all the way to the end of this war before the end of the season.  My guess it'll end after they've made the cell phone.  This did take quite a lot of chapters to finish.
5,They'll get to do the Magma chapter and... I'm fine with that.
6,"I'm gonna guess around  ""right at the start of the Stone War. Maybe Chrome becoming prisoner could act as the cliffhanger?"" . Any more than that and the season ends in the middle of action so..."
7,"It would be so bad if they ended it at the chapter where they captured the soldiers in what? 30 seconds? Yeah, that would be bad."
8,"  Original comment by  u give up-the ghost |  Parent comment   r anime comments dtgzdp dr stone episode 19 discussion f6wkhpf      ---    yeah, I read ahead in the manga, and by reading ahead I mean I quickly skimmed through it. There's still a whollllle lotta manga material to be covered before what would seem like a good climatic end. The story is going into this war arc with Senku vs. Tsukasa, yet with only 5 episodes left, idk how they are gonna adapt the entire war arc for the anime. Unless they already have a season 2 already confirmed, s1 might have to just end of a cliffhanger.    ---     This message was posted by a bot because originally submitted  outside of the Source Material Corner.

13,"Holy shit!    Those guys died        Still no katana slicing tho, still pisses me off that they we're busy chatting and peacefully cutting up each other's weapons.      What the heck, Magma? You seem to be fine brutally ""murdering"" Gen."
14,"Magma is such a weird character to have around. He hasn't changed at all and yet, he's just kinda indifferent to the whole thing now.     I do like that this anime isn't afraid of killing characters. I mean, those soldiers weren't important but the fact that we did see them die was interesting to see."
15,"I think its cause they have a bigger threat right now. Magma has seen how useful science is with their swords, so it makes sense that he wouldn't want to kill the only person that can give them a chance a surviving even if he doesn't like him"
16,"I kinda like him. After the attempt to kill gen, he's just along for the ride. Like, honestly, he took losing the grand bout better than I thought he would.     Since they've started killing characters, all that's left is killing a main character. I mean, they've already killed senku, sort of"
17,"It kind of makes sense though, if he don't take that well, he'd have did something the last time he lost to kohaku and may have gotten him banished from the village."
18,But he did do something this time. He tried to kill gen and had suika abducted. He only accepted it because he knew he wouldn't be able to fight it
19,"Tbf Gen is an outsider so their actions are within what the village acceptable levels, and they didn't even actually harm Suika to fabricate the lie."
20,I guess. He still cheated by taking a child though
21,"True. I think he's smart enough to know that he's far outclassed by Senku. Seeing him cure Ruri of what had been a guaranteed fatal disease and seeing the katana he made, I think even Magma could recognize that his best bet is listening to what Senku has to say. Especially when faced with the threat of the Tsukasa Empire."
22,In a way they also killed the guys from the ISS.
23,     I don't understand
24,"At the volcano when tsukasa snapped senkus neck. Boy was super dead, and would still be if it weren't for the bit of petrification on his neck that healed his broken neck"
25,Oh of course that's what you meant can't believe I forgot
26,"All good man, glad I could help"
27,"Yeah, but he wasn't actually dead in narrative terms. It was extremely obvious he was going to be revived straight afterward, so there was no grieving or tension for the audience."
28,"Tbh, I could see Tsukasa winning him over though."
29,     If the latest fights and episodes have told us anything it would be that this is completely false
30,"I mean, I should say at least this proves this anime   can   kill characters. Loads of anime absolutely refuse to show or say anyone died.    I had the feeling the anime wasn't afraid of death in and of itself when they broke up statues, effectively killing people, but I still wasn't entirely sold because it's still not directly killing living breathing characters who spoke. Now that they did it  and even said they died explicitly , I'm quite satisfied.    Whether they can actually kill named characters is another thing entirely, but the fact this is a shounen that can freely kills minor or background characters is a noteworthy fact. We'll have to see if they're willing to do the same to supporting or main characters, though I doubt it."
31,"Only the bad guys are allowed to kill. They won't even let the protagonists  consider  sacrificing lives. To the point that it's getting kind of annoying to me.    The only reason they're surviving is because of fucking plot armor.    They shouldn't be building cell phones, they should be building fucking ballistae to shoot those motherfuckers dead."
32,"With as much manpower as they have now it would be easy to, for example, just fabricate a few crossbows, use Gen's intel and just sneak up on Tsukasa and his men and shoot them down. There's many ways to kill people, and Senku should know a lot of them. They could also just build ""gas grenades"" from that gas and throw it at Tsukasa.    Tbh I don't know why Tsukasa even exists, or why their conflict has to be on this show-defining scale, especially if they're not going all-in on the action and brutality that would be needed to portray a ""war"" in the situation they're in.      The show should just be about Senku rebuilding society, normally, using science and eventually solving the mystery of the petrification."
33,"Is it really that noteworthy? I remember people dying as early as Dragon Ball Z as far as shounen goes. Naruto had human character deaths. Demon Sword does as well. I think Yu Yu Hakusho has as well. Maybe Bleach, Fairy Tale, and MHA don't?"
34,Well when you start your anime with the mass murder of humanity... we literally see planes falling from the sky in episode 1.
35,This anime would be the most brutal horror anime instead if we got to see all the accidents in close detail
36,I'm still waiting for when the Senku faction actually kills someone. Even against their own wishes. It'll be hard to take the show seriously until then.
37,"The anime is awfully good-natured where they avoid any direct serious approach    Literally one of the most famous meme from anime     The previous episode was just a pillow fight with extra steps with an appointment to next pillow fight    While This episode was one of the worse logic based episodes, which is the main point of the anime, slow paces to bring science back with deduction and repetition    Not even speaking abut that new entry pyrogirl that seems that besides building her torch also gased all the fucking camp to catch fire in second from one side to next one...     ;      What was the worst problem humans had in all this years?      Dying form stupid disease, infection, bad alimentation etc      What was the main point of most of the  season till now?      Cure someones stupid illness with basic antibiotics      How the first enemies are  actually  defeated?      Fucking gas -      ;      So what is this MC  his  deduction?      pHoNeS ¿     ;    ...cuz fucking sending them some pox blankets isnt the obvious deduction...    or just waiting them get sick naturally.. cuz in 3k years while they were ""sleeping"" world progressed forward together with viral and bacteria stuff...but no..that is way to mundane for the creator author...     ;    fuck this dumb episode.     thread"
38,"They can’t really wait it out. Disease existed in the Stone Age, yet tribes still waged war on each other. I’d add: the  worst  diseases, the deadly epidemics like smallpox, didn’t and couldn’t exist in the Stone Age. They made the jump to humans from farm animals once we had high enough population densities to sustain them."
39,"     Yup, she somehow swam over, made a fire with soaking wet tools, then set fire to the whole town with no one stopping her, and can manage to just instantly set wood ablaze like it's soaked in gasoline.    Then she throws her torch into the water, to jump over everyone. Then somehow appears moments later with another torch only to somehow set alight a perfect line of fire on fucking dirt, as if she had poured a neat trail of gasoline, again.    This show is just becoming more and more magic. The lack of consistent logic just makes it irritating to follow along.         SERIOUSLY. It's not to best decision even taking into account all the ways that the creation of them could go wrong.    But no, they forced to not hurt anyone to absolute absurd degrees.    You're going to be attacked by a fucking army of bloodthirsty barbarians, but you're too nice to even harm them a little? It's just fucking irritating baby bullshit.    ----    Maybe I'm just getting too old for this shounen bullshit. I watch these shows casually for dumb fun, but when they do stupid bullshit and insert pointless melodrama it's just annoying."
40,"Oh nice i meet another rarity of the  Ah, I See You're a Man of Culture As Well    yes the show got more and more ridiculous, started good kinda  but meh    brainless sheeple fan will remain brainless sheeple fan    not saying to burn the anime and make it a witch hunt for one single mistake they do but at least have the gut to criticize the dumb thing beside hailing the good things..      god but those girls weird eye still freak me even now since the time of Kanon and ppl still use that style in anime even now?!!?!?  facepalm       ;     ;    even my above comment, it had some time of awareness and illumination and reached 8 points, then fell down to -6 when a mob of triggered sheeps passed over this thread    doesn't matter the ages well that much  ppl just like to live in ignorance and cant be objective    everything is either 8+ here or below 4     ;    Even the voting system got changed so much by mods now, to have that dumb percentage  of ""did u like it or not this show?""     "
41,"I mean, teens will be teens. I was in love with SAO when it aired.    These shows aren't really made for adults, and it really shows sometimes."
42,"tbh me to.. but only for first half...and not ashamed of it    still kinda liek it now, and also liek the abridged version making fun of it    its the second half of first season got me really pissed off, dint even need to wait for internet to tell me to hate it, dissed is rly badly"
43,"I didn't hate on the second half, but it was definitely more meh for me at the time. And when the gun gale part aired I got so bored that I just forgot it was airing.    I can enjoy the first half of SAO still a bit today, but it's half nostalgia and half that the music is good."
44,Yup. Liked the first few episodes then it went downhill. But I've learned to not think about it too much.
45,"no, pox blankets kill people. senku claims hes gonna use phones to win without fighting.    yeah senku could have murdered his way to being village king and then slaughtered everyone else, but then this show wouldn't appeal to teenagers"
46,Teenagers love edgy bullshit.
47,there hasn't been a real edge show since 1997 berserk
48,I wouldn't consider Berserk all that edgy.
49,"This anime is absolutely afraid to kill characters. Generic Thug 1,2,3 aren't ""characters"". They had copy pasted personalities. I'll eat my hat is any named character dies. I bet even this Hyuga dude is just defeated non-lethally and gets converted to the kingdom of science by internet porn or potato chips or some shit."

52,RIP  Keith Flint .
53,If magma doesn't have a character development i think he would be the last guy senku would want around him.
54,Gen was trying to do something as serious as make Magma lose a competition. These dudes are just trying to conquer a village by force and dominate an entire culture and way of life... just a prank bro.
55,"Murder isn't anything new in this show, Tsukasa smashed a bunch of stone statues when he was awakened."
56,Yes but no one actually counted as murder because you can't actually relate to stone statues like you do with living breathing people.
57,Anime people are not real people. How many times we have to teach you   UN   OLD MAN.
58,He also totally killed our main character. Senku was ten billion percent dead and he's only alive now because of petrification magic.
59,"He didn't die narratively though. If you actually believed for even a second that he wasn't going to be instantly revived, then you're probably 10 years old."
60,"Science   not magic, not fantasy, science  "
61,Any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic.
62,Yeah but Senku hasn't reached that point yet.  Plus they've made it clear he'll figure out what the petrification is through science.      I think a better description would be that magic is just science too advanced for us to comprehend currently.
63,"That was one of the illogical things in this show, than again a dude punching a lion and not dying is super sketchy too.     Senku could make poison arrows and poison gas bombs. I still haven't seen anyone equipped with bows and arrows which was pretty basic weaponry for the time. He could make cross bows, piss easy to use for most people.  He can also make a catapult to siege them from afar too.     Still have no clue that the ""super primate"" dude's goal is. Without science his whole tribe is gonna die to disease, starvation or natural disasters eventually. Even basic weapon making and cloths is science. Once winter comes all the retards gonna die anyways."
64,"Tsukasa doesn't want scientific progress because he feels it is directly responsible for the class divides in society,and a corrupt society in general.So his aim is to finish the root of all this ""progress"" by killing the apex,i.e.,Senku.Tsukasa seems to have been popular in his day,so people take to him quiet easily.He instills fear through his strength but his mannerisms,as noted by Gen,make him win over a lot of other people too.His goal is to create what we would call a society of ""savages"",totally removed from any science.It is noteworthy that under anyone else,such a system would've broken down.Tsukasa's society has ""fans"",while Senku's society has people who have been won over through actions."
65,"How would he ever be able to create that if his tribe can barely survive through winter and other ailments. He basically made himself a mad king, even worse than the evils of capitalism. He already have a classes in his tribe as you see him appoint captains etc."
66,"I think you don't quiet understand how belief systems work.Anyone who agrees or subscribes to a belief,believes it to be the best possible choice.He will defend it to the end,might be even willing to die for it.The people who are ready to change their views with new evidence are very rare.In any case,you can't expect the leader founder of an opposing belief system to suddenly leave it & side with the other ideologue."
67,Once his people starts dying to sickness and the plague he will most likely change his mind.
68,"At that point, most people just start inventing excuses, like someone is poisoning our water supply, or someone is using witchcraft against us, or you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelette, or those people who died didn't have enough faith in our way of life to survive, they were weak and deserved to die."
69,they are modern people who at least have basic knowledge of sickness though
70,Guess he is the religious side anti-science side then.
71,"They don't seem to be struggling at all though. They are talented hunter gatherer's, and have the ability to make shelters. So I don't see how the winter will kill them. Also while disease would be an issue it wouldn't be nearly as big of an issue as you are saying. Because the main thing that started all of the major plagues is managing and caring for domestic animals. And the thing mostly spread them was trade and war. Look at uncontacted tribes, disease does effect them, but not that much. As the germs pests need to come from somewhere, so without outside people spreading germs it's not a big issue.    As for his grand ideas, they are obviously deeply flawed; but they do have some basis. Historically less developed societies tend to be more egalitarian over all. Because if everyone needs to work to provide the food, everyone gets a share. Although Tsukasa doesn't seem to be completely following this, as seen by the pretty girl who was lounging around."
72,"I guess that they are going more for a ""anarchic"" approach as opposed to egalitarian.    Not anarchic in the political sense of the word  after all they have a leader lol  but in the sense of a society where ""everyone does what they want and go on with that"".    That gal not doing shit maybe is just considered young and with pontential, and when she was released from the stone she didn't want to hunt as long as others are willingly to provide for her.    And anyway I have the feeling  without reading the manga  that she is supposed to be more than a random gal not doing anything.    Tsukasa made her free even she lacked the muscles of some of the other women we saw, she must be capable of doing something."
73," Sorry for the late reply, I didn't notice it until now     That was my take on it too. Because they talk about how everyone is willingly following Tsukasa. So it seems like people are mostly free to come and go, and do what they want. Juat people aren't leaving because they would probably be better off as a group. Yeah the girl seems like she will be some kind of minor villain  also haven't read the manga ."
74,Ya like making babies?
75,Someone gotta sacrifice itself.
76,I'm crediting these kills to Suika. She's now officially the deadliest person in the new world  unless you count Tsukasa smashing the stone people .
77,"I actually think somehow Suika will end up being the one that kills defeats Tsukasa, if that does happen. It's foreshadowed in the whole ""science levels the playing field"" thing"
78,Why this reminds me of game of thrones?
82,What's so horrific about it? That's just what I look like if I wake up without getting my 20 hours of sleep.
83,"Not scary at all tbh, feels really forced to me. Like they're trying to be edgy and just failing."
84,Wait for S2.
85,Sulfy-chan saves the day! Clearly best girl.
86,Hah. I like how Gen was nervous if Senku was going to make a nuke.
87, Japan- The place so nice they nuked it thrice!
88,It isn't even that hard to do. You just need a shitload of time and effort to refine all that uranium to weapons grade. A gun based design could be build by someone in their garage if they somehow got their hands on enough enriched uranium.
89,"Yeah, they just need to get some enriched uranium. Super simple stuff.    There's probably some of it lying around somewhere, next to mutated monkeys or something."
90,"""I'm sure that in 1985 they sell it in every corner drug store, but in the Stone World, it's  a little hard to come by! """
91,"Idk about enriching or refining, but actually uranium isnt hard to find. It's around you quite often, it's in soil, rock, and water. Im not sure how you would extract it and then ""enrich"" it, but at least finding the uranium itself is plausible!    Though yes I dont expect nukes anytime soon in this show. You need a pretty advanced degree of tech. Like the crafting requirement alone is a problem since it definitely couldnt be done by hand like with our master crafter in the series. You need machines involved which means we first need an energy infrastructure that also produces enough energy to even power such machines."
92,Getting Uranium from the environment into pure metal is  really easy.     The ONLY hard step is turning uranium metal into enriched uranium. That's where all the difficulties happen and why building enrichment facilities is such a big deal. The rest can be done with stone age tech.
93,"Ya I have no idea what goes into enriching but like I said, uranium's pretty much everywhere. I'm guessing whatever steps go into enrichment in those facilities require machinery though, and we are far from automated machinery in the show right now. They don't even have consistent electrical energy yet."
94, Want to be on a list? 
95,"Or, you know, your smoke detector."
96,Yeah Senku should just ask the villagers to give him all their smoke detectors so he can salvage them for enriched uranium. I'm sure he can scrape together the amount needed for a nuke from that.
97,I mean those smoke detectors are broken anyways. Just look at what happened to the village.
98,Smoke detectors have Americium in them though.
99,"Sorry I was thinking of the people who have used americium to make nuclear reactors ""at home"". I guess the point of OP was more getting  material  for a fission weapon rather than the reactor."
100,Sorry. Just wanted to point that out. I wonder if you could use Americium for fission...
101,Quora says you'd need many tens of kg of the stuff to start any useful fission.
102,Would've been a bit overkill on Senku's part though.
103,"""Gen, look at my face. For I have become Death, destroyer of worlds now""  pushes red button "
104,"It escalated from ""good morning world"" to ""goodbye world"" real quick"
105,Saraba sekai   good bye woooorld
106,GOOOD MORNING WOOOOORRLDDDD
107,"Ngl, I was disappointed when he said he wasn't going to make nukes."
108,"Not gonna lie, at first I also thought he was going to make a nuke."
109,"Finally, taiju and yuzuriha get to do something in the story again! I mean, I love the villagers, but senku spent thousands of years planning his survival plan, based off the logic that taiju would be there. And now its going to pay off. Also, what sort of crazy genius decides ""screw it, time tomake a phone""? I mean, absolutely brilliant. I wonder if its gonna be more of a radio than a phone, but either way, it's impressive."
110,"Since I can't see Senku making microchips anytime soon I'd guess it's gonna look more like a  WW2 radio , but I doubt he's gonna put up telephone cables all the way to Tsukasa so I'd go with the radio."
111,"That's what I thought but I'm pretty sure the ""roadmap"" they showed had microchips"
112,"Well and it also shows the goal to be an actual smartphone, I think it's just so the audience can better relate to what he is trying to do.    To be fair though, a microchip - aka an integrated circuit - doesn't need to be anywhere as fancy as shown on the roadmap. The first experimental microchip only had one transistor, three resistors and one capacitor on a chip the size of a pinkie. Something very much in the realm of Senku's possibilities.    However you won't be able to make anything close to even an old mobile phone with that, the chips needed for that would have components so small that they had to be manufactured in a chip factory and not by human hands."
113,"everyone could've related to a radio though, it would've seemed way more doable lol. i'm excited for the next ep, I just can't imagine how they will make this happen. obviously I don't red the manga"
114,"Fun fact : making the microphone part is the easiest part of a phone :3    Find an old stand pc microphone and open it, don't look at what serve to digitalise the signal, just the microphone part and you'll see it's quite simple."
115,"Yeah, it has got to be radio. Anything else would just be  way  too far for me to suspend my disbelief."
116,YESS im so excited to see taiju and yuzuriha again
117,I don't see how those two can act as double agents.  It was reasonable to believe they'd go along when he was the only option.  But if Tsukasa thinks they know Senku is alive there's no way he'll trust them.  And it'll be hard to go to war against Senku without letting it slip that he exists.
118,"Yeah, can't figure that one out either. Unless tsukasa tells them theyre going to war with a local tribe and that's it. But eventually they'd learn"
119,Well Tsukasa doesn't know that they know Senku is alive an he is probably not going to tell them.
120,"My thought was not ""Senku will make a phone"" it was ""Senku will commit war crimes"""
121,"Yeah, communication DOES win wars, but I'd say biological weapons are far more dangerous. Communications are benign, when bio-weapons are 100% exist only to kill"
122,"Biological weapons are scary, but they're hardly war winners. A useful tool to have in one's arsenal, but situationally useful, at best.    But communications? That wins wars. If one side had chemical and or biological weapons, and the other had radios, I'd put my money on the side that had radios. Hell, trumpets and flags would provide an advantage, though I wouldn't put it past Tsukasa to figure that one out, as well.    But radios? The ability to transmit a whisper over a distance? With the other side  not  having the ability to listen in, or even triangulate the signal? That's a big game over right there. The Fog of War is Real, and telecommunications pierces that barrier like nothing else.    What we end up with is Tsukasa and his forces blundering about, just trying to  find  Senku's forces, with any scouts they have needing to physically walk back to tell the others who he's found. Senku's forces, meanwhile, can have someone like Suika lurking in the bushes with a handset, observing the scout, transmitting his location every chance she gets, with the others setting up an ambush.    A force without telecommunications is blind and deaf to one that has it. I don't care how strong he is; he's going down."
123,"This. If you look at past conflicts, communication played the biggest role. Messenger dies? Battle lost. Message intercepted? Battle lost. If you were to time travel back to any conflict and gave one side advanced telecommunication technology that side would gain a significant advantage."
124,     FTFY
125,"Eh, just say you're ""getting messages from angels"" or whatever, find some discreet individuals to pass out cleverly disguised radios to, and win battles. Emphasis on that third bit.    Emphasis on a fourth bit, too: win the war. You lose the war,  you get burned at the stake by the other side ."
126,"Jokes on them, that's one way to get isekai'd."
127,"And here I was joking about Dr Stone episode 60 or so will feature him presenting his first smartphone. The story was faster than anticipated, though I still think it will be walky-talkies..."
128,"No Geneva Convention, no war crimes"
129,"""Senku violates the Geneva convention"""
130,Can't violate the Geneva Convention if there isn't a Geneva.
131,Also what are they gonna do? Stone him?
132,"YES!, the fucking pox blankets, or gas attack is literally the first deduction he should come to..     for noers under comments and yes its not his personality to kill ppl, but...    BUT! there are not deathly disease that are still very effective, starting from simple diarrhea to other sleepy lethargic inducing  things     but noooooo that is clearly baaaad any biochemical warfare...    we got pHoNeS idea instead  facepalm"
133,"I mean, he is trying to revive humanity without killing anyone. He could probably make mustard gas fairly easily if he wanted, but theres like 60 living humans and killing half of them isnt a great idea."
134,"read again my edit above, there are also no mortal alternatives to biochemical warfare     witch he should have logically considered first, considering the steps he took in the anime until now"
135,"The steps to make the sulfa drugs took like weeks to make, and while he could just do pox blankets and shit, but without the ability to mass manufacture the drugs, it's as good as death to get them sick. Senku says as much at the beginning of the series when talking about the soap, sickness is pretty much game over."
136,"there is sickness and there is sickness    u literally brought in the Genevra comparison  yourselves for a reason, and the dude above, cuz that was the main final deduction, but he or the author dint even mention it to discard with with some plausible reason      ;    AND i dont think you realize how big his ""phones"" like more of  radio trucks will need to be considering his tools at disposition now    And by radio trucks i mean the radio itself should be big like a radio truck... plus the antennas repeating the signal    Disease illness ? find the source of water,  go upwind, do your basic dispersal and wait, for them to contaminate themselves further between each-other passing it            ;    the ""biochemical way"" is way way way way more easy and already advanced for him"
137,"Bro, I was just making a joke cause I figured he would go that way, but in retrospect it's pretty out of character for him to do so. Plus the author likes to surprise us, idk how many of us expected he make a generator that early on. Like, biochemical warfare is the expected route, but weve been seeing the unexpected this whole time, I dont think its like bad writing or anything. Also, yeah phones is a bit of an exaggeration, hes making walkie talkies I bet, something radio like but still potentially handheld."
138,"generator was needed to separate his solution to make the antibiotic remember?    no biggie  actually, that is really easy humanity had that like in 18 century, big wheel rotating to generate some electromagnetism    All the micro tech  stuff involved in a portable radio is like   seriously impossible for him to make       ;    Like i said there is a reason why that joke worked above, cuz is a pretty direct ""hello big world"" that is the obvious thing there    And yet you backtrack it now and say it not true..meh where is your objectivity?"
139,"I have a question for you. Sure Senku could make illnesses and spread them easily and that would win the war, and even if you exclude the fact that no one would really follow Senku if he did that, there’s still a problem. How would he avoid making his own army sick. Or himself. He struggled a lot to make just a few drugs, so he can’t make enough easily enough to keep everyone safe from illness, and if he gets sick and dies it’s game over for both his dream and that world for a solid amount of years, maybe even forever looking at the lack of genetic diversity. It’s just too risky, and why would Senku keep that risk when there are easier ways to win the war, like with communication as he is planning."
140,"me: so for example he can make his enemies sick    random dude: oh so mustard  gas right gaz so how can he spray it on all of them?    me: no listen i say disease like u know simple diarrhea will do it, and etc other stuff, no mortal stuff needed    other random  dude, but killing them is bAAAAAd, so like you see how i proved to you, communication      warfare is better!    me: O M G  "
141,"Any illness if not treated could become fatal, even more so if it’s an illness that has the capability to prevent a person from fighting back. Looking further up, you suggested diarrhoea, yes? People can die from diarrhoea, as it forceably ejects water from ones system and if sustained for long periods of time can cause dehydration and therefore death. It is the cause of 1 in 9 child deaths worldwide, and kills more children worldwide than aids, malaria and measles combined. And while those numbers are for children, in this world with no easy to access medication and lack of cleanliness, it would be easy for the illness to spread and the people would not have many ways with which to fight back against it once it infects them apart from just waiting and hoping for it to end. I never mentioned any mustard gas or the like, any illness can be bad in this world, and the risk of purposefully spreading it to what we know to be the entire population of humans is quite high compared to just using communication and other science based weaponry, and maybe some other forms of tactics."
142,Senku doesn't wanna kill people.
143,"there are other option that dont kill...stil using chemical disease stuff,     and he doesn't need to make the tool for the tool of the tool to make the tools for making the phones, like now    an dis way more immediate  in delivering results with bio warfare"
144,"Like what? Tear gas? Pepper spray? Yeah that'll be effective, but not to the extent you'd think it'll be, especially when you're up against Tsukasa. And he's not making phones, he's making something more akin to a walkie talkie."
145,fracking diarrhea works fine also    u know there are hundreds of simple illness disease that debilitate you big time with some incubation period before u get simptomps?    u dont need to run and spray pepper tear gaz  like ..like u know..      ;    i mean the small pox blancket reference above should have hinted u to like u know..not tear gaz at all...
146,"First of all, speak proper English, or else this will be the end of our argument. Also, small pox blanket tactic needs time. Like, a lot of time. I can bet Senku can finish the phone faster than he can infect even 10% of Tsukasa's army. Then you also have to consider that Tsukasa isn't a complete braindead dude, he does have a ton of modern knowledge, and germ theory is one of the basis of modern medicine. Most primitive bio-warfare tactics only worked because the people lacked the knowledge to counteract against such tactics. If Senku tried to slip in infected stuff, Tsukasa would quickly catch onto that and quarantine the infected."
147,     and i stooped to read after that. its useless to speak with pretentious ppl like u    so  have a   good   bad day
148,You should really listen to him. It's really hard to read and properly understand what you're writing.
149,ok boomer
150,first comment after 1 month here deep in comments? holly smokey u got triggered a lot eh
151,I don't comment that much to begin with and I wasn't watching anime for couple of weeks.     I actually agree with what were you saying but it's hard to read so I only wanted to help but now you're acting like an asshole so fuck you.
153,"I'm not pretentious, I just want to understand your point."
154,u understood it and stop logging in alt accounts to pat ya self on the back
155,??? Alt accounts??? No I don't have any. That was another dude replying to you. Also are we gonna continue the argument or are you gonna pay yourself on the back for winning without a rebuttal?
157,"""The Science Gang Commits Genocide"""
158,"""So anyway, I started gassing..."""
159,More like ``Senku creates the new Genova convention´´
160, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia theme plays 
161,"Don't worry, gas is probably his plan B"
162,Its a genius plan      First he is gonna use the Cellphone Radio to warn the people and then he is gonna gas them      Exhibit A           This way no one can cry unfair play afterwards!
163,Probably my favorite scene from that season.
164,"You say ""that season"" as if there is more than one."
165,I mean it had a film and also Quartet happened but yeah it's still one season. Honestly it's had enough content I didn't notice until your comment
166,There’s a Dr. Stone movie??
167,Youjo Senki has a movie.
168,"I was more trying to differentiate it from the film, since I haven't watched the film yet."
169,Bonus points if he has Suika make the announcement
170,"sorry but to stop the mass-murder of roughly 4 billion people, there is literally no ""war crime"" senku could commit that isn't justified... his opponent wants to kill about half of the human population!"
171,"Tsukasa won´t manage to kill 4 billion people though. Distances on Earth are too large to manage that in a human lifetime and I think Tsukasa might at best have 30 years or so, until another strongman replaces him.  Also given their rejection of science and without Senku´s superhuman !Science skill, I doubt they would manage to even get to the other islands of Japan until the next leader figures out that they can have science and being the new elite by having the smart ones work for them."
172,"Yeah, I'm surprised it wasn't mustard or chlorine gas, tho I guess he is supposed to be the good guy."
173,Seinen spinoff of Senku that will last 10 chapters because Tsukasa got mustard gassed while he's wiping his ass with leaves.
174,My thought was the same as Gen's. When Senku started talking about building the strongest modern weapon I was wondering is using a nuke would perhaps be a bit overkill.
175,"I was thinking artillery. Sure they don't have gun powder, but explosives could be made with other material, and even if it's just say trebuchet and ballista it's still a huge range and area boon. I guess senku isn't the killing type even against someone who all but actually killed him."
176,"That face at the end, is the face of a man who knows he's fucked."
177,I love it. That face is just pure f e a r
178,This man...has the eyes of a killer           Like a certain nail gun man I know...
179," ""He already has guns!?"" "
180,It was in that moment that he knew .... he fucked up.
181,"It's either that, or the face of a man that is about ready to explode with rage. Somebody 'bout to get FUCKED up."
182,Makes me wonder what Tsukasa thought about Hyouga killing some of his soldiers. Probably not the smartest move to make.
183,"Nah, When Tsukasa revived Hyoga the way he talked about his men was as if he was talking about training dummies. Tsukasa is the kind of guy who only cares about a select few he deems important. Everyone else is just a tool for him to use. He absolutely sent those men knowing that there was a great possibility of them not coming back."
184,"""Meh. Those idiots were weak as shit. I don't even remember their names. Oh yeah Hyouga, here's a new spear for you."""
185,"I think one of the things I like about Hyouga is that we don't even know his backstory. Hell, how does Tsukasa know him? We don't know. He could be a serial killer for all we know."
186,I think he is a martial artist or something too since he talked about some style when he used his spear.
187,"Presumably if he's the ""strongest primate"" he must be competing with people for that role, so he must know the strongest people in the region country fairly well."
188,"Exactly. I don't know why everyone's acting so confused about how he's able to find muscley people and whatnot.     He has connections, and a shit ton of nutritional knowledge  much like a martial arts expert in real life would "
189,"Which matters only so far that he could recognize them when he sees them. Also these guys look more like people who work out for muscle and less like skilled martial artists. They might be his gym brothers or some moronic fans of him.     But knowing them doesn´t help in finding them. Despite his hatred of modern life he probably used urban landmarks like everyone else did, so getting to a location from his previous life would be rather difficult. Also they all lived in a large city and would be all over the place.      So having connections wouldn´t help him much, when he has to walk everywhere and search more or less at random to find these dudes.  His knowledge about proper nutrition and how to work out might help, but I wonder how much of that is applicable when the only things you have access to, is stuff within a reasonable walking distance  so several days on foot maxmum . Some stuff might be missing completely. Oh you want chicken eggs for your super buffing diet? Have you seen a chicken somewhere? Probably went extinct, without humans around they are easy prey."
190,"Now this I can agree with you on. We're supposed to accept the fact that we was able to find them in the first place and connect the dots ourselves    If anyone can find these people, it would have to be Tsukasa though, and the more people he revives, the more he has who can help him find the rest of the martial arts community and all other communities branching off from it.    So yes, it would be an absurdly difficult task, but doable. Especially by someone like Tsukasa."
191,"Consider also that this is a series where Senku actually expects to go from rocks to replicators in a single lifetime, where the old crafter dude can literally make  anything  Senku has the ability to describe, where Tsukasa  punches lions to death .    Seriously, if nothing else, that last one sets the tone. If it is even remotely  possible  that someone of a particular archetype could, under ideal conditions, do a particular thing, then it can be done in this series, with aten billion percent success rate."
192,"Tbh, he's had like 6 months, right?    He probably just wanders around like ""oh hey, I know this dude!"" And pours some shit on him."
193,Or someone just decided to put him in a cage with a gorilla and let the two of them fight it out.
194,"Tsukasa mentions when he first met Kohaku that ""She's too young to have such skill, there's no way the martial arts community wouldn't have heard of her"", implying he is a part of familiar with the people at the top of the martial arts ladder."
195,Probably nothing since Hyouga wouldn't have told him.
196,  Boss can't be angry if he doesn't find out.          chitosesmug 
197,they were too ugly so they had to die    F
198, When you realize your boss is going to make you work your ass off 
199,"It's really funny how they think Senku already made guns and gas bombs, even though he didn't"
200,Tsukasa should be worry if he thinks Senku violated the Geneva Convention by using chemical weapons...
201,Tbh it might be an interesting question. Are there really rules to war when it comes to survival of humanity in the stone age?
202,"I would say no, not unless you want to die."
203,"Yea. That's why ""Communication"" is kind of a weird answer. True, it's important, but it's not as easy to make and can't turn the tides of battle that easily    First gotta ensure your survival"
204,"I guess Senku doesn't really want to kill which seems silly, but its still Shonen after all"
205,It's the premise of the whole conflict. Tsukasa's willing to kill people who disagrees with him to achieve his ideal while Senku wanted to save every human. Kinda hypocritical if Senku just goes and kills people who he disagrees with.
206,"I dunno man, when there is a war going on where both sides are using deadly weapons and one side has no problem with killing, then I think deaths are realistically inevitable"
207,"Yea he clearly says he doesn't want to have bloodshed.  Plus from the bit we see of the Tsukasa empire it looks like there are people who don't want to be there and are being watched by guards   my interpretation anyway   so killing everyone without any info breaks his ideals.  So far he's saved absolutely everyone in any way he can, even by dying."
208,"Yeah, senku's gonna do a great job saving everyone when he's fucking dead.    This kind of plan only works when you have mega plot armor.    You don't always get the choice to save everyone. If people are an existential threat to that cause, then it's justified to kill them in order to save the most amount of people in the end.    You think the allies tried to avoid killing nazis because ""oh, they might be innocent germans who were forced into serving the military"" or ""we'd be just as bad as them if we killed people to serve our cause!""    No, they killed them for the greater good."
209,"Thats.. not the premise at all, though?    Senku wants to revive the world and restore technology.    Tsukasa thinks all the adults are corrupt and evil and reviving them would be bad because they'll just oppress everyone again. And for some reason his solution to that is to make himself king and oppress everyone, but with brute strength instead of ""science weapons"", because thats somehow better.    The only reason Senku won't kill is because ""anime ""logic"""" and he's the ""hero"". Anime hates it when ""good"" guys do the right thing. Thats why the deaths this episode are by the villains."
210,Tsukasa has a very good reason for hating adults.
211,"I'm caught up on the manga, he really doesn't imo. Even if he did, his solution of ""rich people oppression = bad, Totally Legit Young People oppression by brute strength = good"" is complete and utter nonsense. Also his weird ideas that science only exists with senku.    And the idea that even if the newly revived rich old people did try to reclaim their power, well.. how? I doubt senku is gonna give them ""science weapons"", and their will be a lot more normal people revived than rich old dudes, why would they let some useless rich guy order them around? They aren't rich in a world with no money, all their assets are long gone, and they have no useful skills.     Heck, tsukasa could just use his brute strength to stop them if they try, but otherwise leave everyone alone. Thats a much better plan than ""to stop evil rich adults from murdering everyone in their way,    we    will murder everyone in our way first, it's good when we do it right?"""

216,"He's a teenage idealist. Even setting aside his rather logical explanations for his values of winning without killing, it's only natural that a teenager would have some qualms with mass murder. Tsukasa is the weird one here."
217,"I mean, I haven't read the manga, but I assume that Senku will be able to succeed with little to no killing on his side. In a war between two sides that are both using lethal weapons, it is unrealistic for a side to achieve victory without resorting to some amount of killing; its the nature of the Shonen genre that will allow him to win while maintaining his idealism. I don't really have a problem with it beyond just thinking that its a little silly"
218,I won't comment on the  practicality  of such things. I'm just saying that it's an understandable viewpoint for him to have.
219,"Fair enough. My point was that I think its a little silly for Senku to have that viewpoint while not having it be an unrealistic goal that he has to grow out of, but I also understand that it is just an aspect of Shonen"
220,Couldn't he make sleeping gas or just mustard gas? Some thing to just knock them out and not enough to kill them.
221,"Which is why some teenager should not be in charge. The old village chief should be in charge of things with senku as his advisor.    But no, this is shounen, gotta make the kiddies feel like their naive outlook on life can be used to achieve legitimate success."
222,"Well he is a young teen after all but if he have no choice than he will kill, I guess since he is a logical guy."
223,In classical warfare the ability to instantly communicate orders would be more powerful than cannons. It allows for so much more maneuverability adaptability it's insane. ESPECIALLY against a foe who can't. It would break all conventional rules of warfare and allow for coordinated ambush attacks along multiple flanks.     One of the most common gambits historical generals used was breaking off a smaller force of your army and using it to flank your enemy. The biggest risk with this was the inability to give them orders coordinate their attacks with ease. Thus it had a huge reliance on having a competent sub-commander leading the side force. Having instant communications would've made this tactic almost unbeatable.       TLDR  : Instant communications is not a weird answer. It is 10 billion percent overpowered in the context of historical warfare which Tsukasa is pretty much forced to use.
224,thats how genghis khan became such a good conqurer     ;    he used systems to communicate orders across his army very fast
225,"It is sort of overpowered, but then again they are also fighting against people who are way more powerful fighters than them. Even with the full range of modern tactics on their hands they will still need some sort of additional weapon that can get past Tsukasa and his ability to snatch crossbow bolts out of the air while running at highway speeds and punching lions into oblivion.    RIP Tsukasa's army of chumps though, they don't have the benefit of being superhuman so they're gonna be annihilated."
226,"Yep. A soldier's greatest weapon is not his rifle or his grenades. It is his radio. Radios can be used to call for artillery fire, reinforcements, close air support and air weapons teams. America giving its squad level NCOs radios and allowing them to call for artillery strikes directly instead of waiting for an officer to do gave it an insurmountable edge during WW2 over every European force."
227,Yeah but he has no artillery. If they just come over and smash his shit there is no phone in the world helping them.
228,That's why flanking exists. You can easily overwhelm a superior force using guerilla tactics.
229,"I don't think Kohaku can overwhelm a superior force by herself, no matter how much of a gorilla she is."
230,The only superior force here is Hyouga and Tsukasa.
231,The point is he can react quickly because his scouts will inform him to move before Tsukasa's forces will ever reach him.
232,"Though for Tsukasa they're definitely going as a bunch together  because they don't have communications out of talking     But, I can see why. If Senku's team is launching an attack then it's a lot better for positioning forces, but all out against Tsukasa they'd lose"
233,"I mean if it’s 6 against 600 then yeah instant communication won’t do that much, but that’s why they’re going on the offensive. They can just nonstop ambush them on their own turf while they’re in disarray.      Obviously if senku just put the village in a line and sent them against Tsukasa’s army they’d be slaughtered, but the strength of instant communications is the lack of necessity for such simple formations. The reason doomstacks were so common was the ability to give out orders to large amounts of men at a single time. Just send them in a direction and let em go at it.     Instant communication removes that limitation. You can have 10-20 groups of combatants organized at the same time which is SIGNIFICANTLY more effective than one big force. Just have 2-3 of your 15 or so attack groups act as mobile bait splitting disorganizing Tsukasa’s force and use the others to pelt the big blob with arrows gunfire from the flanks. Tsukasa’s army would route in minutes almost guaranteed.     Granted with Senku’s numbers in the show rn that specific strategy isn’t currently viable, but it still shows the potential opportunities that instant communication creates."
234,"And with the steel swords, they already have the edge on weaponry against people with stone weapons. So getting better support technology will also help."
235,Gonna wonder how he is going to create a radio. Battery tech isn't at caveman levels.
236,"I mean they already have electricity, so it’s just a matter of getting battery acid or something similar then putting it in a container that’ll hold it.     I’m more interested in how he’s going to make plastic out of a beehive and charcoal."
237,"Or...you know...killing them when they had their guard down, like on Christmas."
238,That’s just a good way to get yourself excommunicated. You did not want to be excommunicated in medieval Europe.
239,-50 relations with   LITERALLY EVERYONE  
240,"No, but in Colonial US that totally flies. Just ask George Washington."
241,"The revolutionary war isn’t exactly what I’d call an example of classical warfare lmao.    Even then Washington was part of the English church  or was he Protestant? I don’t remember lol. , and hardly had to worry about being excommunicated. Not that being excommunicated was nearly as big a deal in the mid 18th century as it was in the 8-14th centuries anyways."
242,The Anglican Church of England is a major Protestant sect. I doubt he was a Puritan refugee though.
243,Found Senku's reddit account.
244,"The fact that he said they could win without bloodshed leads me to believe that he doesn't want to kill anyone if he doesn't have to. So by using various guerrilla tactics to make their lives hell, you can sort of force them to surrender without the need to fight, and if they surrender then you can expand the kingdom of science. Science is going to need the extra bodies afterall."
245,"     If you can preempt anything they do because you have remote communication, you have a massive advantage. They have to send messengers all this distance while you have radio communication. How's that not a good way to survive?"
246,"Especially since they have 2 double agents that can give them all the insider info.  The only fight that will be difficult will probably be Tsukasa.  Personally I thought Hyoga might switch sides but it seems not, kinda a bummer."
247,They don't have enough people to really take advantage of it.  It's not like there's formations and defensive positions where you can attack weak spots when it's like 10v30.
248, 
249,"Except there is. Good communications can easily win you wars even at an overwhelming disadvantage. Why do you think in the world wars, one of the first things the enemy would try to disrupt would be your communication devices? Because without them, your units would be as blind as a bat, and you wouldn't be able to do shit to fix it."
250,"As Sun Tzu said, divining your enemies intentions while keeping your own hidden is the key to winning war, harass the enemy and leave them no quarter, run them ragged while keeping your own forces well rested. What enables the wise sovereign and the good general  to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary  men, is foreknowledge. Hence, the use of spies."
251,Wasn't he also the guy responsible for inventing fighting and gathering up 2 of every animal onto a boat to beat them all up?
252,          you what
253,"Surrounding them and cutting them off is possible with communication and coordination.    Everyone is going to be super dangerous now because they will all have a direct link to Senku, who is the ultimate weapon."
254,"The easiest way would be just bottles of the toxic water they can be all they want but if you wanted to kill them just a few water nades can kill a ton of the army , ofcourse is not the way for senku"
255,I don't know why they aren't just making boats and sailing off somewhere that Tsukasa can't find them. It would buy them an awful lot of time to jump start technology.
256,"Except then Tsukasa will continue expanding his army to the point that he'll start searching for Senku.  On top of that making a ship takes mass amounts of work with modern technology, I doubt Senku can make a ship that can fit the entire village in the time they have before Tsukasa attacks."
257,"Given that Senku apparently has the sum of all human knowledge in his brain and the craftsman can make everything, building a few catamarans and sailing to another japanese island wouldn´t be out of the question. The village managed to whip out katanas in two days after all. The only guys who were stuck with normal human level of knowledge and ability were the poor scientists from the ISS."
258,Just because Senku knows a lot doesn't mean he has the entire sum of human knowledge.   They're exaggerating.  Besides all the knowledge ein the world can't magically make something appear.  Also the craftsman hasn't made anything that doesn't make sense so far.
259,"It is pretty close. Also have you seen what the guys has been making? Glassblowing and sword smithing are were dedicated crafts, which take some time to learn, the old dude only worked with stone and wood until Senku showed up and he managed that on the first try more or less."
260,"Except Senku studied that stuff and hence could tell the guy the info he knows.  Plus the craftsman has been making everything for the village for years.  So he had to learn how to make things well, accumulation of experience and knowledge can be used in new situations."
261,And who is going to enforce these rules. All of the UN is stone now. They are the only humans alive on the planet and their empires are the only ones that exist.      WE ARE ESSENTIALLY WITNESSING WW3 !!!!  
262,WW3    Total forces on both sides: 30 people or so
263,"Well, total human population is 60 or so.    And it is a war between the only existing human civilizations on the planet."
264,Inb4 someone broke free of the statue in the US and comes with a huge fleet of thousands of people
265,Thank God Senku has not dug up oil yet
266,
267,"Great, now I gotta watch the history of everything again..."
268,"Portugal just shows up to the village like ""I heard you needed guns?"""

Either those that called it happening before it did are psychics, who should each recurve a cool mil from the james Randi educational foundation, -OR- that mf'er was murdered, brazenly, and the powers that be didn't care"
283,"Wartime Law is really weird. If two countries Duke it out all rules apply. But just because one country says ""nevermind I'm not following rules"" doesn't mean the other can break them too. Then theres a whole other nest of worms about unlawful combatants and how you treat them.    So if you squint really hard various countries atrocities towards their own rebellious people could be justified since they're killing unlawful combatants, and their illegal weapons aren't being pointed at other countries  or countries the UN actually cares about     I'm not condoning those actions, but it's the really shitty way things work right now.     But of course, even if Senku could legalize it  neither the empire nor the kingdom are legitimate members of the UN, nor does the UN even exist any more  Senku would probably hold himself to those values anyway. If he wanted blood he could easily build siege weapons, crossbows, and gas bombs, but instead he goes for Intel and specifically mentions ""if we do it right we might not even have to kill anyone"""
284,"Well, atleast 'officially' the UN is supposed to enforce the Geneva war accords.    But we all know that it will just be an excuse for US to enter your country."
285,"Yeah like they did with Syria, Iraq, etc."
286,Well the US isn't in Syria anymore so that's a good thing I guess.
287,"Except it actually isn't. They are still there, protecting some key infrastructures  read oil  but aren't next to the border which acted as a deterrent before. Things are worse off now that the Trumpster told the trops to fall back."
288,"And the U.S., and european colonists. Pretty much guaranteed in an asymmetrical conflict."
289,"""you play nice in your war or we're going to be kinda cross with you   !"""
290,"Ha take this Einstein.      WW4 wasnt thought with spears and axes, WW3 was!"
291,that isn't a given. someone had to turn the world to stone. and if they did perhaps they had a way to unpetrify themselves.
292,Colorado Senator Steven Armstrong was getting tired of people making fun of him.
293,And being fought with sticks and stones!
294,"Sticks, stones, cell phones    The usual stuff"
295,Oh shit...He's inventing Nokia's?
296,"Well, he did say the strongest weapon mankind has invented"
297,With Senku bashing a rock onto Tsukasa head. The real DR STONE
298,"Nope. Like most things in international politics, the rules of war only really exist when there are complex geopolitical mechanisms and agreements in place to enforce them."
299,The only rule i follow is the   RULES OF NATURE   
300,They need cyborg ninjas now
301,"No? Why would there be?    Rules only work if you have someone to enforce them.    Even today, you can commit as many war crimes as you want as long as you win and push anyone who could punish you into submission.    That would mean world war for us, though."
302,I was hoping that's what they were making instead of cellphones
303,I was all in on Gen's plan.
304,"The Geneva Convention doesn't hold any power in the stone world.  Tsukasa should be shitting his pants.  Biological warfare is back on the menu, boys."
305, Comrade  of the capitalist scientist         datass 
306,"Can't wait for Tsukasa's comrades to abandon him once they see all cool stuff Senku does. Someone could call it free market choice.     not a manga reader, no idea if that actually happens "
307,"Information is just as important as troops in a war. A lot of the Art of War is about controlling what the enemy thinks is happening in various ways so they make exploitable assumptions. The example that sticks at most to me is Sun Tzu said that if you are going to overwhelmed a good bluff is to open your gates wide and to set a top the gate playing an instrument without a care, any cautious person seeing this as a trap."
308,"I love this example so much I do have to correct it a little. It wasn't actually Sun Tzu in the Art of War, it was Zhuge Liang who was purported to have done that in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Zhuge Liang was a tactical genius and the enemy commander had lost to his tricks many times before, so when they saw him out in the open playing his instrument and the gates open depicting the normal day to day life of the village folk, the commander just said fuck that and turned around.     I totally agree with the importance of information. One of my favorite scenes is in Drifters where Nobunaga gets a communication device and immediately realizes the absolute paradigm shift that would occur with real time communication between squadrons many miles away. Communication completely determines battles and was one of the biggest bottlenecks in pre-modern warfare."
309,I guess they have seen potential of senku so their fear makes them thinks so.
310, TFW your scout in Civilization stumbles finds another civilization 
311,And that civ lucked out on a village that somehow gave them lategame techs.
312,"My head cannon will now on be that whenever I find a village with tech boost, it's senkus science village."
313,"Yeah I hope someone makes a Dr Stone mod for Civ, I'd definitely use it!"
314,"Reminds me of rushing crossbow man and having it getting ancient ruins so I have a gattling gun before 500AD, this reaction is accurate for the other civs near me."
315,Dude I once got a tank during the medieval era using that strat. Talk about an easy win lmao.
316,Sometimes to relax I'll start a game on easy against one or two AI and I'll have nukes before they make it out of the medieval era.
317,And then defects to it.
318, Meanwhile on the island... 
319,"""We're going to create the strongest weapon in 2 million years of human technology""    Me: Trebuchet?    Senku: Smart Phones    Me: Oh."
320,"See, with smartphones they can Google how to make trebuchets        glasses-push "
321,"Google, the greatest tool of science."
322,"""Shit, we wanna make this, but Senku is busy."" ""It's okay, we have WikiHow."""
323,And that is how they ended up with a catapult
324,"That honestly still just annoys me how the forefathers of Ishigami village, despite the village's location supposedly being Japan  inconsistent but whatever , never thought to record any information for the future while the internet was still working.    I mean, there's a lot more I take issue with in how their society remained for 3700 years with no other tribes forming, their ""sacred stories"" remaining completely unchanged and unbroken, and no clear uprisings or other issues that could have caused its entire identity to shift...or the fact that they still speak perfectly normal Modern Japanese, for that matter.     Honestly, it's one of those things where I feel like it'd work better if it were 370 years, but that wouldn't have given an excuse for all buildings to be gone.    ALthough on that note, it feels like there are too many buildings absent. Human engineering is rather impressive, considering things like the Pyramids. I don't doubt that many iron or steel structures would degrade over 3700 years but if the Pyramids could survive the windswept sands for nearly 5,000, where exactly are all the other stone features humanity built? What about underground facilities, which may have been spared the worst of degredation?    I got on a very long side-track rant there."
325,"I mean, this whole manga  and by extension the anime  is centered on someone with a near encyclopedic knowledge of almost every branch of human sciences down to the very details, trying to rebuild human civilization after all humans on earth are turned to stone by some kind of beam light that apparently can penetrate all materials.    These premises already require a ridiculous amount of suspension of belief, to the point that I pretty much peg this show as fantasy more than science fiction; I think if you are still into the show after all that, you should be ready to just take everything at face value and stop trying to dig too deep, because there really isn't much ground for realism in this anime."
326,"native australians had stories about islands covered by the sea long time ago, they would event point to where they were, and only recently did archeologists find out that the changes in the sea level did covered some islands in the coast of Australia, exactly where the natives said they were. They have been telling those stories for some 12 thousand years. So that part at least is very believable"
327,"Pyramids were made using extremely large stones. Extremely large stones probably are harder to destroy than concrete with metal. And since metal corrodes - destroying concrete is that much easier. Also, even if they did write up everything from the internet - it's 3700 years. There is pretty much no way they could preserve information for that long. Or they could, but instead hanged around on an island and their children without navigation somehow reached Japan. Yeah, this show really doesn't make much practical sense. Because if they DID dedicate their time to preserving stuff - situation would be much better probably."
328,It shouldn't annoy you because it would be essentially impossible.     The longest lasting storage medium available on the ISS would be... paper. Which there won't be a lot of because even LEO is hideously expensive per kilogram.     Digital storage mediums only last decades at best and years at worst. Completely unsuitable for a post-apocalyptic world. To say nothing of keeping you electronics charged or replacing the batteries as they degrade.     To say nothing of how much can't be saved. I can read wikipedia to learn how a diesel engine works... but it won't teach me how to make one. Including mining and smelting the materials.
329,"There was a documentary series, Live after humans, on how fast stuff would crumble when humanity disappeared one day. It wasn´t that long for most modern stuff. Might be worth a look.    Stone buildings are more durable but still require maintenance. I think the pyramids are the exception rather than the rule.    Anyways Tsukasa´s caves have an artificial look to them. The rectagles are too regular and too perfect to be something entirely natural."
330,     The pyramids also have the advantage of being  massive .
331,"Yeah, the pyramids are a massive block stone mostly in a very stable shape, other stone buildings are still quite resilient but not on that level by far. Made of different materials, some of them more prone to crumbling. For example medieval cathedrals are quite sturdy but still require maintenance and extensive renovations. Also after the roof crumbles and windows get smashed by natural forces, the stone structure will be even more prone to wear and tear than the blocky pyramids."
332,Tsukasa has like a couple hundeds of the meatiest dudes in Japan with him. They probably moved boulders whole or carved out big chunks of the mountain.
333,"Look at their caves again It´s at 2:29. Even if they could do that, why would they do it like that? Even the floors of their home are tilted."
334,To let liquids and CO2 and other gasses flow outward?
335,"I don't get it? So you want every single anecdote and history of how the tribe formed fed to you instantly? I don't know if you got it already, but a lot of information on how the tribe formed has been kept a mystery for obvious reasons. Yes, the astronauts landed on an isolated island  hence why they had to use a boat to try to get the medicine for pneumonia . How the tribe ended up in mainland Japan just a few miles from Hakone, go figure."
336,"     That's my biggest issue with the whole thing, honestly."
337,"Here's a hint: boats. If you assume that they just showed you 100% of the history of the tribe, then you clearly can't understand the fact that the author intentionally left gaps to fill in later."
338,"If people who were far more equipped with the knowledge and understanding to operate boats died in a storm violently, how the heck are we to expect the far less-informed descendants who-knows-how-long-after to have been able to accomplish that same feat?     I'm aware it's  possible   Polynesian settlements, the settling of Japan, etc , but seems rather implausible, especially with how they are apparently so pathetic that they can't even grasp anything more complicated than wine-making."
339,Because they had thousands of years to develop. Also they aren't as pathetic as you make them to be. Kaiseki himself proves that they are indeed capable of great feats of craftsmanship.
340,"No joke, trebuchets and other siege weaponry is what I first thought we were going for."
341,I did too until he said it was really modern and then I was thinking he was gonna build planes somehow.
342,"The advanced Siege Weaponry, Airplanes!    Just drop some friggin rocks on them!"
343,"What for? Tsukasa's ""kingdom"" is basically caves and trees - what is the purpose of siege weapons? Literally a flame-thrower would be much more effective. And considering that pink bitch with ugly lips somehow but earth on fire - they already have them."
344,I noticed that too lmao. Somehow set a perfect line of fire alight on some fucking dirt. Like she carefully put down a gasoline trail.
345,The trebuchet will have its day eventually.
346,"Maybe in a few hundred years once there are enough people to actually build castles, and enough other people for the people in the castles to profitably use the castles to exploit."
347,r trebuchetmemes
348,why does this exist
349,It was a big thing a couple years back.
350,I legit thought he was going to make cannons or armour. But a phone was the lowest on my list
351,     to be honest a trebuchet will be quite useless in this stone world setting because they are so spaced and in a wood environment.    Its not like they are sieging a fortress or taking down large blocks of soldiers.
352,     You mean catapults right?    unless you want to scare Tsukasa by only hitting things near him and not actually hitting him then sure go ahead and build Trebs.
353,But what if he wants to launch a 90kg projectile from over 300 meters away?
354,It dosent really matter because if the thing he wan't to hit can move even slightly it'll miss.
355,You've now been banned from  r trebuchetmemes .  not really 
356,"Homura, the one whose name means flame, set fire to the village. Fitting name.        bookburning "
357,Looks like she was gymnast or cheerleader in her past life.
358,It's fucking Ty Lee all over again
359,"Ty Lee was Best Girl, so I don't mind this recent development here at all        datass "
360,I'll admit I definitely crushed on her a bit as a kid
361,You just made me realize Avatar came out 14 years ago. I need a drink...
362,"These scenes on the bridge is why I hate anime sometimes. Still shot of a person upside down: ""wHaT aMaZiNg MoVeMeNtS!!"""
363,Maybe somebody pointed out actual people have spines?     Something Boichi  is a bit on the fence about. 
364,It seemed like the animation took a big dive this episode.   Hopefully they are saving things up for the last few episodes.
365,"The show could really have done with a short break between cours. Ah well, shit happens."
366,They had like 1 good cut of her jumping then 3 still shots... yikes.
367,Outside of that there were shots of Ruri Kinro and Poison Gas lady that seemed really off model.
368,Also I’m ten billion percent sure Homura’s boobs changed size twice in the episode.
369,"Weird, most of the time wheter is still shots or overall quality the show seems to look really well."
370,eh i guess its hard to anime gymnastics...  but it was kind of an eyesore.
371,"Also, ""mura"" means village, so.. even more fitting name."
372,"Bitch is literally called village fire, wtf did they expect"
373, Villages aren't the only things she sets aflame         lewdgyaru 
374,That has to be the smallest nose in the history of small noses!
375,I'm new to watching dr stone so I'm reading old discussion threads. I've been struggling watching the series because the women's designs are just.. so hard to look at.     ;    But this. This is what put me over the edge.      I made a crappy  edit  because I hate it this much.
376,"Meh, constantly looks like she just sucked on a lemon tbh."
377,Perfect.
378,"Yup and also like she has Down's, like every other girl on this show."
379,I realllllllyyyyy hate her character design as well. I typically can overlook bad design but like this is ughhh
380,"Believe me when I tell you she looks better in the anime than in the manga. when I saw her I said ""wait she actually looks cute?!""    She looked like a monkey the whole time for me."
381,Almost like its Goblin slayer all over again
382,ho village
383,yo guess my name finally became useful
384,Dr Stone Homura definitely did something wrong.
385,Homura akemi did nothing wro- wait nope your right wrong show.
386,her role in pretty weird too — right hand's right hand
387,"Not really, all Captain's have a Lieutenant even if they both bow to the General."
388,and we know what people do with right hand
389,Pyra
390,I don’t like how this girl just casually has op agility. They spent all this time showing Kohaku as the main agility girl only to have this girl completely up sell her. Kohaku should have at least been able to come close to her not just be bewildered. How is a modern age girl going to have running jumping skills that a Stone Age person can’t even comprehend?
391,Olympic gymnast?

394,Maybe she was an acrobat or something?
395,"     Random kid who's good at spinning around doesn't mean she's the only one who can do it, and at no point is she set up as that. She's set up as being strong and quick on her feet more than agile."
396,"As people above pointed out, she's probably a professional cheerleader gymnast of some sort. A modern day gymnast's techniques are so unfathomably impressive that primitive people are going to think it's magic."
397,"Probably because she was a gymnast.  They clearly show that Kohaku has no idea what the movements are and they resemble gymnastics.  They haven't shown that she's faster or stronger than Kohaku, just that for the moment she's more mobile."
398,It would help if they actually fucking animated it instead of a few still shots.
399,Did you learn that meaning because of Madoka too?
400,Aye.
401,Somehow this comment gave me an urge to re-watch Flame of Recca.    Might have something to do with Homura being the name of one of the Flame Dragons.
402,Aarghh the pain in my right hand in burns.
403,Isn't there a flame of recca rewatch ongoing now?
404,It's hard to belive that there's only 5 episodes left. I hope the next season gets announced right at the end.
405,Makes me wonder how their gonna end. Because it seems like were going into a big arc and I don't know if you can fit that much into 5 episode but I don't know.
406,"If they know they are getting a second season they will probably end on a cliff hanger, like right before going into battle or something. If not they may try to rush it which I hope isn’t the case"
407,"Meh, lots of shows end with a cliffhanger even without S2 confirmation. ""Go read the source material"" is extremely common with seasonal anime."
408, coughNoGameNoLifecough      continues coughing until dying of asphyxiation 
411,They’ll probably end it when the finish making the phones to set up what comes next
414,"I’ve always assumed they were going to end at the end of this battle, it really isn’t all that long and ends on what would be a pretty decent cliffhanger."
415,"I have no doubt that there will be a second season, so I will not even care if they don't announce it right away."
416,Does the manga really have enough content for another two-cour season?
417,"There are currently 129 chapters, as I'm still not reading it I cannot say how much they have adapted, but I'm fairly sure that they haven't adapted half of it."
418,"At one point I was caught up and it only had like one and a half arcs after the Tsukasa Empire arc, I think. I guess maybe it could do two cours, but then there definitely wouldn't be material for a third season."
419,couldn't they do what mha has been doing. the menga always stays about 1 season ahead worth of content? the trade off means we will have to wait til late 2020 for a second season.
420,I'm just gonna binge the manga afterwards lol
421,Legit imagine not doing this
422,"I refuse, I was reading the manga as it came out and stopped at chapter 19  around when they first got to the village  because I knew it was so good it was going to get an anime so I waited."
423,thats quite literally the opposite of what im doing for most shows. I didn't watch no guns life until i read what i had manga wise
424,"hell yeah, i've even got all the physical copies"
425,Same
426,"Pff, I already caught up episodes ago. It's so good."
427,Nooo
428,Hoping next season will have a bit better animation due to lot of action
429,"Having read the manga, I'm  really  hoping we get a season 2."
432,"Remember that they sold about 600 BD in total recently, I honestly doubt it will get another season, even tho I want it myself."
433," FUCK YEAH THEY ARE BACK     From Japanese Katanas and Primitive Chinese Powder guns to fucking cellphones in a single episode . KNowing Senku, i wouldn't be surprised ifhe actually managed to do it, considered he made fucking antibiotics with stone world technology.    Did Tsukasa went to the nearbiest prision facility to unstone people?  His soldiers look like and act like a bunch of rapists from generic hentais.      Also, Tsukasa looks fucking scary. "
434,The  put all stat points in STR and VIT
435,"Not sure why Senku's calling them cellphones. Unless he's also planning to build a tower and a switching system, they're basically just walkie talkies.    Excuse me, I misspoke. THEY'RE MOTHERFUCKING WALKIE TALKIES. Senku is right; this technology alone can win the war for them, even if they were still limited to stone spears. With radios, swords, and BOWS  seriously, why haven't I seen any of those yet? That's the first thing I'd try to figure out how to build , the war is basically over before it's begun. Like beating up a blind deaf person."
436,senku actually used a crossbow back in episode 3. Don't know why we haven't seen any since...
437,Maybe we haven’t seen it because Tsukasa can grab arrows in mid-flight
438,Can't grab 30 at once.
439,I just hope the cell phone process doesnt drag on as long as making the Sulfa Drug did
440,"Not gonna spoil anything, but it is a lot faster. They have most of the stuff they need, so they mostly just need to build phone things"
441,The Ugly Bastard Brigade.
442," Fucking finally!         woo     Now to make cellphones... yeah, I'd be right there with Gen laughing, how the fuck?"
443,Taiju definitely asked Yuzuhira to make that cape for him because he thought it looked cool. She succeeded.
444,Taiju trying to get other the fact that he's not the main protagonist of the story        rinkek 
445,"""YUZUUUUUUU! Make me a cape!""    ""...Taiju we are supposed to take this spy stuff seriously.""    ""Yuzu, wouldn't it be so cool if I had a cape and I would look so much cooler then Tsukasa-    ""You want a consolation prize for being replaced as protagonist?""    ""Please and thank you""  Runs away  "
446,"If they're going to be spies it's better to just act naturally anyway instead of being weirdly serious. Therefore, make that cape!"
447,Senku's hair is some YuGiOh level main protagonist shit.
448,Find the stand user   stone age edition  
449,Senku in general reminds me a lot of season 0 Yami Yugi
450,Still best bro
451,I don't know either but believe in the willpower of the shounen protagonist who can do the impossible and see the invisible        faito 
452,ROW ROW FIGHT TSUKASA
453, this is the drug that will pierce the heavens 
454,Can he touch the untouchable and break the unbreakable too?
455,"     So now that Tsukasa knows that Senku is alive, why would he trust them in any way or let them stay in the village  ? or even alive?    Sure they left Senku more than 6 months ago, but since they literally ran off with his ""corpse"" shouldn't it be obvious that they knew he is alive and are lying for a reasonable amount of stuff?"
456,"I feel like this is the kind of show that would just gloss over that fact, seeing as how they made Magma change character so fast with hardly any transition"
457,"Magma didn't change. He's defending the village because HE FUCKING LIVES THERE like how's that so confusing?  This isn't directed at you specifically, but everyone "
458,"I wasn't referring to right now, I meant even at the episode where Senku cried, Magma went from ""I'll kill Ruri"" to docile drinking with everyone like it's no big deal"
459,"What else would he do though? He lost the bout, that's done and done. Now they're service drinks, might as well join in, right? Just because he wants to kill someone doesn't mean he's gonna respond to everything with ""I'm gonna kill someone now"""
460,"No I meant, everyone is just hunky-dory about him after he's been very antagonistic this whole time. I just felt it could've been handled better instead of how they did it, because the transition felt very jarring"
461,"You said he ""changed character"", which makes it sound like you're saying his personality changed.    That aside, it just says a lot about the main cast. They don't feel the need to hate someone if they're not going to be an issue. It's not like the show is telling us that what Magma did was ok"
462,Senku has to make a radio or walkie talkie right? iMessage or Gmail would be a crazier move.
463,He's going to create an IRC chatroom.
464,I'm guessing its going to be something closer to a WW1 radio.
465,"I mean, at first he said ""smartphone"" but then said ""Ok, not actually a smartphone but a regular cellphone"" so...        yuishrug "
466,And by cellphone he probably means old school walkie talkie ... because cellphones require cellphone  towers  and there's no way they are going to be doing anything that requires huge amounts of infrastructure in enemy territory lol.
467,"Gen be like ""Tsukasa-chaaaaan I know you don't want to see me but I came to setup some wifi towers here, don't worry I'll give you the password"""
468,"Not to mention that if they tried making something that relies on a cell tower, it would become an obvious target, increase build time, and not give a lot of benefits seeing as the whole area they need to operate in should be in walkie talkie range anyway."
469,If ends up being a satellite phone then - assuming the satellites are still in orbit  I don't know if they would be  - it means they wouldn't have to worry about range and long-term would be more useful I suppose
470,"After 3700 years I seriously doubt there are still any satellites still in orbit. They would have run out of the propellant needed to keep their orbit or run into a myriad of other potential problems  space debris hitting them,systems malfunction,ecc . IIRC most satellites have an expected operational life of 10-15 years.    Even if there were any satellites still active they would be useless since Senku doesn't have anything capable to run something resembling a computer program nor would he have any idea of what software is required to interface with those satellites."
471,not really     satellites in geostationary orbits will be fine mostly as long as space debris didnt get to them
472," Read the ""3700"" years thing. Dude, even nowadays around 1 satellite is destroyed per year due to space debris collisions. A problem that will and is getting exponentially worse due to a destroyed satellite generating even more space debris in a process known as ""Kessler Syndrome"". There is a 0 percent chance that any intact satellites would remain after such a long period of time without any maintenance, much less any functioning ones."
473,"Yes. But he is talking about Geostationary Orbits which are super far out. Thats where you can find our entire GPS and Communication Systems. In all likelyhood, a good portion of those would be fine. They wouldn't work because of old age, but they would be in-tact. Meanwhile all the closer in satellites, their orbits would have degraded and they would have either fell into the planet, crashed into one another, or hit debris.    Granted, even if they did still work, they would be mostly useless as:       GPS Satellites just spit out numbers signaling where they are in their orbit. You would need accurate maps to get any use out of them.    Communications Satellites would use very specific protocols for encrypting and relaying communication. Protocols which Senku would need to perfectly reproduce, and then hack into the satellites to change the encryption keys for"
474," There's space debris in geosynchronous geostationary orbit. In-fact, there's a good amount of it in a nice ring where geosynchronous satellites are. Just search up a map of Earth's space debris, it's everywhere, and that's just the stuff large enough to be tracked.      So, no, there's no chance that any satellites would've survived. Remember, as more and more satellites get destroyed more and more debris would accumulate exponentially, heavily increasing the chances of more satellite impact.      Also, no orbit is perfect or permanent. There's not just the earth's gravity affecting those satellites, there's the moon for example, which is getting ever-further away from earth and as it does it's gravity will alter the orbits of any other objects in earth orbit, pulling them outward and destabilizing their orbits. Not to mention the Earth's less than circular orbit around the sun would cause the sun's gravity to shift any satellite orbits as well.      So even if they did somehow avoid any collision, 3700 years of gravitational shifting from other celestial bodies would cause their ""perfect"" geostationary orbits to degrade and either fling themselves out into space or fall back to earth."
475,"Even if we assume the orbit was perfectly stable and there was no space debris.     3700 years is long enough for RTGs to deplete, electrical components to wear out, and solar panels to get shot to shit by dust and particles."
476,wow thank you the more we know yeah it does seem like even if it was still in orbit it wouldnt be functioning anymore
477,"We saw something falling off space while Senku's dad was alive, no way they are still up there 3700 years later."
478,"That was the ISS, which is in  really  low orbit, and so fell faster. Other satellites would have stayed up as long as they had fuel to correct themselves. After a few millennia, they'll definitely all have had system failure, or crashed into something though."
479,"Yeah but if the ISS crashed within 20 years, everything else probably fell out of the orbit in 3700 years"
480,The ISS is in a very low orbit which means it experiences way higher atmospheric drag than stuff that's higher up  like the GPS satellites . Satellites in low orbit require station keeping  basically boosting their orbits to compensate for the drag  but satellites in higher orbits like that could stay in place for millenia or longer. Nothing would work anymore because no electronic device is going to just run without maintenance for 3700 years but lots of satellites would still be up there.
481,"They still might be up there, but there's zero to no chance that they are still on"
482,Satellites nowadays are kept in low enough the orbit will deteriorate over time.
483,"Yeah, like...I guess I work in the field so it's far more obvious to me but think about what it would take to make a ""smartphone"". Just the software side alone...    What he's gonna make is likely going to be more akin to a CB Radio or Walkie-Talkie."
484,"Look Chrome, I invented a simple processor and programmed it directly.     We now use this device to build more elaborate processors and program them in low level languages so we can got high level languages.      Now we just use this super PC which has 10 Billion times more calculation power than a rock and implement this Networkstack. But I keep getting this weird Error message so I am gonna checkout Stackoverflow and...      FUCK Chrome we are fucked without it"
485,     Well you are not wrong.         Well maybe he should have spared some of that time working on the rocket on learning about debugging and such.
486,10 billion times zero is still zero    Poor Senku.
487,Man how the heck do you make a transistor from scratch?
488,"A vacuum tube 'transistor' seems within Senku's and the village capabilities though, they even are in the road map I think."
489,"vacuum tube, right there on the road map."
490,"You don’t. Look at that route map: it’s got vacuum tubes on it. Those are nature’s transistors!     well, not really nature... you get my point "
491,"The hardest part will be the transmitter, but receivers are much easier to implement.  You only require a coil, an antenna, a headset, and a diode.     The antenna and coil can be made with copper.    The headset requires a small magnet glued to a flexible membrane  leather or cork can work, if you coat it with resin .     The most difficult thing will be the diode, but if you can't isolate and process crystaline silicon to make a diode, you can use a vacuum diode, also known as a  Fleming valve .    The problem with vacuum diodes is their energy requirement, and if you don't have a tungsten filament you'll have to use carbon. And using carbon means that your diode can blow up. This could become a plot point later  unless Senku creates more than one vacuum tube for emergencies .    As for the transmitter, you require a transformer,  Senku can use iron for the transformer core and copper for the coils , a small battery  this will be one of the interesting parts of the episode, I presume , and an oscillator. I suppose most of the episode will be manufacturing the oscillator. Since it requires to be low power, using vacuum tubes will be the hardest part, but perhaps Senku can replace the oscillator with a mechanical equivalent: A tiny AC current generator using a hand crank and a series of spoked wheels. It'd be like building a motor, but in the inverse. The problem is that you'd require a very precise machinery to reach the desired frequency. But who knows, Senku might surprise me and create a low-powered triode for the oscillator, who knows?     Oh, and a capacitor. Making capacitors would be a fun episode; two metallic plaques separated by an isolator material.    Okay, I'm getting excited. Can't wait for the next two episodes."
492,"Rather than a transistor, you can go for a triode, the precursor to a transistor: It more or less looks like a giant light bulb. It doesn't seem particularly difficult to make by hand so long as you know what you're doing."
493,Yep which is why a triode was on the roadmap to building the phone. The phone itself will likely just be basically a walky talky though and will just use the vacuum tube to amplify the signal it receives from the antenna like any other radio.
494,It's on the roadmap of SCIENCE.
495,"That would be rather difficult, you could do it with fairly precise chemical reactions to saturate silicon with trace elements in certain parts of the silicon, but they would likely be about the size of a pencil eraser at the smallest given Senku’s tool at the moment. I’m assuming that he will rather make something more akin to a walkie talkie with multiple communication channels, which can easily be achieved using analog electronics  no transistors or diodes needed "
496,"Guess you're right, there's no need to make a transistor when its only function is communication. Well regular phone as we know it do many more than communications hahah. This would be closer to a backpack telephone I guess."
497,"I also doubted Senku in the first 9 episodes when he said he was going to make antibiotics.    But this mad lad actually managed to make it, and as well as eletricity and gas maks, on a fucking stone world.    So i'm not surprised."
498,"Making electricity is pretty simple, anything that can actually   use   electricity is a right pain in the ass though."
499,"Depends on what you're making. Electric motors can be made using just a battery and a paper clip, for example. Electric heating just requires running some electricity through wires that don't need to be isolated from the atmosphere. Electromagnets are just a coiled wire.    Now if you were going for more modern technology like computers, then yes that is going to be difficult, but there are plenty of very simple uses of electricity too."
500,gonna create smart phones     then flappy birds and watch the downfall of humanity
501,"""Senku we stopped getting updates on the enemy""      ""Huh, guess I shouldnt have added this Gaccha game"""
502,"Cellphones is a bit of an exaggeration, but it is entirely possible to have some form of electronic communication technology built in the stone world. I mean the first basic phone was invented in 1849, so as long as you have the materials and electricity, it's probably not as hard as they make it seem."
503,"Yup yup my reaction was very similar to Gen's as well. I can barely change batteries in a remote controller  overexaggerating but still  and he is going to put up a cell phone somehow... how... don't you need like radio waves for it to work? Where the frick is he going to find all the minerals  in stones probably but the fact that he memorised which ones are in which is unbelievable. like heck . And like the construction of a cellphone requires very small, precise elements, wonder how are they going to make it.     ;    I'm as excited as ever, but heck, it really sounds crazy"
504,Right? I missed best bro and his waifu so much.
505,"     They were missing a whole year of publication in the manga, I remember that moment had me really happy when it happened."
506,Giving me flashbacks to the coconut radio on Gilligan's Island.
507,I love how at the end of each episode is an epic closing scene.
508,"Wouldn't Tsukasa realize that Taiju and Yuzuriha are traitors? Like I assume when they joined his villiage, he probably asked them if Senkuu is really dead.    Ending has me hyped though! Loved seeing Tsukasa's reaction to the news about Senkuu being alive.    Have mixed emotions about seeing another ""road map"". It's cool seeing how they build things, but that also means that is probably all we will be seeing for the next 4ish episodes. Which gets a little boring IMO."
509,"They are in a rush this time though, so maybe not. I like that aspect of the series though"
510,"He'll realize it, he'll halo realize that its better to keep them alive and hostage because they're a huge weakness for Senku"
511,"I actually love that format, I enjoy the episodes when they’re getting all the aspects of the invention together. I think the road map is fun and cool way to depict what’s going to be happening in the next couple episodes."
512,"   Stitches!       Homura        Hyogo & Homura        Tsukasa        Even the women in Tsukasa's camp are ripped!  Is Tsukasa's base nearby an old boybuilders club or something?      Looks like the Scientific Kingdom isn't the only one that has blondes      Seeing Tsukasa interact with his people was great!  It really shows how charismatic the guy is.     This made me sad.  If only Senku and Tsukasa met before the petrification, they definitely would've been friends.      For a second there I thought Hyoga was going to offer his services.  He was just using himself and those thugs as a distraction.     So Tsukasa found an arsonist?  Although looking at what she did to reach the village, I'm guessing outdoor survival is her specialty?     Thank fuck Kohaku got to Suika just in time.       And I love hos smug Senku was with his gas mask xD      We finally have our first non-petrified person related death.  Assuming of course Tsukasa didn't kill anyone with his bare hands while he was building his empire.     The look on Gen's face really says that he would actually believe Senku if Senku said he has nukes xD      Smartphone!?  Why not just go for regular handheld radios? I'm with Gen here, out of all his plans, this is the one I am most skeptical about.     FUCKING FINALLY!  Taiju and Yuzuriha! Yes! I miss these two already! I was hoping they'd show us during that flashback in Tsukasa's camp but I guess they're saving their appearance for a big moment."
513,"I love that Senku took time out just to shit talk Hyogo while he was stuck in a tree. I'm all for respect and honor but seeing the protagonist call their foe a huge scrub is pretty nice, too."
514,Tsukasa got that PTSD look down pretty well        ptsd 
515,"With the plan for a cellphone, my guess is that maybe cellphones have a longer range than a radio?"
516,"Nah, cellphones are mostly reliant on communicating with radio towers that forward the signal to other radio towers  each radio tower being considered a ""cell"", thus the name  and so on until it reaches the target. Without the infrastructure the range is nothing special compared to other remote communication tools."
517,not without cellphone towers
518,"Actually it's the other way around. A cellphone itself is only capable of transmitting a few kilometers and can only communicate further because it connects to a tower that then transmits the signal over a cable.    For radio signals, a lower frequency will travel further and is less affected by noise than a high frequency signal but a higher frequency signal will be able to carry more data.    A modern cellphone uses the frequencies between  850 and 1,900 MHz for which the 850 MHz band has a range of about 5 km. Compare this to long wave radio  frequencies below 300 kHz  for which has hobbyists have received signals from over 17,000 km  11,000 mi  away. The downside to longwave is that their longer wavelength means that they need a larger antenna to receive the signal.     The most practical implementation would probably be to make a basic  Crystal Radio  using the medium wave spectra assuming they can generate enough power for the more demanding sender. Otherwise they have to make an amplifier but could then use less power for the transmitters."
519,not really. The range of cellphones and radios depends more on the infrastructure they are built on rather than the devices itself  although a larger antenna helps a lot too .
520,Gen's reactions to Senku's next wild  re inventions are the best.
521,"     Maybe, but I feel their viewpoint and goals after being petrified are too different and would not have changed. It would have resulted in a more dramatic split between the two of them though.         Cell phones would allow for a more tactical use for Yuzuriha and Taiju. A radio would need to be on and manned to make sure information is passed, this makes discovery by Tsukasa more likely. But will a cell, Senku can text  assuming he adds that feature, which is likely  and Taiju  but more likely Yuzuriha  can view the text or make a call from a safer location so as not to be discovered.         My mind immediately went there as well XD"
522,Got a stich of Senku presenting the phone and the timeline of inventions?
523,Looks like New Episodes got delayed for one hour and will be now releasing on 12:30 AM on Frydays.
524,Thanks I was waiting
525,It seems to be because of Daylight Saving Time. The japanese broadcast time remained the same iirc.
526,"Yeah, I just don't get why Crunchyroll chooses to delay their shows though, as Funimation just post them ""earlier"" in other words at the same time they did before the Daylight Saving Time started."
527,     Makes sense. Thanks for claryfing.
528,Oh ok
529,getting a new roadmap is sincerely the most fun part of the series for me. just how the fuck do you intend to make this crazy shit? I can't wait for next week. They better announce season 2 already!
530,"probably along the lines of ""hey Chrome had all the shit we needed in his shed"""
531,"When Senku said “The most powerful weapon, i totally thought he meant bioweaponry.    I don’t think anyone imagined him saying a smartphone..."
532,"Bio weapons are kind of shit, mostly because they just kill the enemy and you indiscriminately. Also they’re pretty old. In the Middle Ages there’s been cases of people throwing plague ridden bodies with catapults inside city walls to cause an epidemic."
533,Why use catapults when you have the superior trebuchet?
534,I thought about bio-weaponry too but then I remembered this show refuses to let the good guys kill the bad guys
535,hot air baloon and bombarding the tsukasa empire with white phosporus
536,Yes!  Best  actually saved the day today. Last week I was not being serious when I hoping for Senku to made something with sulfur. Thankfully he didn't need to do a thing as she when out of her way to bring death to everyone herself!    Although I was honestly surprised by that second part of the attack. Now I can't wait to see how Senku will make those  rustic .     I wonder why he didn't go for a two-way radio first?
537,"I mean, you can't really make a full fledged phone with what Senku has. He's probably gonna just make a radio and pass it off as a phone."
538,its missing the battery and they also need a way to secretly charge for longer missions
539,The battery is right there  in the right corner .
540,"oh, nice"
541,Do you have the 1st road map?
542,Yeah.  Here you .
543,"noice, thanks"
544,"Copper, coal, charcoal, and... beehive????    Produces plastic????????    who the fuck made this crafting recipe lol 0 10 minecraft is better"
545,"Humans did. And Boi, this is Minecraft."
546,     Senku did said that he will make a regular phone and smartphone is kinda useless at the moment. I agree that a radio walkie talkie would make the most sense at the moment though.
547,"I suspect when he says cell phone he means radio. Especially considering the ""Comms HQ"" sequence"
548,"Yeah, I think calling it “smartphone” is a move for younger readers viewers who might find it a more intuitive image than walkie-talkies."
549,"I think he's probably going to make a radio tbh.  If he was going to make a telephone system, he'd either need to waste manpower in an exchange, or build a computer.  I expect that he'll eventually make a thermionic valve computer, but it seems like a bad idea to try it in a hurry."
550,I can see him using a villager as an operator just for this specific battle
551,"It's not that I think Senku is averse to using manpower or anything, it's just that the focused, one-to-one communication of a phone doesn't really have any benefit over using a tunable radio in their current situation."
552,There are two civilizations with less than 100 people.    And they are in a war.    This says a lot about our humanity.
553,Not really. Ants go to war. There's been a famous recorded horrific war between two tribes of chimpanzees. Conflict in nature is unavoidable and as such war tends to happen whenever there is conflict between larger groups.

563,"Hello pet peeve my old fiend    I saw a slideshow scene again    While Homura is tumbling    Sound effects of air whistling    ""What are those moves?"" Kohaku asked    Money and time is what they lacked"
564,I don't feel like Tsukasa is really instilling the values that will change what society will turn into. Primitive humans were always might makes right.    Just need one strong but evil person at the top and it all goes to shit. Nevermind actively rejecting science is gonna lead to them all dying at like 50.
565,"Primitive humans mostly weren’t like that at all, that’s Tsukasa’s mistake. Ishigami village strikes me as a more believable primitive community: mostly based around cooperation, the chief’s just there as an advisor and coordinator of sorts. Power emerges from consensus. It took bigger, more structured societies for absolute kings to appear; Tsukasa is a Bronze Age ruler in a Stone Age setting."
566,"Tsukasa is honestly my only real gripe with the show. His vision has always felt somewhat weak and shortsighted. He wants to avoid the inequality of the old world and only revive the young to make a better more compassionate world, cool I get that. But the only way to do that is making sure science cant exist? Questionable. If he was only ever supposed to be a super beefy blockhead then fine he's meant to be dumb so his reasoning is gonna be dumb, but he's supposed to be at least moderately intelligent according to senku yet he apparently either doesn't realize or give a shit that one bad flu outbreak would completely destroy his entire empire."
567,An even bigger issue might be pregnancy.  I know that girl doesn't like paying her rent but she's going to like it even worse when she dies of child birth.
568,Just gotta revive some 15 year old doctors.
569,holy mackerel. I hadn't even considered THAT angle of his society.
570,"that's the dumb thing about his society, with kids, i am still not convinced about those goons, but the things about science is that knowledge work hand in hand too.     Just like senku, just because he has super science, doesnt mean shit when he isnt able to implement them, craftman like that old man, they are the one who make senku theory into practical.     But this is something that will be missing if all you revive are kids."
571,"You know, if someone told me they'd build cellphones in a Modern Stone Age setting, I'd ask them how high they were. But considering this is Senku, it wouldn't surprise me if they just created unmanned drones at this point."
572,"Its not a question of ""how"" but a question of ""when"""
573,"Sulfur-chan made a cameo! Wasn't expecting to see best girl again.    I didn't expect that Gen would become the group's straight man, as he's the only one who really understands how ridiculous Senku's goal is."
574,"I really don't think discount Kars empire can sustain themselfs with just hunter gatherers and so many people. They either need to stay moving to find food or start farming ASAP, because it doesn't look like they are stokpilling food for winter and that wil bite them in the ass."
575,"What's with homura going all acrobatics in the midst of everyone trying to attack her. We definitely need a background on her lol.     It's so sad that there's only 5 episodes left. Out of all the series I am watching this season, only Dr. stone is the one for which I eagerly wait every week. It's going to be painful while waiting for the 2nd season which I hope gets announced soon if not at the end of the last episode."
576,"did anyone felt that this episode and the previous one felt off?. feels like it was rushed and was so monotone... cant explain what is it, like it felt cheap in a way, it remind me of OPM season 2 kind of problems.    i dont know, it just didnt feel like dr.stone kind of quality, it felt like a filler writing of boruto."
577,"Felt that too, especially when Suika gets spotted by the Tsukasa soldiers and the scenery completely changes. That was weird."
578,I though I was having seizure.
579,"It felt super rushed. For me the village burning should have been the cliffhanger from the last episode, and then things should have slowly worked to introduce Homura, etc. I think they rushed through it to avoid animating everything because it was mostly slideshows. I like this show a lot and I don't want to see it become cheap like this !"
580,"That Hyoga may be a twig compared to the rest of them but his fruits are slippery. And we finally get some sight into the Primal Empire that Kraven is building.      Go figure the new pink girl would have skills like a circus acrobat. She reminds me of Gandrayda from Metroid Prime 3 with all her cold ruthlessness, acrobatics, and yeah her pink color scheme. The Dark Templar and the Circus Lady. Such interesting adversaries.      Sulfuric Undine came back. Was not expecting that to make a return.      And Senku is about to make a long distance call to arms for Taiju and Yuzriha. Time for them to accept the charges."
581,Gen's face when he is talking shit cracks me up every time!
582,"I'm excited to see Yuzuriha and Taiju again!!    But I'm scared of two things:     Now that Tsukasa knows Senku is alive, what if he interrogates those two and finds out that they knew and kills them. Or what if he assumes they knew then kills them.    Even worse, I'm scared that they turned against Senku. Unlikely to happen but that would be so sad."
583,"Liked that this episode kept at a pretty tight pace and there are some things in this episode that really worked long term. Having that conversation with Hyouga and Tsukasa while not completely interesting since we already kinda got the idea of what Tsukasa wants to do, it's interesting to see how people 100% believe in what Tsukasa has to say. Also, seeing Sukia being brave is always awesome. At least Sulfurina got to finally makes up for not killing Senku and Chrome with killing those idiots.    I don't know why but Homura has somehow become my least favorite character within the span of one episode. I don't know why but just seeing her burn down the village, evade Kinro and Khoaku and even try to destroy Chrome's shack without as much as a smile just makes me angry. Just seeing her indifferent to everything she's doing pisses me off."
584,"Ah yes, it's a true mystery as to why one would dislike someone who tries to burn down a village of innocent civilians"
585,"Gen is us, we are Gen with that face. I can't even comprehend, how does this show deliver so good every god damm episode. Finally those two make appearance after so long."
586,I hope everyone is prepared for the invention of the iStone soon!
587,"Senku: We don't have ""batshit"" for gunpowder. So we make cell phones instead."
588,"""Greatest weapon that won millions of wars.""     ;    Breaking the supply line?     ;    ""Communications.""     ;    I guess breaking the supply line would be inhumane."
589,"Technically that would be an strategy, not a weapon. An strategy that good communications make much easier to implement."
590,Good communication makes breaking supply lines easier.
591,"Yes, that's what I said."
592,Senku’s planning to wage guerrilla warfare basically so that’s what the communications are for.
593,I'm pretty sure Senku does not plan on causing a cave in to cut off Tskasa's access to new men.
594,I kinda thought the editing wasn’t as good in this episode tbh. Does that turn me off from the show? Hell no! Shits still good and the bad editing was only like 5 min worth
595,"this episode and the previous one felt off... is like jc staff from opm season 2 took over. the awkward fight animation and the pacing was weird, like it didnt feel like the tone of previous episodes."
596,I didn’t really notice the pacing was weird last episode I was just so excited they made Japanese katanas man! But for real tho jc staff needs to do better. Atleast we have danmachi
597,is it actually possible to make a communications device like that? dont you need a computer to encrypt the data being sent out to be legible
598,"i don't think so, you encrypt the data to be  il legible.    the data you input is really just a bunch of vibrations in air.    you can translate that into vibrations in a radio wave, send those out, translate them back and bam, you got communication."
599,"Correction: not air, the em field. Vibrations in air are just... sound."
600,"Corrected from ""send out"" to ""input""."
601,You only need encryption if the enemy has radios too and can intercept your messages.
602,You can encript and decode morse code manually though
603,"You only need to encrypt data if the other side has the ability to listen in... ie, they also have radios. Tsukasa will not. I feel like maybe there's either a translation issue or perhaps a generational issue in Senku's description of what he's making here. He's not making ""smartphones""  he says so, himself . Heck, he's not even making cellphones, unless he's planning to set up a tower and switching, which would be needlessly complicated, and Senku's already shown, with the swords, that he doesn't do needlessly complicated  two folds, rather than however many is traditional .    No, he's gotta be making plain old analogue radios."
604,Man I so wish senku said mustard gas instead of smartphones.
605,Are we just going to ignore that Suika almost wracked up a body count?
606,Well as long as Senku's phone will have a headphone jack
607,"I loved the last arc, but I'm finding with this arc that this show really doesn't do battle shounen very well. The animation is extremely lacking  still shots everywhere , which is fine when they're just doing comedy gags and science experiments, but it doesn't serve combat scenes well at all. The pacing of this episode in particular is all over the place, and the battle shounen cliches  refusing to hurt or kill enemies, telling the enemy your plans during combat  make the smart main character look like an idiot.    I'm hoping that the final few episodes will go back to the science and the comedy so that we can finish on a strong note."
608,Battle shounen was never the strong suite of Dr.Stone anyways.
609,This right here.
610,"Tsukasa is literally thanos, in terms of intentions LOL"
611,except he picks who he kills
612,"Well Thanos is quite generic, Tsukasa and like a thousand other antagonists who came before old prune chin have done the same shtick."
613,I wonder how Ruri and co. are gonna get out of there without the bridge
614,are we finally gonna see taiju and yuzuriha again???
615,This episode was a bit over the top. Burning down the village was unnecessary since it doesn't look like it will effect the story.  And having the co leader kill all three of his men also seemed unnecessary. Plus were supposed to complete a cellphone in 5 episodes.
616,"Does not feel like Senku should have time to build anything massive, why would not evil long hair man attack immediately, the village is burned down by pink kohaku and every day he waits senku gets better stuff"
617,They know he won't send people because he's under the impression they have loads of weapons and losing people in this STONE WARUDO is a no go.
618,"and why would waiting be better? than they will just have even more weapons and losing people is for sure not an issue in this stone warudo for his side as he just frees more, for senku on the other hand losing people is massive, SO if anything its even more worth for him to send people as if they die, e.g 10 of his men to kill of 1 senku its easily worth it for him"
619,It just failed. Didn't Senkuu explain Tsukasa would figure out they can't make more nitric acid for gunpowder making it useless in large numbers. Also spoilers.
620,"What?     Yes he explained he knows, which means it makes even more sense for Tsukasa to attack before senku can go beyond needing nitrite acid"
621,Tsukasa wants to overwhelm the village. Anything more powerful cannot be used right outside the village for fear of casualties on both sides. Like Sulfy-chan. If they were to rush the village Senkuu wouldn't be able to use it in the village vicinity.
622,Again...why does Tsukasa care about casualties
623,Because he's not evil. If he were to lose anyone it's not for shenanigans and jokes.
624,"the guy who just smashed someones end right away, yeah not evil     Hes clearly evil and nothing so far has shown that he values these goons life at all"
625,"I'm not going to spoil you, I already said too much."
626,"he is clearly shown as evil now do, and yes u should not argue from a manga knowledge point, nothing in the anime points to him caring about his goons and so on"
627,"Even as an anime only viewer like myself, it's clear he isn't evil. You're making a assumptions about him that nothing we've seen indicate. You're just projecting your opinion of him instead.         Nothing in the anime points to him NOT caring about then either. We have, however, seen that he's built a functional society with living accommodations, hunting parties, and stable resources. His people seem happy, and appear to be living good lives thus far. His military is effectively brutish but obedient, saving him the need for a US Military-style bootcamp brainwashing. Nothing about his society seems unlawful or oppressive from what we've seen. Based on his explicitly stated views, which you've ignored, he cares a great deal about humanity and its course, which logically extended to his people.    Don't get me wrong, he's still a murderer. But he's killing people for what he believes is right, not to enrich himself personally. To him, society was rotten and he's protecting humanity by not allowing the societal elites and the abuse of technology that created them. This isn't conjecture. He's expressly stated this.     He and Senku are literally no different than heads of opening countries with opposing worldviews. Just because your views align with one doesn't make the other evil. It's fine to think his wrong, it's fine to point out that he's killed people, it's fine to point out that he's views are regressive, but that's no different than any other government in world history."
628,The guy that just killed an innocent man the first thing he did?      Hes evil.
629,I love the part where you made zero attempt to refute anything I said.
630,I love the part where you ignored what I wrote and pretended that I did not refute you.
631,"You didn't refute anything. You literally made a statement and didn't support it. But I'll go ahead and refute your point some more.    From his POV, Senku is evil. Senku is trying to bring back oppression, greed, and the rule of the elites. Senku wants injustice and inequality back, which is the direct result of a world of science. It's the inevitable end to humanity, but he cares more about science than the well-being of society. That's pretty evil. Only someone evil would want that. Therefore Senku is evil and should die.     See how subjective it is?"
632,"Senku does not want injustice and inequality back, its not a direct result of science."
633,"Senku may not want it back, but he's going to bring it back regardless. Senku cares more about science than society. That's Tsukasa's while point. Therefore, Senku is evil.     It's easy to call something evil when you're looking from the opposite perspective and applying your personal values to it, as though you're somehow objectively right."
634,e what?      Science is not evil by itself.
635,"You're missing my point. To Tsukasa, the reintroduction of modern science and the revival of the elites will bring about everything that was bad about the modern world. Senku doesn't care about that, only about science. Senku's reckless disregard for the consequences of his scientific endeavors will bring about bad things, therefore Senku is evil.     Evil is fairly subjective, as is good. To Tsukasa, Senku is evil and Tsukasa is good. Killing people can be either, depending on why it was done.     There are debatably objective measures of evil. Cruelty, abuse, and oppression, for example. We've not seen those from his kingdom.     It's really, really easy to disagree with Tsukasa's actions and vilify him. Most rational people would say what he's doing is wrong. Wrong and evil aren't the same thing though."
636,"He is one of those retards of ""ends justify the means"" and enjoys a very flexible morality. Just like how he didn't want to kill Senku, he won't kill anyone he doesn't have to  obviously ""adults"" don't qualify here . And yes, it is stupdi but very human too."
637,"still evil.     And yes he is willing to kill what he has to, sacrificing your pawns to kill your enemy makes sense for the greater good, His moral should for sure allow him to send in the goons to die killing of senku so he can save mankind,."
638,"Like I said, he is kind of a sentimentalist. But don't be confused, he is ready to sacrifice his pawns if he has to, the problem is that he doens't have that many pawns yet and un-petrifying them takes time. For now he will try to find ouot more about Senku's resources before proceeding  remember that the development of any weapon of science will take a longer time than gathering info on Senku will ."
639,"yes,.,.I am not confsued that is what I am saying, so I got no idea why u are commenting back here to me telling me how he would sac them when is what I am saying he would."
640,You were complaining that Tsukasa cares about casualties and that he should be a cold-hearted machine taht doesnot care about how many of his men die. I'm saying that he does care about casualties and will try other ventures before using human-wave tactics.
641,Ye clearly is not caring about and ur comment before this is u agreeing...
642,"           ;         These are literally the comments  yours  that started this ""debate"". You are asking why Tsukasa isn't sending human waves to overwhelm Senku and I explained why. I never agreed with you, just pointed out taht while he is ready to do that he  doesn't want  to."
643,"      so he is willing and wants to do that as a tactic, case closed u do agree with me"
644,But that's not what you were saying.    Learn to express yourself properly if that's what you wanted to say in the first place.
645,But it's true though the ends justify the means. Sacrifice the few for the many that is the only true path.
646,"Yes but in this case he isn't doing it for the good of the many, soooo...      Also, in general people who use that justification are just spouting bullshit not to admit they are doing something bad or, if it is a character in fiction, to make them less edgy  and fail when they instead end up looking  more  edgy ."
647,They will de-petrify more people and simply overwhelm Senku with numbers.
648,numbers are less and less worth the better weapon he has.
649,"I also remember Drifters having scenes where they said how pivotal communication was for warfare but instead of phones, they used magical crystal balls."
650,"I really don't understand how everyone seems to take it for granted that Tsukasa isn't going to suspect Taiju and Yuzuriha of shenanigans now that he knows Senku is actually alive. That guy is paranoid to the max, I don't see why he wouldn't just lock them up just to be safe."
651,"Look, I get that he's trying to score more of a political scientific victory instead of killing anyone but cellphones just seem ridiculous  I know that's kinda the point but still . Regardless of communication giving them an edge they still have no real deterrents, only bluffs. Like why not invest a little bit of time in gathering some chemicals which you can mix together and go boom, I know it's simplistic but no foot soldier in their right mind would side with Tsukasa against grenades or something."
652,"he literally cannot make gunpowder which only has like 3 ingredients because he cant access the bat cave, and making other explosive stuff would probably need a way bigger roadmap. even if they only have bluffs, if he actually can make communications tech, he can just avoid tsukasa from the start because he'd know whether or not he was attacking."
653,"Dude it's been like idk, 12? eps since we saw Taiju and Yuzuriha. So hyped to see them again, loved Taiju as a character, seeing him makes me feel less homesick for Senku if u get what I mean"
654,WE'RE GONNA SEE TAIJU AND YUZURIHA AGAIN! FINALLY!
655,Wat was that ost woh
656,damn how are they gonna have time to make phones lol?!
657,For sure thought senku was alluding to Napalm or some other type of chemical warfare.
658,"Jesus, pink hair is one ugly fuck."
659,"You know a couple of those revived by Tsukasa are adults, i wonder what his actual criteria is for people being old or young, hell his right hand man is clearly corrupt!"
660,"If people's average life expectancy in Japan is around 80, then being 20 or 30 is still young, I don't think he ever said he only wants teenagers to live"
661,"I've been glowing about this series in general, but the cheap-ass animation in this episode is pretty unforgivable. It was practically a slideshow during the action setpieces. They could have just voice-acted the manga pages and it would have read better what was going on."
662,"The action setpieces were mostly anime-only filler, hence the reason why it looked poor."
663,"If you're going to make anime-only filler, you still have to do it well."
664,"I gotta be honest, I'm a tad frustrated with the anime community, especially lately when it comes to this show.    People on Reddit act like they hate when shows spell out things for you, as if you aren't smart enough to read between the lines sometimes, but most of you have proven time and time again that, to put it bluntly, you still need your hand held.    Most of the criticism I see is a result of people not understand things. I'm not even just talking about the cellphone rants, although people not paying the fuck attention, then immediately go on a rant about ""why is he making cellphones"" rant before making sure  spoiler alert, he DOES NOT plan to make that kind of phone! He literally says it himself if you were paying attention . No, that's already bad enough, but surprisingly that's the least ignorant and short sighted ""criticism"" I've seen so far.    Let's talk about Tsukasa. When he gave us tiny but important details of his backstory, and then a few short sentences that help you figure out his motivations on your own, so many people jumped to conclusions at a million miles an hour.    ""Tsakasa doesn't like science""    Bitch, where?    What he's against is the world immediately regressing back to the way it was. It's obvious that scientific advancement will begin at some point, but if it's jump-started and blazed through immediately with Senku's superhuman ability, then the old people in power will definitely try to go back to their lives of luxury.    Anyone who doesn't live under a rock knows damn well that the 1% doesn't give a shit about the environment and how their actions affect everyone else, so long as they get to keep their absurd amount of money that they'll never spend, and get their swimming pools of cocaine.     They are above the law. Do you think that the current president, assuming he really is a rapist, will ever be punished for it? Of course not. Did Epstein kill himself? Fuck no.    ""Tsukasa is a communist""    You probably assumed I was a communist too. Before you type your ""acktyually"" essays about how communism is flawed yadda yadda, let me remind you that not favoring capitalism in it's current state in the us is not automatically ""communist"". It's almost as if there are more than two ways of thinking, is there?    ""Tsukasa's plan will not work in the long term because if we know anything from history-""    Lemme stop you right there. Do you even know Tsukasa's long term plan? NO. MOTHERFUCKER, YOU DO NOT.    You keep talking about how Tsukasa is ruling by force, how he isn't taking into account the issues that come with his kingdom expanding.     Buddy, Tsukasa never said a damn thing about that, but he's shown that he's intelligent. Do you actually think it never crossed his mind? You're just making assumptions, and deciding based on those assumptions that ""the whole premise is stupid"". Honestly, it exhausts me seeing all these stupid fucking rants about Tsukasa that are filled to the brim with random bullshit that refuses to acknowledge that it's just SPECULATION. Not only speculation, but speculation that would be out of character for Tsukasa in the first place. Have you been watching this show?    ""How is Tsukasa conveinyently able to find all these muscular teenagers?""    First of all, some of these people could be in their early twenties you dumb fuck. How in the shit has this never occured to you?    ALSO    Tsukasa is in the martial arts community. Of course he knows about these people, for fucks sake. It's implied heavily that he has connections. But I guess you missed that, didn't you? I guess you really do need a JoJo style narrator explaining Tsukasa's background in detail instead of paying attention to the dialogue and his mannerisms. He's very much like a skilled martial artist in real life, down to the instinctual and dominant way he carries himself.    Now let's talk about Senku.    ""Why won't he just use gas weapons?! He's so naive and idealistic for not wanting to kill people!""    Believe it or not, not everyone is an edgy, anime watching nerd who has so little human interaction that they'd kill someone they seem an ""enemy"" without a second thought  if their twig ass even had the ability anyway .     People aren't just ""evil"" for opposing you, and everyone has value even before you know who they are. Senku did not go into the village like ""listen idiots, I have more value than you because logic and knawledge so do as I say"".     He enjoys the company of other people and understands that he can only get so far without the strengths of everyone else.    Being nice to Suika, despite her being just an average child, had huuuge positive consequences. Things would've turned out much differently in the long run if Senku didn't treat everyone as an equal.    Do you think him using poison to wipe out large portions of Tsukasa's army is a good idea in the long run, even if he wins the war? Just because you win a war doesn't mean your actions and the consequences of those actions are erased. Anyone capable of thinking long term knows this. This isn't a ""we beat the bad guys we win the end"" story.         Let's talk about Magma    ""I find it strange that he's just listening now. That's pretty unrealistic. I think he's gonna join Tsukasa's army that would make more sense.""    Oh my god. Buddy, HE HAS LIVED IN ISHIGAMI VILLAGE HIS WHOLE LIFE. WHY THE FUCK WOULD HE NOT DEFEND IT. WHY THE FUCK WOULD HE BE SO SALTY ABOUT THE GRAND BOUT THAT HE LEAVES EVERYONE HE'S EVER KNOWN TO GO ON A MURDERING RAMPAGE WITH SOME STRANGER WHO HAS IDEALS YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND BEVAUSE YOU HAVE NO FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR IT. FUCK.    Would you pack your shit and leave the town you live in because you lost an... Anime tournament or some shit to some other nerd? So you can fight side by side with some strong dude? No? Doesn't make sense, does it?      Okay, last example. Why are people mad about Homuraz calling it an ""asspull""?    Acrobats exist. There's no reason Tsukasa wouldn't know a few.     ""Why can't Kohaku kill her easily?""    Isn't the main point of the whole fucking show that everyone has something unique to bring to the table? Homura can't fight, but she can evade and be slippery, and set fires when you aren't paying attention.    Yeah, Kohaku can kick her ass, but she'll have to catch her first. It's the same as her being able to kill Hyoga if he didn't have his spear, or how Kinro can beat magma as long as he has glasses. Why is this suddenly different?    For fuck sake people. Stop trying to sound like a big brained intellectual and pay the fuck attention."
665,"Sir, this is a Wendy's"
666,Skskskskakagfjajjdjzn omfg   
667,Your  comment went from reasonable to cringy real fucking quick. Are you 12?
668,"It's definitely a bit cringey, but I get where they're coming from. The  r anime community isn't always the brightest bunch, and the majority are incapable of any degree of analysis beyond surface level, as though they've never been asked to discuss literature in school. Obviously the community is made up of many people, but as in most things, the loudest tend to be the least informed.     Usually I just leave the sub when I get to the point where I want to write a ranting wall of text, but I understand their frustration with some of the comments around here.      r anime: Where anything flawed is awful, anything derivative should be burned, where we want sequels and claim they ruined everything, and metaphors may as well not exist.    And yes, I realize this sounds equally  r iamverysmart"
669,Is this a new copypasta? I feel like it could work as a new copypasta.
670,"I second this, it has to be one now there's just too much potential."
671,To be fair you need a really high IQ to appreciate Dr Stone.
672,You need some sunlight bro
673,Bro do you want me to send a picture bro? I get plenty of sunlight and go out often. I'm everything the nerdy loner redditor wishes they were bro. I have at least two people lined up to bang me irl
674,     Your left and right hand don't count.
675,Fuck! Well there goes my evening
676,"Nice try commie scum. You're the one that sounds like an edgy teenager with his  r iamverysmart attitude. You fail to realize that senkus big sciency words don't really mwan anything. You shouldn't believe what ""science"" people and their journals."
677,"Drats, foiled again by the heroic Patriot! Blast his ability to see through my dastardly deeds!"
678,"The ""muscly teens"" bit is more about the jab at the artstyle and not Tsukasa himself. Of course he has young adults part of his crew, that hot blonde says she pays rent. She's more than likely in her mid twenties. The issue people take is that these ""young people"" Tsukasa recruited as the rank and file seem like they walked out of Hokuto no Ken."
679,This show just gets better and better every week I think! And the 2 day 1's are coming back aw snap. Can't wait til next weeks episode!
682,That was INTENSE!
683,Can't wait for the yellow boi. Tsukasa have a lot of powerful allies
684,"So, ya remember that meme where Senku makes an iPhone for Dr Stone episode 99?"
685,Tsukasa's face was fearsome af.  The anime is so bombastic right now
686,"I never understood Tsukasa's motivations. Even if he can create a kingdom filled with young people, what stops them from advancing science after he dies? What about the good science like medicine, better tools, ways to harvest more food etc?    Maybe he can stave it off during his lifetime by being a cruel tyrant, killing anyone that makes use of too much science, but what happens after that?"
687,Senku said the exact same thing when he met Chrome.    Tsukasa's obviously not thinking in the long term.
688,"Funnier still is that Tsukasa is a hypocrite who accepts SOME science - bridges, fire, basket-weaving, clothes-making..."
689,"He's never been against all science, he's only against weapons created through science since they're the only things that can threaten him."
690,good episodes but i still don't know if communication will help them because no one is strong enough to take on  Tsukasa in the first place.
691,"Yeah ,smartphones! Smartphones would be nice to have!"
692,"I thought Senku would go full Rimworld and commit war crimes to get their organs...        Oh well,on another moment shall be..."
693,Why don't they just build a ship and sail to China... No risk and they would be able to build up in peace.
694,"that's gonna take a while to get the entire population there, and what if there's a disaster where they all fall?"
695,Senku should use siege engines
696,This show reminds me of those Alchemy mobile games where you combine elements to create new shit which can be combined to create even more advanced shit.
698,"Honestly, I wonder how someone like Lelouch would have fared in this show"
699,"Oh man, there's only 5 eps left? This will be the biggest cliffhanger from season 1 to season 2, if you know what I mean with the people who've read the Manga. There's probably not enough time to show what they're going to do with the new technology. This show and Manga is so good."
700,holy crap these discussions come out the day it releases and im stuck on vrv and too broke to afford premium so i cant do the discussion because fml. thanks for reminding me today is friday and episode 18 is available tho
701,You pay for anime?     Lol
702,No I'm saying to watch the episode that comes out on that day I would have to pay. I would love watching the newer episodes of anime for free
703,Just waiting for senku to implement some mustard gas now
704,I just can't stop laughing at how retarded and stupid tsukasa side of the conflict is. It's actually hilarious lmao
705,"Suika made good use of the Joestar Secret Technique.    ""NIGERUNDAYO!"""
706,"Didn't the bad guys wait for a rainstorm to attack in the last episode so that Senku's guns wouldn't work?  It couldn't have been more that a few minutes between the episodes, so the huts and stuff would be all wet.   They wouldn't be able to set fire to the village if that was the case, especially with rudimentary techniques.    I don't usually care too much about continuity errors like that, but this one kind of bugged me since this show is about science."
707,"A storm gathered, but it never actually started raining as far as I can tell. That's why they didn't call BS on his fake gun."
708,"I hate this show so fucking much! You cannot say ""cellphone"" and then end the god damn episode! That's not a cliffhanger! That's emotional abuse! Stop it, Dr. Stone!"
709,Taiju and Yuzuriha seem like cool new characters! Can't wait to meet them!
710,Tsukasa and his army of Fist of the North Star men
711,"Im really liking this show a lot but I cant help but notice how much the animation quality has been lower and lower, the scene with homura doing flips over everyone was especially noticeable and not a good look."
712,True. Hope they fix it on the Blue-Rays.
713,Is it just me or does Homura look a lot like Darya? Their hair and mouths were very similar
714,maybe she is their daughter before they went to space?
715,That could definitely be it. I was thinking something along those lines
716,"How would this plan work, after Tsukasa finds out senku is alive wouldn't he just use taiju and yuzuriha as hostages??? And it would be pretty easy too."
717,"Am i the only one that thinks every minute of Tsukasa and his baboons are wasted minutes?  I'd rather have had Senku and the village surviving against dangerous new wildlife  evolution and stuff  and climbing up the science roadmap, instead of the worlds strongest hi ler and his jojo-youth.   Tsukasa is such an incredibly dumb, boring and OTT character, in an otherwise really grounded and well written Show.  The first episodes and the last 2 have easily been the worst episodes of the show for me.    That being said, i still enjoy the show, i just feel these antagonists waste a lot of potential of the premise."
718,Tsukasa's no more absurd than Senku is for having memorized the specific details of every field of science engineering and still perfectly remembering them after spending 3700 years awake counting the seconds.
719,"I know the new OP and ED have been out for several episodes, but man are they just good.  Like how it is foreboding but also hopeful."
720,"Is it bad that I actually agree with Tsukasa? Maybe minus the killing thing, his goal is absolutely right."
721,"Nope, it just means you're paying attention  to the world, not the show . This is one of those frustrating but all too common situations where one side has the right grievances but the wrong methods, and the other side could have the methods if they gave a shit about the grievances. It's how the real world works, really; the left has the right idea, but the right has a near monopoly on the economic knowledge to actually do something about it... they just don't care. The belief that the wealth of the rich is a just reward for their accomplishments, and the poverty of the poor a just punishment for their deficiencies, is widespread, and serves their interests, therefore they don't challenge it, despite the fact that  their own literature  points out how it's not really the case.    If I were there, I'd be attempting to broker a peace between the two sides. I'd try to convince Senku that while I, too, would like to see a return of modern conveniences, Tsukasa's grievances have merit, and that it is possible to return those modern conveniences while also setting things up such that the horrors of the old world do not return. I'd also try to convince Tsukasa that while his grievances have merit, that without the boost that Senku's talents could bring, we will all be dead before we can really put the necessary institutions in place to prevent history from repeating itself. Tsukasa's actions would merely delay the return of the modern world, not prevent it.    Unfortunately, I'd be willing to bet that Senku would be too tunnel visioned and confident in his own victory to see sense, particularly if acknowledging that sense means acknowledging the knowledge of a specialist outside his own area whose expertise does  not  directly help his goals. After all, why negotiate when victory is assured?  Never mind the long history of defeated peoples who nevertheless continued causing problems long after they were conquered; Senku is not a historian, not outside the history of the sciences, anyway .    Thus, I would have to support Tsukasa. Given the choice between living in an aboriginal state, and working to bring back a world of capitalism, I choose the aboriginal state. Really, everyone in that world should have that choice, and institutions should be established to preserve that choice. But I doubt either Tsukasa or Senku would be willing to allow that. Tsukasa only understands the danger Senku represents, and Senku is heedless of it."
722,"even if you kill everyone in power and science right now, the fact is this:    when you die, there will be people born like that, and they will undo your actions unless they are somehow constantly prevented from doing so.    if the people born in stone but passionate in science start making things and you kill them off for doing so, that's a form of oppression by power in itself.    This hypocrisy done by Tsukasa without realizing it makes him such a shitbag to the point where he feels like a minor character to me."
723,We live in a society
725,I'm not a fan of these high school kids being able to outwit and outfight humans who've adapted to survive the wilderness in a society that fights to determine the next head of it's clan. Even Chrome should be strong enough to take on a human from the modern age.
726,"Tsukasa really pisses me off. I'm a far left lunatic, but Tsukasa's whole belief system makes no damn sense. He believes modern society to be bad, mostly because of rich old people. Therefore he wants to only bring back young people, and create a better world. And this makes a degree of sense. Most older people are more shaped by the capitalist ideology than the youth. If you bring boomers back first, they'll obviously try to reconstruct a boomer society. So it makes sense to revive young people, and construct a better society before reviving the elders, if ever.    But Tsukasa's actions are not coherent with any sort of ideology. He leads in an authoritarian manner, which will keep hierarchies alive and well in his new world. That will just lead to the same unjust systems he critiques. Unless he suddenly embraces technology, he can only guarantee that people will obey any rules he sets down for 2, maybe 3 generations. Within 30, anything he teaches will be firmly in the realm of folklore and myth.     He's also brought back a bunch of people who are perfectly fine with taking children hostage, and burning entire villages. What sort of society will they construct, once Tsukasa's dead? Probably not a just one. And that's why Tsukasa is so irritating; he's a rare left-wing character in media, but all of his arguments are completely at ends with his actions."
727,"I think the problem is, he's a boxer, not a political scientist. He knows the sort of society he wants to create, but that does not mean he understands the best way to achieve it. He is strong enough that he can lead by force of arms, and for now, that's good enough for him because he can hold the society he wants together with his bare hands. Will that be stable? No, but for now, it looks how he wants it to look, and that's all that matters to him.    It is worth pointing out from a political science perspective, he's more aligned with real world communists than he is with real world socialists. He's ""left"" in an anti-capitalist sense, but not in a civil-libertarian sense. He would not align with real world western ""left leaning"" political groups, he would align with third world autocrats."
728,I'm just excited to see how Senku is going to start making communication devices. Also still waiting for a glimpse of Taiju and Yuzuriha.    Also I've been meaning to ask who was the girl in red dress in Tsukasa Empire when the two men came with a wild boar. That scene was interesting.
729,"Seems like the anime isn't doing so well, judging by the animation quality this episode. Sucks since this particular chapter has some  amazing ."
730,"""We don't want adults to be in charge so let's attack the village led by a high school kid"" : : "
731,Well I'm like a sucker waiting for the translation into  Belarussian
732,"This episode was nuts. Damn, I really want to see the 'regular' phone he talks about. My first question was what about electricity? Batteries make sense but going through the entire flow chart and the battle in just 5 episodes looks like a daunting task. Hope they don't leave it on a really bad cliff hanger."
733,Want to see taiji again tbh
734,They dropped so many bombs in the last few minutes jesus    Tsukasa's reaction and the reappearance of Yuzuriha and Taiju made my day
735,"When Senku said ""The most powerful weapon in human history"" I was like 'wait, you're gonna fucking nuke them?' then Gen immediately said the exact same thing"
736,I want to google all the kinds of things that senku should make. But I dont want to end up on some kind of list
737,"I don't get how tsukada says he wants to build without adults, yet literally revived the biker gangs from fist of the North Star when they're clearly over 30."
738,Its anime. Teenagers look like that all the time
739,fair i suppose
740,I like this Homura significantly less than the one from Madoka. :P
741,What chaper does episode 19 land on the manga? I wanna read ahead : 
742,guys are looking what video the commercial   
743,"I kinda wish the antagonists were more fleshed out. The captains are one dimensional uncaring characters, and the henchmen are laughably stereotypical douchebags. I care more about them progressing from primitive to modern tech then i do about fighting some one dimensional super-humans. If Senku wanted to he could kill them with a sneeze and a dirty blanket. Hell crossbows alone would deal with this problem in two seconds if there weren't super-beings on the other side."
744,Senku could build some Acid bomb as they have a pool full of it nearby.    Still wonder how they'll make phone as no way they can produce circuit board?
745,RIP the Fist of the North Star mobs ; ;     Those beautiful shining souls died all too soon ; ;
746,looks like Tsukasa will never have Senku's number.     ba-dum-tss 
747,"Tsukasa's ideology is really interesting, but I like how Chrome has shown you can never stop progress."
748,i was expecting senku to propose hot air balloon and white phosporus bombardment but then i realized this isn't a seinen show
749,why not do morse code that seems easier and faster  considering it was invented first .
750,"A telegraph would still need a device that can send and receive radio waves, that's probably going to be the bulk of the work.    Besides Taiju and Yuzuriha probably don't know any Morse code, making a standard phone would be much more convenient."
751,"man, i wonder how does the author comes up with all of this.    he must be a huge science-nerd with a lot of imagination and knack of storytelling."
752,"Both Boichi and Inagaki does a shitton of scientific research for Dr. Stone. Also Boichi just loves drawing technology related stuff. Go read up one of his previous works, Hotel: Since A.D. 2079 for example."
753,gonna give it a try later.    thanks
754,"Let me know what you thought about it, it's my all-time favourite one-shot manga."
755,Suika for MVP

758,"Hey Senku, quick thing, there's no such thing as a Geneva Convention so why not go ahead and use mother nature's weapons. She won't mind.     Otherwise, them aiming to create phones instead of actual weapons, seems ridiculous. How are you going to stop the LION-PUNCHER with a phone?!"
759,"Just showing them that the kingdom of science has phones would be enough for some of them to defect, which would be the best solution for Senku."
760,"I think this is the episode which finally hammered in how scared this show story is to show violence.    That and the animation  or lack of it  of Homura dodging, weird sense of positioning. A really poor episode."
761,How are Taiju and Yuzuriha “inside agents” now that Tsukasa knows that Senku is alive? Isn’t he gonna assume that they also knew and played doubled agent the whole time?
762,"If they do know, and you keep tabs on them, then they pose no danger.    If they don't know, and you try to imprison them or kick them out of the village, they'll know Senku is alive and join him.    If you kill them, well, you just lost any chance at using them as hostages.    So the smart thing to do would be to pretend nothing's different, and keep them under secret 24 7 surveillance."
763,"I honestly don't understand why he's jumping to cellphones. Wouldn't  field radios be easier to create? It still serves the same purpose but is more primitive and probably doesn't require the stuff a cellphone does...unless that IS what he's making and he just calls them phones.    Also, future prediction:    Tsukasa after losing a major battle: How were they able to beat us so easily?    Senku: Hehehe...do you guys not have phones?"
764,"That's one thing I don't like about Senku, he exaggerates or outright lies about his inventions.    Like with the sulfa drugs, he went on for months about how the sulfas are an unbeatable cure-all and that they would 10 billion% cure Ruri's illness  which he didn't even know what it was , only after they're completed does he bother to tell anyone that the thing he kept calling ""cure-all"" can't really cure everything."
765,Would they really be as amped to help if he started listing what it can't cure?
766,Sekuu just sold you on the idea. What you saw on the roadmap is not the final product.
767,Yeah but people  the audience  know what radios are.
768,You're an optimist for thinking kids know how radios can be used.
769,"Not how they are used, what they actually are. Cars still have radios. You can still find a radio in a store. Even phones can have radio tuners built in."
770,And all of those use 1 way communication. Let's just agree communication over large distances and phone is a match made in heaven. Enjoy the rest of the series.
771,"I find it pretty funny some anime onlies are already losing their marbles over cellphones, just wait till he makes..."
772,"The squirrel fell out of the tree. That means tress should've been no refuge and Suika should've been dead first, no?    Hyoga is a moron for knocking all 3 musclebrains to the ground at once. So he was out of canaries just like that, so how did he know when it was safe to come down? Did he and ninja girl jump across treetops all the way home?    Given Senku's imagery for instant communication warfare showed a basic radio communicator  i.e. walky-talky , I have no idea why he's calling it a cellphone. Or any kind of phone for that matter."
773,"Shouldn’t Hyoga knocked the red-shirts off one at a time, so he has extra chances to know when the gas thinned out?    Radios and telephones were around before plastic and computers. Senku should go for more basic two-way radios.     Why would Tsukasa not neutralize Taiju and Yuzuriha right away?"
774,"Even with radios, the village has less than 10 fighters. No way they’ll be able to take down the empire without improved weapons as well"
775,Senku gonna fucking build the Sibyl system
776,Phone? not a Radio?!
777,"I want Senku to make a water gun and shoot the acid as a weapon, but that would be too easy right?"
778,These episodes go by way too fast
779,Did not expect cell phones lmao    I hate waiting a week for this amazing show
780,"Smartphones?  Really?  They have a fully functional chemistry lab.  In the time it takes Senkuu to make a smartphone from scratch I can cook up several extremely deadly poison gasses, and the craftsman can make several dozen gas masks.  I feel like Senkuu is trying to find the longest most difficult way to defeat his enemy."
781,"The look of shock on Tsukasa's face on the end was the best. He knows he done goofed. The only person that can destroy him is still alive and building science. I love Senku so much, always reliable and the guy you can always root for!"
782,"Information and Communication are the key to win a war. It does make sense and is applied to games if we are to compare it nerd-talk. In games, mechanical skill or crazy reaction time doesn't win you most of the time but information about the enemy or the game consistently wins you the game."
783,Shudders in siege
784,"Weapons win battles, logistics win wars."
785,Spent the first half of the episode sweating bullets thinking to myself “please don’t tell me they’re gonna gas the little melon girl to death”
786,The only way Tsukasa can keep control is if there is no alternative to his rule.    He wants a world where only he is in complete control and it has little to do with with his grandiose ideas about the old world being corrupt. There are plenty of older people who were not in power and were just as much out of luck as young folk.    Tsukasa is nuts and his people will see that soon when they compare his rule to the Ishigami village.
787,"Tsukasa and his followers totally remind me of some real life people who divide everyone into ""oppressors"" and ""victims of oppression"" based on superficial traits, without realizing that all kinds of people can live underprivileged lives"
788,"Pretty much. He likes to dress himself up as being noble, but at the end of the day he was just jealous of other people being the ""haves"" and decided to take it all for himself."
789,"To true. I was born without much of anything no wealth or anything. Yet I was able to get an education, get a good job and pay for my mortgage. It says alot about the  millenial generations these days who can't even buy their own goddamn house when I was able to do so when I was their age. The generation Tsukasa is a part of seems entitled."
790,"Ok Boomer    Nevermind the fact that the cost of property has skyrocketed with average wages not being able to keep pace. Nevermind the fact that a college education doesn't guarantee you a decent job with a livable wage.     ""Millennials are entitled"" fuck off with this bullshit."
791,Breaking Hyoga's spear wasn't very   cash money   proper of you.
792,lol Tsukasa knows he's fucked just by the look on this face
793,"Pacing and Animation kinda feel off but hey we gonna make some smartphones next!. I like how excited grandpa Kaseki is, hope he lives long enough to go to outer space"
794,Source material and music still carrying this show
795,They should just make hentai and try a cultural victory.
796,"Why does Tsukasa even keep Taiju and Yuzuriha around? Now he knows Senku's alive they're  obviously  spies. Even before he knew, he had to have been incredibly suspicious of them and if he lets them know anything about his battle plans he's a downright fucking moron."
797,"Because its completely unthinkable for Senku to manage to create a phone in the stone world. Even if they are spies, what can they do?"
798,Phones kind of yeah. Radio really not. And it's not like there aren't other more primitive ways to communicate long distance.
799,i think you should add double quotes for emphasis
800,"Tsukasa is royally pissed now   Don't mess with Bruno  . But hey, communications is a solid idea that they can use to their advantage. We're only 5 episodes away from the end of the season though, so I do wonder how much time this will take for them especially since they're cutting it close with Tsukasa ready to  rip some throats out. "
801,"tsukasa, strongest guy ever: i'm going to revive this guy who is also super strong that I've been looking for    muscle squad: lol he looks weak, we can take him    some real geniuses right here"
802,Best part of Dr. Stone is coming boyz
803, USHIOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!    
804,"I like it how we joked about Senku making cellphones we when reach like episode 80, but this madman looks like he is going to do it in the next episode."
805,I think smartphones is a strange way to win but I’m interested in the guerrilla tactics they will hopefully use
806," CELL PHONES???    honestly that's a surprise but when Senku is doing it... And so I think about it and yes it makes a lot of sense to make cell phones.    To begin let me tell you what are they making, I don't think they will make a smart phone, they will do just a communication thingy, you know these old phones that I don't know their names lmao.    Of course computer chips and electric circuits are needed so they will need a lot of stuff that we can see at   21:48   even though it does not say the full thing entirely.    If you look at that  diagram?  you can see they will start of by making Plastic which is a big step to civilization, plastic makes life easier and it's a must  but it's also contaminate so don't throw it anywhere it pollutes.  Anyway   Polymers   are essential, any composed stuff is called a polymer. Plastic, PVC, HTPB  Liquid rubber... etc  are all polymers making them is fairly easy.    The one that I think Senku will make is   Polyethylene    C2H4 n - which is regular plastic. it's composed of really simple stuff just hydrogen and Carbon and making it is easy. They will first need to make their monomer, which is Ethylene which can be made by dehydrating Ethanol  Alcohol . see fairly easy.    Then they will polymerize it to make a huge quantity. Now they can either use a catalyst to mass produce it or they will just take Radical polymerization route which takes a long time! Either way they reached their goal of making plastic. But at the diagram they are using Beehive which made of Beewax  C15H31COOC30H61  and that does not provide any use for making plastic, it's just used as a paint maybe they will pain the plastic!    `-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------`    The next thing is Circuit boards. In the pic   21:28   They said they need Tin, Lead and Sulfuric Acid. Lmao that's soo over simplified! The main thing in circuits boards isn't plastic by the way, it's Silicon, Silicon can be achieved so easily. Sand  Silicon Oxide  they can easily extract silicon from sand when Senku want it. They just mix Sand with carbon  coal  and heat it up in the furnace that they have to get Silicon. But it's not in it's purest form, they can make it more pure but they will need Manganese and Chlorine which is hard to obtain!    Of course the tin and lead they need it for soldering. and you can see there that they will need batteries.    Now for communication the device that they need must produce Radio signals to let Senku communicate with them! They will also need a tower to make a transmitter a dish.... Now I highly doubt that Senku will use Satellites they still there of course in space but can he really reach and access a geostationary satellite  BTW a lot of satellites who are in high earth orbit or a geostationary orbit are still there, the atmospheric drag won't affect them as much!  It'll be hard boys, but he I think he will use a simple magnet and copper wires to make a transmitter and a receiver!... And oh yes that's right they will need gold!! it's a must but they will need just a small amount of it! this sums every thing that they will need, the Rochelle salt will be very useful for produce the radio waves that's why you see there is headphones in suika!"
807,Excellent analysis!
809,"I am afraid that they will! Unless they are aware about reusable paper bags and so they will manufacture it more.    But still, water bottles, laptops, cars, every electronic device, and a lot alot of things They will probably make it again."
810,"Yes, some satellites could still be in one piece. But, i don't think that the batteries can last 3700 years and even if they did you would still have to find then. Even if Senku did some r theydidthemonstermath and predicted where the satellites are you wold have to figure out the specific commands to work with then."
811,"Yeah, The lithium Ion Batteries won't probably last that long. Even though they use solar energy as an energy source. They will degrade over time unless the satellite use the energy from a decaying plutonium which last for 24000 years! there 30 satellites that have nuclear power source But they are all in a low earth orbit, they probably might have fall down!    Now I think yeah, Satellites does have a specific command to work with them, I think. It's up for who had made it though so we can't just throw a random command and hope it works."
812,"as an EE, I'm excited for this arc. A simple two-way radio is doable with their tech but it would have to be backpack size rather than cellphone sized. They are using vacuum tubes after all. Not something you can really miniaturize easily. Not to mention the chemical battery and other parts."
813,"Yeah, it will be heavy... but thinking about they can easily camouflage it, making it think that it's a normal bag, with a receiver!"
814,Still somewhat classifies as cell phone though if they can carry it around with them. It's just a large-ass cell phone lol.
815,Yeah... what Senku's up to is probably going to look like those field phones they hauled around during WWII.
816,"They dont need to make a 2 way radio that is tuned. They dont have an FCC to worry about, and can use a spammer instead that broadcasts to all frequencies in a wide range. It's way easier to make in a world with no possibility of interception. Basic spammers can be made with a voltaic pile and a coil of wire."
817,"Upvote for science!    About circuit boards, maybe the beeswax could be used as a PCB etching mask?  I'm not sure how they plan to get the copper to stick to the base.  Could they use plastic as a base and then do trace etching with sulfuric acid?   Then just need lead tin to soldier components on."
818,"Beeswax can probably be used as an etching mask if you don't care much about getting those 0.2mm resolution traces. But you'd have to use something else as an etchant. Sulfuric acid on it's own doesn't do anything to copper. Luckily there are  plenty of options.     But honestly, making PCB's is really unnecessary here. All you really need is a few vacuum tubes, some coils and a few caps to make a simple oscillator circuit that gets AM modulated. Same for the receiver. Better to just go  old school , hammer a few pegs into some wood and wrap components between them to build your circuit.    It's just going to be a real bitch to get the frequencies to match up properly using home made caps and coils. Those are going to have a shitload of drift over time."
819,"Upvote for Reply    Maybe!    I just wonder how they will do it, can't wait for the next episode. Although I hope they won't prolong it as they did with Sulfa-drug."
820,Th fact that I’m reading comments like these in an anime discussion thread is why I love Dr. Stone
821,Eyes wider than the grand canyon...
822,So Tsukasa wanted to make a new world vastly different from the old world    and he chooses to resurrect a bunch of hyper-masculine dudes and make himself very much like a king?
823,Workforce and influence. You can't start with kids.
824,"     this, it sounds a lot like that his problem wasn't with few people owning and controlling everthing, his problem was with the fact that it wasnt him."
825,"That's exactly it. He's a fool, just not a fool who thinks any sort of order can arise from goodwill alone. The Tsukasa Empire can't rely on weapons of science in order to create a monopoly on violence, so it uses witless thugs who follow their leader as loyally as a dog.     The one with the biggest stick makes the rules, that's the foundation on which all enduring nations are built. I do think Tsukasa  is  earnestly convinced that his particular set of rules are the most righteous; the fatal sin committed by the Tsukasa Empire is thus not its hypocrisy, but the fact that it cannot be sustained in its ideal form once Tsukasa's charisma erodes. Even as it grows and its power becomes less and less centralized, especially with the lack of telecommunications tech, there will be those who hoard power and their philosophies will diverge from Tsukasa's own. Even if they're technically flying Tsukasa's colors in their flags, nothing will stop those who would ultimately abuse their power to their personal benefit. Any institution he builds to enforce his ideals across the land would be just as susceptible to corruption as any that have ever existed in the ancient world. Nevertheless, Tsukasa will continue to rule his fairytale world for as long as he can, pretending he can truly stamp out all the bad seeds by rejecting technology. Meanwhile at least a dozen other guys plot to kill him and take his place. Once he's gone, Tsukasa will leave no legacy but a world that looks exactly like the old one except for the fact that everyone shits in the woods and wipes their ass with leaves.     At least, that's my interpretation of Tsukasa's character. He isn't perverse. He's incompetent."
826,"Also people like Chrome will always exist, science will find a way."
827,"Very succinct. I think Tsukasa's inability to recognise that all he's created is a tyranny that he will inevitably be replaced in is perhaps the most amusing thing. Plus, when the guy who can punch out lions is dead, it'd create a massive power vacuum of people wanting to take the top dog spot.     Oops, I guess property exists again."
828,"The funniest thing of all is that, for how smart the story seems to depict him, his plan has so many flaws that it's even ridiculous. Does he even believies that his ""empire"" will be able to work the same way when it starts to expand? Because it might work just fine at this moment, when it's still small enough that he can directly control everything, but once he needs to starts delegating it will be a different matter.    Also, I find very funny their obsession with the adults when I think of what they plan to do once they become adults themselves."
829,"That's the problem with fanatics. They are, in general, smart people but their zealotry blindes them to the most obvious of things.    I also think that's why Senku didn't even try to convince him, becuase he knew it was useless."
830,He's really starting to remind me of Mao Zedong.  And his empire where nobody owns anything will probably go the same way.
831,I just wish Senku wasn't such a goody two-shoes. He could easily resolve the Tsukasa situation if he invested some time in chemical weapons or just good old poison.
832,"and im the opposite  im tired of ""science and logic = cruelty"" trope  there's too much of it and seeing senku choosing the most logical AND morally sound option at the same time is so refreshing!  i also can't belive all tsukasas followers are cruel and evil, its just not possible. most of them are regular people from our age, so. chemical weapons would be just cruelty against innocent. amd aren't they banned in modern warfare? because they're too cruel?  even tsukasa wouldn't do that xd"
833,"     This is   Stone warudo  . There are no laws to uphold.     Besides, I'm not advocating using sulphuric acid gas on all of Tsukasa's people.    Just the ones dumb enough to be part of his militia...who, aside from Hyoga, have so far all been demonstrably brain-dead thugs  and dead-dead, as is the case of the ones that went with Hyoga. "
834,"Not even delegating or controlling is an issue - if he revives many more people than what he has, ""nature"" won't be so ""bountiful"" anymore. He'll end up over-fishing, over-hunting, and be forced to move around as nomads, which would be hell on the morale of his people.     Frankly I'm still amazed that so many people he revived aren't so attached to modern technology and amenities in the first place.    And what will he do when his clan is afflicted with their first illness? It could easily become a plague."
835,"     That's another point a find particularly important here. We've seen that he has already ""revived"" a considerable amount of people, and am I seriously suposed to believe that ANY of them had any kind of issue with that, specially knowing that Senku is around? And even more, what about the food? It's hard to believe that a bunch of teenagers used to the commodities of our society would have no complaints about having to rennounce to a modern diet. I mean, we already have the example of Gen and his coke. He can't be the only one thinking like that.    PS: obviously, I'm aware that this is a shonen, so I don't expect  neither it needs to  this story to be absolutely realistic. These are just thoughts I had while and after watching the chapter. Besides, I think the manga really does a good job on the side of Senku and how he and the villagers deal with the issues of having to replicate modern science in a stone age environment."
836,"Yeah, it's honestly just weird.     In some ways Dr Stone would be better if it weren't a Shonen. Oh well, at least what we've got is pretty good for the most part, plot holes aside."
837,There's a reason his minions are all brainless except spear guy
838,"Nah, he hates debt and taxes and things like that. In his world there are no classes. It's just his influence and popularity he had in the old world that get people to work together. Tsukasa did nothing wrong."
839,"I'd argue that the society Tsukasa is creating is more like an absolute monarchy than a classless society  absolute monarchy with Anarcho-primitivist characteristics is a galaxy-brained ideology if I ever heard one . The decision-making process seems to be entirely centred on Tuskasa, rather than being direct or consensus democracy as one would expect in a classless commune."
840,"Tsukasa's empire is a bit different from absolute monarchy.     He basically wants to make an ideal classless society with ""uncorrupted"" people who don't compete with each other for wealth and simply have everything they need, but instead he created a society where everyone obeys him out of respect fear.      And while he holds power over everything, an absolute monarchy would require Tsukasa to raise himself and his offsprings to a position of absolute rulers of the entire empire and therefore creating another social class, which definitely isn't what he's going for. It would be far better to describe Tsukasa's empire as a power dictatorship, or to simplify it even more - a standard prehistorical tribal society with one leader who is determined by power."
841,"I would argue that it's a little vague. I don't think Tsukasa would have an issue with his people governing themselves,  provided  they don't break his principles. Which is a tall order."
842,"Tsukasa would look at the way Ishigami Village was run before Senku showed up, and pretty much like the way they do things. He's making a tribal chiefdom and not paying much attention to modern political ideology."
843,"It’s more like, he thinks physical strength, not affluence, should be what determines political power. He’s kind of an extreme fascist anarcho-primitivist. His ideal society is probably Sparta or something."
844,"He created classes based on might. He's ruling because everyone is afraid of a guy who can punch lions and win, or respects him for it. I'm 100% sure most are biding their time, finding a moment of weakness to replace him as the top dog.     He's incredibly noble, but equally naive when it comes to human relations. Not all adults are corrupt, and not all children are pure, we are all humans, and very prone to greed and power trips."
845,     ?? Currently he's clearly an upper class.
846,"He's a leader, doesn't mean he has any more rights. Anyone can go and form their own tribe, they just rather follow him. So he needs to act the part."
847,Anyone that doesn't know science maybe. He catches you making one baking soda volcano though and you're a dead man
848,"You're allowed to do flame color reactions, no nukes tho. There need to be limitations."
849,Tsukasa's Empire sounds a bit like Demacia from League of Legends in that case.
850,"Classes aren't only defined by ""rights"", they come basically from power discrepancies.    The ""rights"" one, happens when a state gives more rights to a certain section of the population. Here, the state enforces it's monopoly of violence to give this class more power over others  segregation, what nazis did to jews, even back in feudalism with the nobles and clergy had more rights than the rest     There's also things like the power of money. Rich people have more ways to influence society due to the power money brings them. This is more clear on societies closer to oligarchies  hell, even in the US if you have enough money you can sue people into submission, or simply influence politics with your money, either by bribing, or sponsoring politicians . This is what Tsukasa clearly wants to get rid of.    But on his empire Tsukasa, even if he didn't mean to, has made himself, and those closest to him a different class from the weaker, and normal people. Again, even if he didn't mean to, just the fact that he can probably kill everyone means everyone else has to go along with him  this time the power discrepancy is literally fighting power ."
851,     He's clearly a barbarian.
852,"Which is even stranger considering he was a famous fighter, and was probably pretty wealthy."
854,no
855,"I find something essentially wrong with his ideology. He wants to limit the human technology but that is only a short term measure. Even if he is able to keep the current generation in stone age, history will repeat itself and humanity will rebuild itself back to modern age.     Even religion will come back because I doubt people actually had something like religion in stone age."
856,"His ideology is fundamentally flawed. It's not science that creates a ruling class that he apparently hates. Go back thousands of years to Mesopotamia and even without much technology we still end up with a disparity between the ruling class, civilians, women and slaves.     Even if Tsukasa wins, his ideology won't last more than a couple of generations and then the cycle will continue. Except since Tsukasa won, humanity would have literally reset to the stone age and while we wouldn't have modern technology anymore, the disparity between individuals from ancient civilizations will rear its ugly head anyways and we'll have another 10,000 years of being ruled by kings.    In fact I'd say science  and more specifically the industrial revolution   closed  the gap between regular civilians and the ruling class."
857,There's a reason why anarcho-primitivists are a running joke in leftwing circles.
858,     just seeing that makes me chuckle.
859,"Abolish all hierarchies  !!           Except disability and physical or mental sickness, we should make sure to entrench that by eliminating modern medicine. Definitely shouldn't keep anything that might alleviate body dysphoria. Oh, hierarchies arising from proximity to different resources or social groups that could be alleviated by a modern transportation + communication system? Doesn't count. Whoah, the physically strong are creating a de facto ruling class by excluding the weak from access to resources? Better than developing tech that makes people more equal!"
860,"Yeah, what he's doing is creating a civilization based solely on might. He's at the top and everyone is his subordinate because they fear and or respect him. And after he's gone? Things will go back again to having a ruling class."
861,"     While you're not wrong that capitalism  which rose to prominence during the industrial revolution  is a step up from feudalism, it's not exactly a level playing field. Technological progress can enable the levelling of hierarchy, but it is not a natural consequence—we've certainly advanced technologically since the 1950s, but income inequality has grown."
862,The trouble is it's the best we've got. Every other system leads to worse.
863,"We can always improve things, though. You don't have to completely throw away capitalism to do that."
864,"Naturally, which is why the alternatives proposed in the last century or so keep failing to produce results - and why things had to change  regulation, for example, to eliminate monopolies - though now we need to adapt again to deal with corporate oligarchies "
865,Not really the place for this discussion.
871,"Actually I think his ideology worked exactly like primitive tribes. Primitive hunter-gatherers didn't exactly have enough people to have slaves and a ruling working class. In fact in history the standard of living of the average person took a giant dip when farming was discovered and politics were born out of the population increase. It wasn't until the steam & scientific revolution happened that everyone's standard of living started rising exponentially.    The catch is that you will never grow your numbers if you don't discover farming and agriculture, and the tribe will forever be population limited by factor of food supply in the wild so they will never go above 150 people or so Dunbar's number  unless they split off and become nomadic. If this was more realistic, him or his descendants would certainly never rule over nature for a long long time."
872,"You're right. Tbh isn't Ishigami Village  before Senku  basically Tsukasa's ideal? Science Sorcery frowned upon, strongest warrior is chief, etc    But I'd hardly call a village of a hundred ""creating a new world""."
873,"TBF technology  does  create that. In Mesopotamia the technology that did it was agriculture, which is the first major advancement in that sense. That’s technology. It creates a food surplus which means some people can specialise in tasks other than food production."
874,Engels'  The Origin  is a good read on this.
875,"He also seem to be worry about the weapons of science, but if he had not started with his bullshit ideology, Senku could have not need to be creating them in the first place."
876,Progress. You can't kill progress because progress is in out nature. It takes time and maybe we have some dark ages but you can't kill progress. Ever!
877,"That's actually a debatable point.     Civilization is NOT simply an inevitable result. There are  still  tribes out there living much as humans did tens of thousands of years ago. They aren't ""primitive"" really indeed they probably could tell you all there is to know about their forests islands etc far better then an interloper naturalist with a PhD. Yet they'll use stone tools and have for 10,000 years just because there is no convenient supply of metal nearby. They won't grow grain because again no grain. They won't have animal labor because... well you get the idea.    Now consider that humanity has already previously used up many of the easy to reach resources. A primitive society isn't going to eke iron ore or coal out of a depleted mine. It is quite possible that we are as a species are past a point of no return and our civilization must either endure or never rise again."
878,Even Gen acknowledged that he was lining some half baked reasoning and using charisma to boost it.
879,"Eventually, but look at the village. Yeah Chrome was on the path to start slowly, slowly crawling towards science again, but it was only after thousands of years since the astronauts that he showed up, and it would be thousands more before their descendants ever reached modern technology.    If Tsukasa could just suppress science long enough for the modern world to be forgotten by the next generation, it would be thousands of years before it came back. Humanity might not stay the way he wants it forever, but if he could keep human society working the way he wants it to for thousands of years that would be more than any ideology in history has ever managed."
880,Tsukasa is kind of full of shit if you hadn't noticed.
881,"His philosophy only extends with him, and doesn't pass along after he dies. It's a short-sighted philosophy of strength that requires considerable bloodshed and power to accomplish, especially if the goal is to prevent people from acquiring knowledge beyond the stone age.    Tsukasa is selfish."
882,"See a lot of where I disagree with many of the analyses being made in other replies is that they expect Tsukasa to be establishing a self-perpetuating system, where my view on it is that the Tsukasa now wants that paleo lifestyle for himself, and will bring people who are like-minded into his group  either by convincing them with his logic or charisma , after which he will lead out the rest of his life, and the people who come after him can do whatever they want since he won't be there anymore.     ;    Which to be honest sounds a heck of a lot more dangerous to me."
883,thats literally the legion in fallout new vegas
884,He's a delusional teenager who thinks he knows how  a perfect world would look.    Much like the people who think that communism would work.
885,hey! communism was a great idea in theory just not in practice just like how capitalism is a great idea in theory just not in practice just like socialism is a great idea in theory just in practice...
886,"If you take out human behavior and look at it in a sterile environment communism would work and would be a awsome system, unfortunately human nature is selfish and greedy"
887,"The hot takes on communism from  r anime     You just love to see it, folks!"
888,"To be fair, communism does work...inside a commune, which is sort of what they’ve got going. It just doesn’t work above a certain scale, when people begin to be separated from the fruits of their labor. In small groups, everyone sees and gets a part of everyone else’s labor, which makes for an effective, tight-knit group that’s willing to work for the benefit of said group because it’s people and faces they know and care about."
889,"The main reason it doesn't work is also because of the human aspect.    People want things, and if they can get more than their colleagues, they will."
890,"I think that depends on the individual person. Neither of us can use the “it’s human nature” defense, because people can swing so wildly in either direction.    Most people especially in a stone world where teamwork gets you more food and there are no real permanent possessions since money and tech don’t exist  could very easily exist within a commune of sorts given a capable, charismatic leader like Tsukasa. It doesn’t happen nowadays because money and tech are permanent benefits that confer status and don’t require upkeep, but in a world where everything is temporary and requires constant upkeep, communism is probably a wise survival choice."
891,"Right but it only takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch, as they say.."
892,"The thing is, in a small community you have a better clue what everyone´s up to and exiling bad apples was a thing."
893,"Oh yea sure, I'd say the limit of a communistic commune is around 50-100 people.."
894,"Well yeah. But I feel like stone-age communism would be a lot more self-enforcing, and the greedy ones wouldn’t really have a mechanism to exercise their greed when they can’t manipulate others into working for them. In a commune survival environment, I feel like someone constantly trying to laze around and not do work of any kind while reaping the rewards of others work would be slapped down or exiled pretty quickly.    I imagine the only thing keeping it together here is Tsukasas charisma and the underlying threat of brutal physical pain if they try and “revert to the old world way of thinking”."
895,"I was one billion percent sure he'd say that the greatest weapon would be gas, or any other chemical warfare weapons    But yea, communications are pretty important too, though they'll probably still need weapons, even if he says there'll be no bloodshed        schemingsaten "
896,"I was expecting a basic tank. Wouldn't even need to have a working gun, it'd destroy their enemies' morale by it's mere existence."
897,just make an armoured vehicle and a slingshot for the gun i dont think tsukasa has anything that can punch through steel
898,Probably his bare fists
899,I’m pretty sure Davinci had designed a tank with spinning blade before. It would be really useful here.
900,"Thought the answer was going to be ""mass production"". Get a ton of supply lines down, go through a fuck ton of resources and maybe get some automation going on turning your Civ game into Factorio; what are the natives with their pointy sticks gonna do?"
901,"Hmm, I think the problem would be that they're outnumbered. There aren't too many capable fighters in the village, that's why they need a weapon against masses"
902,"Yeah, but with mass production you don't need a weapon; you can have 50+ pretty easily. Stone age frag grenades anyone?"
903,"Gotta mass produce the soldiers themselves, flesh and bones, like in Age of Empires"
904,They don't have enough time to create a factory line nor enough labor for mass production. So that is not going to happen for now.
905,Not like cellphones are a more logical alternative.
906,Well Senku did say he wanted a bloodless solution.
907,I mean that's the whole conflict - Tsukasa is willing to kill people and only saves the ones who share his ideal while Senku wants to save everyone.      Bit of a hypocrite if Senku just ends up killing everyone who disagrees with him
908,Well he is probably going to build a simple AM-Radio which does not require a factory
909,"They have like 5 people they need to produce stuff for, making a mass production line is going to take them longer than just making the things directly. Mass production only becomes valuable once you have masses to produce for."
910,"Once it became clear that Senku was not going to go the war crimes route, my guess was going to be memes or more seriously, some sort of propaganda or other form of psychological warfare , though I guess a lot of the effectiveness of that as a weapon is predicated on mass communication."
911,"MEMES, THE DNA OF THE SOUL."
912,"He's just going to drop off a crate of cola and a note saying ""want more? join me""."
913,"My thought was airforce superiority. There's really not much Tsukasa could do if, for example, they were bombarded by a fleet of hot air balloons, shooting down at them with arrows."
914,same    poison gas would be a cheap yet deadly weapon
915,Yeah was half expecting him to gather the gas from the lake and just go full on Holocaust on the base
916,"Yea, I definitely thought they were going for some AoE considering they numbers Tsukasa probably has"
917,"It would be pretty sad killing them all, but it might be the best solution if they're in a pinch. They're definitely not in a good state right now.    Chemical weapons can turn the tide super easily"
918,While brainstorming I had the same conclusion and reaction as Gen's. LMAO. My final conclusion was a railgun though.
919,I cant wait until next season when he builds a full sized gundam to crush all who oppose science
920,"Get in the robot, Senku!"
921,"YO! Senku, get in the robot!"
922,"Your dad loves you, get in the robot!"
923,Dr. Süsser Tod
924,"You don't need to tell him that, he will be there from the moment he finishes that robot."
925,The Mecha Senku that appears on some explanations will come to life!
926,Where would he get the amount of electricity needed for a freaking railgun?
927,"Ramen-powered villagers, maybe, lol"
928,"Hey, never underestimate the power of a lot of villagers. That's how D&D ended up with the  peasant railgun. "
929,"          I don't know what I was expecting, but a game-breaking linear version of hot potato as an improvised railgun certainly wasn't it."
930,"And if the gm don't like you pulling this shit, they will make each peasant roll for agility  with increasing requirement as the projectile goes faster  and see how many of your peasants die attempting this."
931,"Several of you will die, but that's a sacrifice im willing to make!!"
932,That's half the fun though. Seeing what BS you can get away with the GM and what they throw back.
933,"This reminded me of the "" Disgusting Characters "" series. Welp, time to read it again."
934, The peasant railgun 
935,A tsundere esper
936,"It wouldn't be military grade, but he might be able to make something that can replace a gun.  People have already built working handheld ones  that surpass normal bullet speeds."
937,"Develop lvl 5 esper powers, how else?"
938,"Same here, in principle railguns are very easy to make if you ignore the energy part. The other one I thought would be catapults for sieging, but that's not modern at all."
939,"Even the energy part isn't too big of a problem to overcome. They don't need a military grade railgun that fires bullets at a million kilometers per second after all, they only need one roughly on par with a gun.  People have already made handheld ones which can do that.  Railguns don't really have a minimum energy requirement, they just scale with however much you put in."
940,lol. the real answer is the airplane
941,"Germany couldn't build and test tanks before World War 2 because of the limitations of the Versailles treaty. They were able to train and produce some tanks before WW2 but it was no match compared to other countries.    Hans von Seeckt, a German Army Commander, trained the army to use maneuver warfare. With the light tanks that Germany had General Heinz Guderian insisted that every tank be equipped with radio communications. Other nations had radio communications but there were not widely used. Coupling these two tactics is what gave Germany a leg up in the war despite their weaker tanks.    Excited to see how this plays out in Dr. Stone."
944,"Damn, those Fist of the North Star bandits are really out of place.     I was secretly hoping that Tsukasa would only revive beautiful young people and start a Pillarmen society."
945,"Some of the most compelling villains are the ones who have a point and a set goal they want to accomplish without being afraid of getting their hands dirty. Tsukasa is one of these villains and while murder is a horrible way towards his goal, he's still the hero in his mind and that's part of what makes him dangerous. The other parts being his ridiculous strength and charisma."
946,"well, getting your hands as dirty as shounen goes, though"
947,"please tsukasa is just Pol Pot reborn in a jojo character! nobody with half a functioning brain would think that the stone age was the best age! one cold and they are all dead! shit most of them would die before 40... compelling would be if he at least recognize that science and technologies would male a better world but still want'S to kill every rich person  not the old...  like reviving someone asking them what the have done in the past and then kill them if they were ""evil"" in his eyes... with that it would be at least possible that he would gather a somewhat large following... but with "" we now live in the stone age, only the young and strong may live"" bullshit i doubt that even 1% of the revived people would follow him... simply because most people have parents and grand-parents they at least dont want to murder..."
948,Tsukasa: I want to build a peaceful world with only kind hearted people.       Also Tsukasa: revives mean looking tough dudes and kills everyone who disagrees with him.
949,I saw that road map. That’s some factorio shit right there
950,i want to play factorio now
951,The ultimate weapon is a Nokia phone
952,"sorry to be the asshole pointing out all the flaws, but this series premise is really stupid  not the stone thing but the ""strongest teenager"" thing ....    here are my main problems with this series:    1. the ""philosophy""  or better politics  of Tsukasa is practically the ideas of the  Khmer Rouge , while it did exist in the past, it was a total nightmare for everyone and was defeated by other communists, because it was so evil, there is literally no chance that a lot of people would follow this ideas... very few people would accept the idea: ""we will will live in the stone-age forever because progress is evil"" mentality... it's just absurd...   2. quite frankly the lack of killing intent of the ""hero"" is so stupid... he's smart... he can use literally a million ways to kill Tsukasa if he wants  and save hundreds of thousands of people , he could use poison, or even a simple illness would wipe out the pseudo-khmers... but senku spent weeks or months to first produce medication  which is ok  and then to make katana's  a melee weapon that wont give them any advantages against a large group of enemies ... produce fucking composite bows, rapid fire cross-bows or a scorpion... but not fucking swords that are slightly better then other weapons...   3. why doesn't he go back to the hot-springs, where he got the gunpowder? produce bombs!  4. he also should have poisoned tuskasa in the 3rd episode, when he learned of his murderous intends. play along, give him food or a drink with a strong poison and that's that... 1000 lives saved! someone who knows how to produce Sulfanilamide, can create a deadly poison in a few days...  5. where are all the sane people tsukasa has revived? is japan simply full of genocidal maniacs that all BUT ONE of these revived peopled are OK with living in the stone age and murdering everybody over 20? i get it tsukasa is a evil sociopath, who must be the reborn Pol Pot, but where does all the rest of these mass murders come from? maybe 1 to 10% of a population would be ok with that, and tsukasa has no idea what the people are thinking when he revives them... also a society build on the ""strength"" would be filled to the brink with rapists... no women there would be save  by design ...     sorry the series is quite good but the fact that practically nobody there behaves like a human really destroys the ""suspense of disbelieve""... i can believe that a green light turned everybody to stone, i can believe that there is a super genius how has memorized Wikipedia for fun before his 18th birthday... i can even believe that there is a superhuman who can beat a fucking lion bare-hands and wants to rule the world... what I cannot believe is, that there isn't a living hell where he's ruling because he has to suppress everybody by brute force , that nobody is deserting this maniac and that a freaking genius hasn't already killed the Conan-wannabe..."
953,"     Yeah; the choice of weapons tech is pretty sad.     there are countless ways to synthesize bombs, noxious gasses, poisons. And it would be trivial to make crossbows, wagons, and artillery pieces.     Katana has to be one of the worst choices because it isnt going to make a feeble villager able to fight par with one of tsukasa's brutes. But a crossbow with a poisoned bolt, and a catapult lobbing flammable and toxic tear gas would give them an overwhelming advantage.    When 5 people can take on your entire village, communications tech isnt going to make any difference.    Even more realistically though, he shouldnt be needing to fight at all:         Tsukas's tribe would be full time hunter gatherers clinging to a subsistence level existence.     Rather than muscle-bound brutes, they would be skinny, starving, infighting, and spreading out into the wilds in search of food. They would have no time or interest in returning home to tsukasa to feed him and listen to his orders. Being a hunter gatherer in the wild is a full time job; and thats when you are super familiar with the terrain, plants, and animals.     Tsukasa's people dont have the level of agricultural knowledge needed to make a society at even a patheric khmer rouge level. Only their best hunters would survive, and the bulk brutish or super warrior types wouldnt be the likely ones. The thin, low metabolism clever ones who can survive on a low calorie diet would be more likely to survive.    And even then, within a few months they would be crawling at Senku's feet begging for scraps."
955,"        But that's an issue. The fact is, he's at war with someone who has already killed him once and is more than willing to kill him.    Tsukasa will never see eye to eye with Senku and will never stop threatening Senku's goal.    Senku has to decide: Kill Tsukasa to save the many, or spare Tsukasa and leave him to shatter  kill  even more adults than he already has."
956,"While it's true that Tsukasa must be stopped, I disagree that Senku should go as low as killing his minions.    Not all of them are evil, some are just brutes who don't know better or think there's nowhere else to turn to."
957,Sacrifice the few for the many that is the only true path.
959,"     oh then when he fired the crossbow he didn't wanted to kill tsukasa? that's even stupider... a smart and more importantly a moral person has to kill if the alternative is letting hundreds, thousands or millions of other people die... how many people did tsukasa already killed? a few hundred? a few thousand?      here is a guide to create gunpowder  senku has everything he needs..."
960,"Yea, except time... Your link literally says it takes several months."
961,5 - so i guess.you won't be disappointed when you learn more... what we saw isnt everything
962,"The liberation movement in Cambodia involved millions of people and is much more nuanced than whatever you read from wikipedia.         It is absurd which is why it is not Khmer Rouge or anyone's belief. There's a certain moment when you grow up and realize that if your summary of what someone else believes sounds like a joke, it's your problem. Like, if you wake up and go ""wow I just solved every problem known to man, why did no one think of this?"" It's because you're delusional and intellectually lazy. You don't give an ounce of credit to the Khmer Rouge which you did not bother to learn anything about. I recommend Michael Vickery's book on Cambodia                      "
963,"Hmm, ok let's see:    1. And?  Tsukasa's ideology is supposed to be dumb. We aren't meant to root for him but see him as aderanged fool and a danger to humanity, so what's your point?    2. Senku literally built his ideology on ""I will save every last human"". We may think he is dumb for adhering to a ""no killing"" rule but it is consistent with his previous characterizatiopn. He is an idealist first and foremost, not a ""hard man making hard decisions"" or other such similar ""smart"" character archetype.    3. Because he is lacking sulfuric acid? He literally explained it during last episode. Speedwatching too much?    4.  See 2. Also, tsukasa isn't stupid either, he probably expected something like that.    5.  This is the typical retarded ""Stuff hasn't been explained during the first 5 minutes ergo PLOTHOLE!"". Maybe, I don't know, the story takes time to explain everything? It is that crazy that some stuff may be revealed over time instead of info-dumped fro mthe start? Also, Tsukasa hand picked everyone he revived, so he probably choose people who would agree with him  and even then most of his people probably don'ta gree with killing but they either follow Tsukasa out of respect fear or because they don't actually know that e is a murderer .     ;    Tl;dr: don't r imverysmart and actualyl pay attention."
964,"     Kind of a poor plan, though. He's already failed that goal because he allowed Tsukasa to live, and he went on to kill large numbers of adults. Probably hundreds by now."
965,"And a lot of humans are already too broken up lost somewhere too hard to reach by now. The idea still is to save every human he can.    Now, I agree he should just kill them but that doesn't quite fit with his characterization. As explained by Tsukasa during their showdown, Senku is soft on the inside even if he acts like he isn't and that makes his weak  comparatively ."
966,"      actually  just a minor nitpick, but when you tell someone to pay attention, you should pay attention to the things you write...     1. yes it'S stupid, that's why it'S stupid that he has so many followers... and literally nobody  as far as we have seen, except for ONE person  has deserted him... that's the problem...  2. if you let other people die which you could have saved you are also a criminal... if i see a men killing a child and just stand back and proclaim that the right of the men to murder the child is as valid as the child's right to live, I'm not moral, I'm a monster   3. yeah you are right... there is only on bat-cave in all of japan... my bad... there is literally no way he could have found another source of sulfuric acid, it not like there was a hot spring where you could find sulfur to create sulfuric acid... it's way easier to produce katana's...   4. see 2  5.  "" Also, Tsukasa hand picked everyone he revived, so he probably choose people who would agree with him ""   so did he know everybody he's been reviving? or is he a mind-reader who can read the minds of people?     but i get it you don't like to think, so yo have to insult people who have a problem with bad character-motivation and who think about the plot... you don't have to agree with me but don't act so smug while ignoring practically everything I said     a normal person who gets revived would want to revive his loved-ones  family  and would instantaneously find out why he isn't aloud and would either try to stop tsukasa or at least make a run for it, to get away from this genocidal maniac... if you would stay there, you are also a monster"
967,".3. He needs  nitric  acid to make saltpeter, not sulfuric. It can be made from humanure, but takes months. Why didn't Senku begin that process when he started medicine preparation? He isn't perfect, I guess. Looking for another bat cave in close proximity would be waste of human resources and time atm."
968,"1. HOW DO YOU  KNOW  THIS? we literally have seen like 5 seconds of Tsukasa's ""empire"" and someone already defected!  Gen  Are you fucking kidding me?    2. I don't get what you are trying to say here. Senku has a no killing rule, it's not about the ""right"" of anyone. You may or may not agree with it  personally I don't  but it is consistent with the character.    3. No, but does Senku know where they are? Does Senku have a magical sulfuric acid detector? Because he does have iron and irong working but he certainly doesn't have sulfuric acid.    4. Still doens't make sense.    5. Yes, he actually does either know them or they are known by someone else he revived. Notice how Hyoga knew him already? It is the same for almost everyone.         You are the one who doesn't want to thik. You came here with half baked ""ideas"" and ""insight"" and you are clearly full of bullshit. Honestly, if you considered it bad character motivation maybe you should have, I don't know, dropped this 15 episodes ago.    And no, I didn't ignore shit, I pointed out how you were completely wrong about it.           HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO? Have you seen more than has already been shown? Do you have some kind of precognitive power?      EDIT:       Also, if you need this level of pedantry to help your pissy ""arguments"" then maybe you should just shut up."
969,You're looking way too much into it just enjoy the Anime. It's not a factual documentary you are watching lmao.
970,the problem is we feel the disappointment even without looking into it.    we just do so we can pinpoint the shortcomings and give constructive criticism.
971,"Senku doesn't want to kill anyone because that would     1. make him a murderer    and    2. make it harder to convert more people to the kingdom of science, because senku would be a murderer    The entire point of the series is that everybody's feats are super exaggerated because it's a story. They still treat the science realistically so that's all that matters: it's fun to see literal superhumans get stumped by real life science."
972," Tsukasa's yaoi hands     Wow I'm actually impressed what the Tsukasa Empire has accomplished in only half a year. They've got interesting architecture carved right into the mountains.    Homura is dangerous. She's as athletic as Kohaku and very acrobatic. Maybe she was a performer before the Stone World. I'm gonna enjoy watching Aki Toyosaki play her.    They actually managed to repel Hyouka and the Fist of the North Star rejects.     THEY'RE GONNA MAKE CELL PHONES    We were set up! When Taiju said smartphones, we we're led to believe that it's too advanced, but not anymore! We've got a new roadmap to follow. I am wondering if they'll show the phones in action by the end of the season or if they'll finish making them and wait till Season 2 to show them off.     Gen reaction face       IT'S BEEN SO LONG     Honestly I really like Taiju's cloak     Oh boy, Tsukasa is not happy to hear that Senku is alive "
973,  VoteTsukasa Communism!
974,"Why is Senku making cellphones instead of chem weapons and napalm? He's not very smart for a science guy unless Tsukasa is giving him a lot of time on purpose...    Proper cell communication will require a whole infrastructure to be viable, which they won't have time for."
975,"He is not a killer. He intends to win this with minimal deaths, if any."
976,"Which is impractical and will result in far more deaths  if we count smashed statue-people .    To save as many people as possible, you must become death and kill a smaller number in this scenario. Kind of like why Japan was nuked."
977,"     Yeah, that'll be a compelling argument."
978,This show got shit quick.
979," George finally gets his Smartphones!          faito       Whats Tarzan up to?  Oh this is when he found squinty.      We gonna get a look at Tarzan Land?  Wow he has a lot of workers.      Oh shit Tarzan building himself a harem?      Damn look at all the broken adult statues... Tarzan has been on a rampage.      Tarzan you are def starting to sound like a crazy extremeist...  more than usual that is.      Distraction?  Oh fuck...  they back door'd them!      We got ourselves a crazy ass bitch settin fires....      So they are lureing out the people... uh oh...      LETS GO MELONLORD!  LURE THEM AWAY!      Wait they want to nab her?  Uh oh... dont get caught Melonlord...      Oh shit the chlorine gas.  RUN MELONLORD!  DONT GET GASSED!      Damn Senku with the rescue.  Thats ballsy.      Oh damn squinty sacked his goons and they ded now...  but now he knows for sure Senku has science.      So whats the plan now?  So no bat shit, no revival fluid and no gunpoweder.      So plan B?  New weapons?  Nope attack first huh?  Lets go!      CELL PHONES! GEORGE FINALLY GETS HIS SMARTPHONE!      DOUBLE ANGENTS OUT THERE!? GEORGE AND MOE-CHAN!      Making phones huh?  AThis is gonna be one hell of a leap.      Tarzan is shook after hearing Senku is alive.  Good, FEEL THE FEAR!"
980,"""this wind...death""?  really?  getting tired of shit like this"
981,"I'm not sure how communications will save the day. I mean, it's useful but surely just getting all your dudes and throwing them at the village would still work out. Some primitive rafts to make sure they can't get out and you can just starve them to death. Even with all the intel Senku can get, if Tsukasa's big army sticks together, there's not much chance.     I guess maybe with perfect intel, they can lay traps and wage a guerrilla war, but even so....."
982,"Tsukasa has some good points, I don't really like the world we live in. His world seems more equal, as long as he can rule it properly. I think I would take his side."
983,"His world is even less equal than our own and he’s nothing more than a hypocrite, only hating the previous world because he wasn’t in charge.     He wants to be a supreme ruler who keeps his power by exerting complete control over people, ideas and technological advancements.   He’s using fear and force to get his own way, a thing as a single judge, jury and executioner.     And most of all, he’s willing to use force to enslave or kill the existing society of people who are far more removed from the supposed evil old society than every single person he’s resurrecting."
984,He hasn't said or done anything yet to really assume any of those things.
985,Of course he has. Every action shown and everything he said has been evidence of it.
986,"  Killed Senku because his ideals contradicted his own in how civilization would form    Has so far only revived young people - and specifically those whom he can bully into obeying him or else are strong and dumb enough to agree with him    Has actively murdered dozens if not hundreds of petrified adults, almost all of whom have almost certainly done nothing to deserve it, out of his own personal ideology    Is active ruler of his clan, giving him all the power    Sent an army to destroy Ishigami village regardless of whether Senku was there or not."
987,That's still not showing signs that he has bad intentions. We haven't seen how he treats his people yet.
989,I do not regret reading that spoiler and more than that I am not even surprised.

991,ok is this anime good???
992," Wow, what a anime!   r KiraQueenTouchedThat comments dtij7b  "
993,tsukasa in early episodes: i don't want adults because they're going to make the world corrupt again :     tsukasa now: im going to surround myself witH BIGGEsT bULKIEST adULt tHUGS and you can't stop me
994,"They aren’t adults, they are jojo teens"
995,Fitting since Tsukasa is basically a pillar man.
996,Senku is absolutely fucked if he hears the pillar men song
997,You seem to be under the impression Senku couldn't make a piano.
998,The question is if he can tune one.
999,Yes he can. I'm not musical by any means but I can  likely  tune a piano it's pure physics... And well you know that's his thing. I would likely take 1 billion seconds for me to tune it though.
1000,It's already been established that Senku isn't good at things that take that kind of skill though. And there's a reason you should pay an expert to tune your piano.
1001,"See my comment to Colopty, he  very very likely  could."
1002,It would take you 31.71 calendar years to tune a piano?
1003,"Well I'm not 1 billion per cent sure of that. Reality would likely be a week, including a good microphone a pc with Matlab  or something that can do FFT on an audio file  and a test piano that I can destroy. Although if you can tune 1 key with this method you can basically tune the piano since it's rinse and repeat."
1004,"You'd think so, but a piano is practically the only instrument that musicians don't really tune on their own  aside from certain instruments that never need tuning  as it turns out to be a really hard task. It's really not recommended to try doing it without being trained as a piano technician."
1005,"You could do it with an FFT analysis of each note. Seriously he could. He would need a good  microphone and a computer  or advanced calculator . But he could probably even create an extraordinary test setup that omits all that. I'm an engineer by trade and I actually had to create a xylophone by doing FFT analysis as an assignment. An xylophone is easy compared to the piano, but the concept for tuning is almost the same. Senku could do it."
1006,The chances of him getting his hands on a computer to do any sort of frequency analysis for him any time soon seems slim.
1007,DUN DUN
1008,AYAYAYAY
1009,For me that just means someone is calling my phone
1010,Please tell me you do a glorious pose when you answer
1011,I usually dance over to the phone and delay picking it up even if Im right next to me
1012,My personal headcannon is that Dr.Stone and Jojo take place in the same universe.
1013,Tsukasa has possibly revived the ultimate life form??
1014,hahah good point xd
1016,"By adult, he meant boomer, I guess"
1017,Taking “ok boomer” to a whole new level
1018,"More like ""KO, boomer""."
1019,"  To shreds, boomer!  "
1020,"Ok, KO!"
1021,This needs to be a new anime meme lol
1022,"this is the ultimate ""okay boomer"" move"
1023,"Wait, is Tsukasa actually our guy?"
1024,"yeah this episode was pretty convincing that Senku is childish genius and Tsukasa is the adult extremist, even if they start waking people up, if they wake up lets say half the Yakuza by not paying attention to who they awaken Senku could easily find himself turned into a slave scientist by people who will do worse than Tsukasa"
1025,"...or Senku would just run circles around anyone who tried to enslave him because he's almost as much of a genius at strategy as he is at science. Senku's an  idealist , he isn't childish, stupid, or naive. It's a bit early to say Senku is dumb enough to awaken a bunch of Yakuza before he can handle it, considering they've awakened exactly no one and we have no idea what system they'll have in place when they start."
1026,"The thing is you don't really know who you awaken unless they have a  certain feature you know, and I doubt Senku and friends would be aware who even were criminals, so in reality they could awaken dozens of people and eventually the awakened people would do exactly as Tsukasa said and organize and get the drop on Senku when his guard is down. I think Tsukasa and Senku should make a deal and sort a way to tell who to awaken and who to leave as stone, otherwise a few trackless bad decisions would ruin the utopia they were given."
1027,"Isn't that exactly what Tsukasa has done?  He's waking up random people and forcing them to live in his Empire.  All he does is kill the people he can tell are adults and recruit the fighter she knows as his HRs.    Plus if Senku started reviving people he'd likely have some sort of defense in place rather than just trusting them.  Keep in mind they have Gen who would likely see through most lies, along with Senku who saw through Gen.  It's unlikely they'll get tricked easily, and anyways Senku can just make a lie detector."
1028,"Its its actually exceedingly easy to figure out who is a criminal and who can be brought back... To a certain degree. You cant know for sure with every person but if you are smart about it than it is far from impossible.     Step one, find someone you know, class mate, teacher, mother, father, etc. Once they are awake you have them tell you who each person they know is. By using this voucher system you can quickly find many people who are probably not criminals.     Step two. Find people who know all the criminals. Ie detectives, journalists, victims to previous crimes, anyone who might have connections to some degree. You can now narrow down who should be woken up last... And when you wake them, its inside of a cell.     Its not fool proof, some will slip through your fingers. But by the time you get to waking anyone questionable... Like a mob boss or serial killer, you should already have several cops revived as well as other safe guards thought up and in place."
1029,"I think the idea fails early on because as kids you don't know  everything     lets say you awaken your teacher, he was always nice to you right? well, that might have been just a personality he wanted to show to you while there were laws, and an adult seeing a bunch of children while the adult had to hold himself back in society, only to see that a bunch of weak looking kids and tribesman are around, he'd try to take advantage of them. Ofc you could say even friends could do this, but in reality that could very well be the case, Tsukasa got betrayed by one of the 1st people he awakened after all.     The best way to approach this would be to awaken friends and family, show them that Senku has technology and Tsukasa has the power, and then ask them if they are willing to cooperate and serve their predecided role, if they refuse, exile them in a random direction. You have to show you have a bad side as well as a good side, otherwise its just not realistic to expect people to start working for your science fair."
1030,"I THINK they are trying to setup the fact that Tsukasa is just paying lip-service to his ideals and is actually quite hypocritical and corrupted by his power, but yeah, it does look like Tsukasa is the thinker here rather than Senku, if only because Senku hasn't even attempted to engage with Tsukasa philosophically. Maybe that's going to happen, at some point?"
1031,Only if you think anarcho primitivism is good. He's already pretty much broken the way he wants things to work by havin Just because he wants to destroy the old power structures that oppressed people doesn't make his ideology good or right. Pretty easy to argue that it's actually more likely to create inequality.
1032,"Pretty much, yeah. If you consider his reason for hating adults is that they're rich, corrupt, and would go right back to claiming all the world's resources for themselves, there's no reason he'd have anything against a bunch of buff 20-something street thugs who are happy to live as cavemen."
1033,I still find it hard to believe that there were enough extremely bulky ugly bastards to make an army just lying around intact for him to revive        ohfuck 
1034,"Tsukasa  was  a national level martial artist, he probably knows where the big boys hang out lmao"
1035,THICC BOYS
1037,"You don't get that sort of body in just months, no matter how good your bodybuilding program is."
1039,"That's true, but given the time it takes to bulk up like that the majority of people he'll find with that kind of build are going to be older than he'd like."
1041,"Gen is actually supposed to be a bit older than Senku, so not really high school age, but your point still stands"
1042,Maybe Senku also gave him the recipe for anabolic steroids.
1043,"Considering body builders are some of the chillest dudes around, Tsukasa's army of goons just makes no sense outside the realm of anime!"
1044,"Here's the thing, those might be high schoolers for all we know. Have you seen Tsukasa himself? Body proportions make no sense in this show."
1045,Something something killing a lion with a fist.
1046,Which isn't nearly as impressive as Suika's Samus skills.
1047,Well a teen strong enough to take down a lion easily and easily able to stop a arrow in midair is hard to believe so in the end even if the anime is science based it's still anime so everything can't make sense.
1048,"Right, which is why we don't know if the thugs are adults or not"
1049,"Except   technically   those aren't impossible feats.  Difficult, yes, impossible?  Not really. Though it is really flashy to get the point that Tsukasa is insanely powerful across yea."
1050, hides in melon 
1051,"This is an anime, those thugs could still be high school kids..."
1052,Clearly it's like most people never watched Cromartie High School before. Most of the casts are made up of high school delinquents that look way older than the students.
1053,He... HE JUST ATE MY PENCIL
1054,"Given their intelligence I'd say middle school, maybe upper elementary."
1055,"Nah, those are clearly teenagers from the JoJo universe."
1056,They look like the henchmen you see in the One Piece universe.
1057,If they came from JoJo's universe they wouldn't be so dumb.
1058,Those guys are all probably around 20-25 years old. It's just that Tsukasa is shit at phrasing  just as he is shit at creating an ideology .
1059,Or they just didn't tell him their age... Would you tell him your age if he just woke you up randomly?
1060,"you are probably right, and i understand that its anime and all but 20-year olds wouldn't look like that xdd  their faces look old"
1061,"They are jsut ugly motherfuckers. I remember the other day I was at a third time  an after play party  and the rugbiers in their twenties all had faces like they were more than 30 years old. Being very buff and rought kinda makes you look older, plus how you style your hair, dress, etc."
1062,Tsukasa-adjusted age = age in years minus bicep size in centimeters.
1063,"yeah he didn't make sense back then and even less t´sense now... but i guess japan has a infinite number of psychopathic maniacs who look like 30, are actually 15 and have no problem killing all of their adult relatives!  not to mention about 4 billion other people... you know super genocide because, why not? "
1064,Ikr lol if this is what he meant by innocent youth than I guess everyone around senku are innocent 7 year old kids.
1065,"Tsukasa is the problem of this series for me, he DOESN'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE in this type of story ; "
1066,"Keep in mind Tsukasa doesn't look like a teenager at first glance.  I would assume he was an adult if I didn't know that he's supposed to be a teenager.  Hence that should work for the other people he's reviving.    Besides, why would they actually tell him that they're not ""pure"" children??  ""Oh yea I'm an adult""   dies   is basically how it would go."
1067,"Big tough idiots are  zero  threat to Tsukasa, provide him with needed manpower, and he can always dispose of them later.     It may not be ideal but it still makes perfect sense, especially when he knows he will have to conquer Ishigami Village and can probably guess if there is one human population there could well be more."
1068,"He's doing the exact same thing he swore to destroy, but this time he'll be on the top."
1069,I mean can we really actually tell how old they are? I assumed they were around his own age
