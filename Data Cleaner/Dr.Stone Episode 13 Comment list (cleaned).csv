1,"Is anyone else curious about where this season is gonna end now? I thought the season would end just after the tournament arc with the Manga Spoilers""Village origins story"" But it seems like we're going a bit too fast for that. Where do manga readers think we're gonna end on?"
2,"When it was confirmed for 24 episodes I did some shitty math and at the rate it was going I predicted it was going to end after Huge Manga Spoilers""The stone wars arc after Tsukasa dies"""
3,I think that's way too far. I'm thinking about halfway to that point.
4,"We're up to about chapter 34 and Manga spoiler""The Stone wars arc ends at about 75-ish I believe. And I can't remember any really good stopping points before then"""
5,"I just feel it would really have to rush to get that far. A few stopping points I think would work although I think at least a few of these will be before ep 20 would be when manga spoiler""they play the phonograph, OR when they use the radio for the first time."""

9,I wonder if the comments are gonna get salty about how this fight ends.
10,"Almost certainly, this'll end kinda similar to how Demon slayer's episode 19 ended and I was pretty salty then too lol"
11,I'm anime-only and I'm already salty. It's pretty obvious how it will end given how the episode went down. Will it really be that same old trope though?
12,Can't wait for Ruri mystery reveal. It is so good.
13,  Original comment by /u/Gantz87 |  Top-level comment     ---    Anime only watchers.... shits about to happen. Fasten your seatbelts lolol    ---     This message was posted by a bot because originally submitted  outside of the Source Material Corner. 
14,"Man they dropped a lot of small scenes that would have helped viewers understand jokes and scenes better. As an adaptation we were bound to lose stuff in episodes where we shouldn't but man, too bad."
15,What jokes and scenes? I feel like I understood everything.
16,"They delve deeper into the making of the drug in the manga, they show more ""between scene"" which tie things without making the whole thing seem rushed. For instance, it's easy to understand that Suika got all the way up there, but seeing her going up there is way  better for pacing's sake. Removing lots of those small panels reduces the whole feeling of the story. For instance he old dude kaseki? Can never remember his name speaks and acts a bunch less in the anime compared to the manga, which has funny scenes with him getting excited every time he tries something new."
17,"  For instance, it's easy to understand that Suika got all the way up there, but seeing her going up there is way better for pacing's sake.    I don't understand this sentence. What are you talking about?    As an anime only everything seems fine to me. I know that source readers may be annoyed by small changes I was there but I don't think anything of value was lost."
18,"  As an anime only everything seems fine to me. I know that source readers may be annoyed by small changes      See, that's why I avoid actually talking about anime. I give an answer and the only reasonable answer people find everytime is ""oh come on, you're making it bigger than it is"". Every time people refuse to think about what they enjoy.    I told you there were changes, which altered the way the story is seen as well as disrupts the pacing. I made my case clearly, didn't say anything out of line or even said anything that could be contested, yet the only answer I get is ""iss fine""    And what do you mean you don't understand? They rushed every scene and I gave you an example that was rushed and easy to remember through the manga, because Suika is in constant action during the manga, from the river to the village, to the top of the pole, talking to others while assessin the situation of the fight, to the top of the hill, and to finish down the hill. In itself it doesn't weigh anything on the story but they kept making changes to the way every scene's flow went to be able to finish the season where they want it to. So what I'm critizing here for instance is that they lenghtened the early part for good and sensible reasons, anime means movement is able to be portrayed easily where she goes back to the village, but they rushed through the rest of it all. In the manga Suika's recovering from her efforts at the top of the pole while explaining that he can't see well. There is a conversation had, and because it's a manga, the author shows her making a decision to help him in a panel and the next panel being on the next page he can do the ""trick"" that every mangaka in shonen does: present something ""surprising"" straight at the beginning of a page you just flipped. She's standing at the top of the hill, ready to barrel down and send her helmet. That works in manga format especially here since it is used to great effect to show how efficiently and quickly she made it to the top of the hill. Whoever said ""wow how did you get there"" enhances this whole idea of quickness and resolve she had, also people aren't supposed to get too close to the priestess, so it adds to it too.    Meanwhile in the anime, when they could have shown her using her acrobatics or whatever to   portray such speed and resolve  , they just skip straight to it. The line I mentioned is wasted on the moment, and the viewer gets something a lot less entertaining.      I guess I really need to explain the entire thought process of how scenes flow together every time I write on here.     ¯  _ツ_/¯ Yet it's as simple as taking a step in front of the other. I'll say it again: they have no choice for pacing's sake to cut some things, but here is an example of a poor choice from the studio, which lessens the scenes around Kinro's fight, that is obviously the main point of the tournament. And once again,   it's not just the one snippet I talked about that was changed, a LOT was changed and in this episode, it does end up making the whole thing look rushed and poorly adapted  "
19,  And what do you mean you don't understand?    I don't understand your sentence structure. It's really hard to read. It's all over the place.     I went to the manga. I genuinely don't know what is your problem with the scene. They pretty much did panel to panel adaptation.       Every time people refuse to think about what they enjoy.       I guess I really need to explain the entire thought process of how scenes flow together every time I write on here. ¯ ツ/¯    You can drop that condescending tone if you're gonna talk with me. It makes you look like you belong to /r/iamverysmart.      it does end up making the whole thing look rushed and poorly adapted    I'm pretty sure it's your personal problem and REALLY subjective feeling. Pace of the manga strongly depends on your reading speed and imagination. It may be not the same like in the manga but thankfully good adaptation rarely are 1:1.
20,"Sorry to butt in, but I kind of get the point in that complain:     First, the process for ""explaining"" the steps required for preparing the drug were ""fast paced"" in some way. Not that I find it particullarly a nuisance since I could read the subs and see the images, but I would completely believe someone claiming about those scenes going ""too fast"" for their taste/compared for the time you read the same on manga.    Second, the Suika scene. While still impactfull, I also felt a faint ""curious to be showed that way"". Scene in question: From Suika on top of the pole to Suika near the priestess for charging to lend Ginro her helmet. The thought process for Suika doing so was lackijng a bit: The reason, Ginro was forcing his eyes--  sick eyes like hers, was obviously showed so its ok. But it felt kind of flat that after that, a brief exchange with Senku in the middle, she bound towards the priestess.    That said, the adaptation, I guess, is better to be taken only by the elemts it shows unless there are omitted ones who clarify the plot or motivations. What I mean: First, the priestess' hut wasn't protrayed by the anime as a place so sacred that almost no one could be near that, so its not inmersion breaking for Suika to go jumping there in the anime. Not sure if in the manga, that hut importance is showed or was info dump. Sure. Given all the info the manga provides to this point in anime, it fits better the ""page change effect"" and Suika suddenly appearing near the priestess, instead the road the adpatation chose which isn't bad for my tastes."
21,"Now, this is proper explanation. I still don't really agree but I see your point.       First, the priestess' hut wasn't protrayed by the anime as a place so sacred that almost no one could be near that    I feel like they portrayed that pretty good. From the beginning I saw that place as sacred."
22,"I felt the place as important, but not sacred. Since, while not convoluted, there were some ""visitors"" here and there beside her father and mother ?. Not the ""sacred"" levels as, lets say, holy ground you cant put your filthy feet on. Which is more or less the implied level Suika 'broke'."
23,"As someone who read the manga, it doesn't  feel  like I missed anything. Even then, this season needs to finish up the Arc name""stone wars arc"" before it ends."
24,"That was so over the top when Kinro got the mask, loved it!     laughter"
25,"Screw Super Saiyan, screw Bankai, screw Gears, we have GLASSES."
26,"And Kinro becomes the Stone Worlds Megane-kun. boys and girls who like""guys in glasses, don't despair at Watermelon Kamen. It gets a  lot  better for you folks."""
27,"""yeah but he's doesn't get much screentime afterwards"""
28,This show makes me feel so powerful lol     SPORTS     mugistronk
29, Screw Super Saiyan     Well glasses did give him Ultra Instinct
30, Super Melon Warrior!      mugistronk
31,Anyone else think of Captain Melonhead?
32,"Ah yes, the greatest hero turned villain story ever told"
33,Literally the only thing I can think about! I miss the Eds...
34,Bow before the melon lord 
35,Wait how the hell are there two planks?
36,That's a decoy plank with decoy Johnny 2x4
37,Super melon warrior   super sayiaman !!!
38,"What is this from? I see it all the time, and I'm curious."
39,{K-On!}
40,"When he was dodging Magma's blows, I was getting serious King Crimson vibes."
41,GALASSU you mean.
42,GURASSU
43,Best pose he could have made.
44,"I was immediately reminded of that Fairly Odd Parents episode with kid King Arthur when he gets his glasses.    ""I can see!""     rips off shirt, is super buff     ""I CAN FIGHT!"""
45, Put your grasses on 
46,They made that scene even more badass and stupid then it was in the manga
47,It's a good thing that his prescription was the same as Suika's.
48,
49,Fuck someone please upload this manga panel because I feel like it's fire af
50,All I could think of when I saw the pose.
51,/r/Megane motherfuckers
52,Gears?
53,Kinro was like : I can’t beat the shit out of you without seeing better.
54,"The music, the posing, the sakuga, the epic speech and even the background commentary. Everything was perfect.     gintamathispleasesme"
55,"I love how this anime makes us hyped about legit but normal now science stuff    Electricity one, glasses one and now this"
56,"And they will not have to go centuries before bifocals now. Invented by Benjamin Franklin who also did the lightning rod, and Franklin Stove a massive improvement over a fire place for heating. Many more inventions including the wonderful to me sounding Glass harmonica. And he won American Revolution by getting France to join the war in large part because he had sex with every important lady in the French Court no matter their looks. He is credited with saying ""All cats are grey in the dark"" ;"
57,There's still so much science left  The show has made me love science even if its little
58,Reminds me of the 4 guys on the couch
59,"I only would have wished the OP played, but that track was great."
60,"""I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer.""    ""...why? You have a spear.""    ""Yes but I'm also shortsighted."""
61,Melon Mask! suika no kamen
62,My first thought was Kamen Rider Gaim
63,  Gaim    So basically this was literally a Suika Arms reference?
64,... I feel like I'm angry I didnt get that before.
65,Elon Musk: did somebody call my name?
66,"To Musk: No, go away"
67,"""Who the hell was that creep"" Roasted"
68,Kamen Rider KINRO
69,I actually got chills it was so great
70,Literally Jojo.
71,It almost felt like a Jojo episode.
72,SUIKAMEN WARRIOR
73,THE EYES OF SCIENCEE!!!!
74,I thought I was watching JoJo for a second there.
75,That reaction shit was gold
76,The comedy this episode was glorious.    Ginro and Senku violently licking Kinro was amazing.
77,"THIS IS THE TASTE OF A FAIR FIGHTER, KINRO!"
78,  Rero Rero Rero intensifies  
79,"""I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one   kick   nut shot 10,000 times.""    Chrome going to win for sure with that level of dedication!"
80,His ancestor had also participated in a tournament that held the fate of Earth  realm   at stake.
81,Also Ruri knowing Senku's name made me want to go binge read the manga today. I think I can hold out for the rest of the season. Please pray for me.
82,"Yo, that was a GIANT mystery drop, what the hell was that?"
83,"There was a hint that she knew about life before the petrification before. I don't actually remember what it was, but this wasn't the first clue."
84,the priestess know some stuff and that was passed down - yeah that part's okay but SPECIFICALLY SENKU?
85,"That's the impression I got as well. If that is the case, then it would mean one of Senku's acquaintances awoke centuries earlier than him and became the first priestess."
86,"Doesn’t seem that crazy really when you figure that whoever it was that woke up and started the village would have been someone from the same general geographical area that was alive at the same time. Granted the chances of knowing a random person from your city is pretty small, but it seems likely that the subset of people who would be capable of starting a city is both much smaller and probably somewhat more likely to know someone like Senku."
87,Also I figure that someone with his highly unorthodox looks and personality would make him very recognizable to anyone in his area. Dude's probably a minor local celebrity.
88,Arent they pretty far aways from their city tho?
89,"Dont worry, all questions will get answered"
90,"Ruri told the villagers about the a modified version of the famous Japanese folklore tale ""Momotaro"". Kohaku mentions that all the big words she knows is because of Ruri reciting the 100 stories. These stories prove that there was someone unpetrified that was able to pass down this knowledge."
92,"Some people in the area had to have unpetrified to start the village. Those people would have spoken Japanese. Over centuries years their language should have changed substantially, but being a small, isolated community could slow that I guess.     I originally said 3700 years, but the village couldn't have been around the whole time."
93,"  Over centuries years their language should have changed substantially, but being a small, isolated community could slow that I guess.    Actually, it's the opposite. The more isolated and insular a community is, the more likely it is for the language to rapidly change - in a small community, a single person changing how they speak will reach a larger portion of the community and have a greater chance of causing others in the community to follow suit.    But that said, even then it would still take several centuries for the change in language to be substantial enough to really matter.    For example, take English and Scots. Scots is  sort of  its own language, but it's also  sort of  a dialect of English.    It's distinct enough from British English that many linguists do consider it a separate language. But at the same time, it's still close enough to British English that most native English speakers can understand a decent amount of it.    Here is a video of lecture about the Scots language being given in Scots. You have to really pay attention, but if you take your time, you'll find that you'll be able to understand most of what he says.    Scots began to diverge from English around the 7th century, and it wasn't until the end of the 15th century that the shift had become dramatic enough that people began considering it a new language.    Thus - unless the founders of that village were unpetrified at least 1000 years prior to the show - I think it's fair to assume that the language hasn't drifted far enough that it's unrecognizable by a Japanese speaker."
94,Interesting! And I think there has been some evidence of them speaking sightly differently. I think I remember someone in the comments pointing out that a village was throwing out some random English words that Senku would then translate via rephrasing what had been said.
95,Why would a book specifically mentioning Senku be preserved?
96,"Didn't they allude to her mother telling her stuff? We know they're the descendents of  someone  who woke up before Senku. Maybe his dad woke up somewhere else, found someone, had kids, and spread the Gospel of Senku, our savior and bringer of the Great Truth, science."
97, Didn't they allude to her mother telling her stuff?     Because her mom was the previous priest. These stories have been past down for quite some time.
98,"I think she has hold of his library, research, diary, notes, or something.    Or his elementary school books lmao"
99,I think it's how they mentioned that Ruri told the others about old Japanese legends and the names of some video games and animals not in Japan.
100,"I think because of the 100 stories, the priestess and only the priestess knows about the old world, i don't know how that would relate to her knowing about Senku, but i imagine it has some connection we yet don't know to him."
101,I’m guessing it’s related to the villagers knowing of things they haven’t seen like gorilla that they touched on a few episodes ago
107,"His name is probably in one of the 100 stories the priestesses are supposed to memorize. However, I'm curious who originally recorded his name"
108,"It 100% has to do with the ""passed down"" traditions they have, she's the ""prophet"" or ""priestess"" or whatever, remember?"
110,"I mean, I'm not going to spoil the surprise, I'm just very surprised about this development."
111,I think it's related to how she's supposed to memorize stories similar to how one of the villagers knew of momotaro. Maybe there was a tale of him as a crazy science kid throughout school similar to how senku knew of the tarzan kid before he betrayed senku.
113,Seeing the massive quality of the anime is the only thing holding me back from reading the manga.
114,"While the anime is quite well adapted. The author of Dr. Stone is really known for his detailed art which cannot be 1-1 replicated in the anime, so that’s a good enough reason alone to read it. Dr. Stone thankfully doesn’t suffer much if you read ahead as the story is more about of an adventure type of thing that doesn’t detract from the imaginative ways they invent science things."
115,"Yes but the music, Senku and Ginro VA's and the sound elevate the show a lot more.    Also i cant think of avideogame OST that i could use to read Dr Stone."
116,  Also i cant think of avideogame OST that i could use to read Dr Stone.    Just read it to Dr. Stone's OST.
117,But that makes me wanna see the anime.
118,"Fuck, the OST is so good I might just buy it when the season ends. Thanks for linking it, I didn't even know it was on Spotify."
119,Minecraft?
120,Haha no.
122,What?
123,"Oh my, yes, Ginro's VA is absolutely perfect. He alone is a solid enough reason to watch the show."
124,Seriously. Boichi and Murata are from a different species in terms of their work. Their art is just super clear
125,"Funny that Inagaki sensei's two works have been illustrated one by Murata ES 21, the other by Boichi Dr. Stone."
126,"Yeah, I'll probably read it from chapter 1 as soon as the anime stops airing"
127,Oh god fine I read it. But I want to resist. I can’t. I have same problem with Vinland Saga :
128," known for detailed art which cannot be 1-1 replicated    Tell that to DP after taking on the monumental task of adapting Jojo. Boichi is no Miura, even if his work is incredibly detailed, and it seems to be doing just fine with what's given."
129,After I found out it was 24 episode I'm still holding off to because the anime has been pretty good.
130,"The manga is still even better. It's not one of those things where the art was shit but they redrew it well. The anime is competent, but a definite step down."
131,Try to avoid spoilers until you finish the season. Then go read the manga. The art is way too good compared to the anime
132,I couldn't make it and let me tell you the manga is so good.
133,"Same, I'm getting really tired of getting plot-blocked by those guards"
134,Which chapters did this episode cover? I'm also ready to binge.
135,Start at 34
136,"IMO the wait is worth it.    Hold on tight, you can make it!"
137,RIGHT?! That was a crazy reveal!    It’s so hard to avoid spoilers right now!    I need next weeks episode now!
138,"ugh me too that scene got me looking for where the anime left off XD I have a guess: the person who told them about that Anime  i don't remember in which episode, but chrome and kohaku made a ref they can't possibly know unless someone from Senku's Era told them could have told Ruri about Senku.."
139,"I dont know Japanese so I googled what ""Ishi"" means which is what she starts to say and apparently it means Doctor."
140,"This comment made me look up the kanji for his name. According to what I can decipher through Wiktionary it literally means Stone God. Senku seems to be Sen=thousand, ku=space    His name is pretty fitting for his character"
141,That is a cool detail!
142,It also means stone.
143,How you guys manage to avoid manga spoilers amazes me. I don't know when and how but i unfortunately know exactly whats going on :
144,"Its not too hard: I'm pretty peculiar on what I google and who I follow on social media. I'm not 100% spoiler free though. My curiosity gets the better of me and my eyes wander when I'm looking for something specific. The two main things I've been somewhat spoiled on are:  Light Spoilers""I saw Kinro's glasses but I'm not sure where they come in and I wasn't expecting Melon head Kinro lol. and The name of the Village.""  Is Senku's last name a spoiler? I legitimately don't remember if I they said it in the show before or not. I just remember Senku telling Tsukasa that family names don't matter."
145,There were hints in the episodes that Ruri was from his age. Knowing him of course is a stretch but it didn't come as a big surprise to me.
146,"What are you doing here, Touma?"
147,Imagine Breaker prevented the petrification from setting in
148,"Bruh, he would have died 3600 years ago then."
149,"Nah death is imaginary too, he broke it."
150,He broke the illusion of death
151,"But imagine living 3600 years nearly all alone or however long it would take for a village to form while seeing buildings and all signs of humanity deteriorate around you, knowing what greatness humanity once achieved yet being unable to recreate it?    Wouldn't that be the most  misfortunate  thing of all?"
152,  Wouldn't that be the most misfortunate thing of all?    Then one day they'll have to meet Honshou Aru.
153,Nah.
154,Even without the deterioration just living that long can be misfortune see: the Endymion movie.
155,"It's his descendant, obviously!"
156,Not if imagine breaker can beat death itself ¯   _ツ _/¯
157,Maybe.. Just maybe...
158,"Well I mean, only if the petrification was somehow supernatural in nature.    If it was purely scientific or biological then Imagine Breaker would do jack shit."
159,"Oh, of course!"
160,"Touma living for 3700 years might be possible, but him just standing there without destroying some fucked up illusions? Nope, that's a fake."
161,Waiting to see Senku invent a certain railgun of science
162,Senku is a one man Academy city if you think about it.
163,"Only without the horrific child experimentation, really."
164,"Did you see him terrifying a poor little girl with vivid descriptions of nasty acids and bases?    Just a step before creating 20,000 clones I think."
165,"I would have said you're right, but then I remembered his famous do is actually him spending time on it with gel. That ain't his natural hairstyle."
166,He came to punch some women.
167,A wild Salt Bae appeared!     salt
168,That's the second Salt Bae reference I've seen so far. Black Clover being the first.
169,There was also one in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime.
170,"Compared to the others, the DR. Stone one was unapologetically saltbae"
171,"I wish I had started taking screenshots when I first saw one, I swear I could make a huge collage by now. they just  love  that guy"
172,There was also one in Sho-bitch
173,That dude sounds a lot like the VA for Sanji
174,God damn that power pose after putting on the Eyes of Science.     Whodathunk Kinro would unintentionally give the best possible advertisement for the Kingdom of Science in the first round of the bout.
175,Man straight up gained ultra instinct from the eyes of science.
176,  Ultra Instinct theme and Ultimate Battle intensifies  
177,This some boruto chuunin exams shit
178,I hope he actually wins and it's not him being DQ'd because of the 'outside' help. But at least Magma will be all beat up for his next match or even the final match? I actually may start the manga now T_T
179,Looks like Kinro won here. And there's no obstacle left to win for the guys lol. Most likely than not he's getting disqualified.
180,"With the next episode titled ""Master of Flame,"" I'm worried that it's not over and Senku will be fighting with a flamethrower or something."
181,I want Senku to do some over the top anime attack name shouting while tossing fireballs or some shit to convince all his opponents to give up out of fear.
182,"Of course it's not over because this is not the final, but I guess they will animate other fights as well."
183,"I wonder if you can fight with any weapon you want, might be easy for Senku with a few bombs or mines"
184,"I was thinking Senku could throw a vial of sleeping gas into the center of the ring, incapacitating both himself and Magna for the rest of the tournament. Or just Magna, if he wears a gas mask."
185, accidentally uses a tear gas bomb      everyone dies     F to humanity's last resort
186,Itchy powder?
187,He had a crossbow long ago that he used against Tsukasa. Seems like easy wins if any weapon is allowed
188," I wonder if you can fight with any weapon you want    If they can, Senku's fight would go like this."
189,I think it the title unlikely is for Senku. If I'm not mistaken he was matched up with Kohaku for the first round.
190,I mean the smith spits fire in the opening which also scares me
191,I think he would be the one using that flamethrower.
192,"Well, considering the fact that their main opponent is Magma. And as you mentioned the next episode is called ""Master of Flame"". Magma is probably a Dragonborn. Which is the only logical conclusion."
193,I can smell some shit where it looked like Magma lost but he's going to pull some underhanded tactics to win in the end.
194,"He's definitely getting DQ'd. They set it up earlier in the episode that any outside help would result in DQ. Magma will be weakened though, and probably end up in the final with Chrome. They wouldn't have shown Chrome practicing his nut-shot if he wasn't going to use it."
195,Chekhov's Nutshot
196,"I feel like you've almost contradicted yourself there. If Kinro wins here, there are no obstacles left to their victory - which makes for a pretty unexciting story. Narratively, it makes way more sense for Kinro to get disqualified and Magma to continue being an obstacle."
197,"Glad I'm not the only one who caught that. The conversation with Mantle holding up the rocks was definitely meant to set this up. If you can't throw rocks into the ring, you can't throw eyeglass melons. Hopefully winning by a technicality after getting his ass rocked will humble Magma somewhat, but somehow I'm not seeing that in the cards."
198,"I wouldn't be surprised if he was DQ'eq, putting on a magic hat and suddenly becoming much stronger is straight up sorcery."
199,"The way it was set up is that direct help is forbidden, but indirect help is okay. I'm guessing it will be legal by the rules"
200,Ah fuck you’re probably right. I forgot this was an anime for a minute
201,"My hope is that he beats the crap out of Magma but gets DQed. Then in the next round, Chrome vs Magma, Magma is so injured its actually a fair fight. Chrome wins and whoever is on team science that makes it to the final round just takes the fall and lets Chrome win so he can marry Ruri."
202,Am I the only one who unironically felt this scene was cool as fuck?    This show really makes us take a hard look at all the things we take for granted.
203,I agree but its just a little weird seeing a man in a watermelon helmet look this badass.
204,Presentation is so good that even man wearing watermelon looks cool
205,I now wish they amke glasses in stone age with just watermelons or other fruits now
206,The whole point of that scene was that he does NOT look badass to everyone else there
207,That’s only because they didn’t see the explosion
208,If only they had the eyes of science!
209,CG-eye
210,The music... THE GODDAMN MUSIC!!!! That shit is hype af!!!
211,"For real, I hope the audio/music director for this show gets a massive raise, because the OST is fucking amazing."
212,"Ive listened to the whole soundtrack. As a manga reader  the song ""Master of minds""  i hope will be used on one very hype scene. But i aint sure if we can reach it with just 24 episodes."
213,mrw    10/10 series.
214,Too bad Suika couldn't see any of this
215,"she felt it tho, and she was happy to be useful   -  "
216,Bruh
217,"""Man I sure hope my mask landed on his head instead of just getting smashed against the ground."""
218,"Golden Watermelon    B-Class Hero, Rank 76"
219,Kinro be like
220,"Damn, that's perfect."
221,"It was as ridiculous as it was awesome, I was laughing out loud the whole time and yet still getting super hyped. This might actually be my favorite scene yet."
222," Can barely see a massive, muscular middle aged man that is like 2 meters away from him, but have no problems see and recognizing a small watermelon helmet in the sky, jumping and nailing the even smaller hole with his head.    It was completely over the top and a bit cheesy, but so fucking cool.     I guess now he will defeat everyone he faces, while Chrome dick punches all of his opponents. They will face each other in the final and Kinro will forfeit in Chrome favor."
223,Idk if you're replying to someone but I don't see it in the comments. The reason he could see the watermelon helmet is because of the shine in the glass. It's the reason they talked about having a golden tip on the spear bc it helps him guide where he's attacking.
224,"Even then, as someone who wears glasses... Yeah it's a stretch. But it's an awesome one."
225,"  this scene was cool as fuck    It was pure Kamen Rider, and it was  awesome ."
226,Suika’s pass combined with the OST made me stand up and cheer like I was watching Eyeshield again
227,"Eyeshield was pure hype, makes sense the same author hits all the same incredible story beats."
228,"  Eyeshield    Oh boy, this makes me feel like firing up Blood Bowl again. Eyeshield made me pick up and learn Blood Bowl using Skaven of all things."
229,"Hah, that game is amazing but  so fucking hard . Especially passes. Damn idiots, fumbling the ball all the time."
230,"It's super unintuitive. I went in expecting a football game. As I got better, I realised it's a risk-management game, similar to X-Com. Once I got that, playing the AI got much easier.    Playing humans is still difficult af though. I just want to watch my dudes hit things and pretend I'm responsible for something cool happening."
231,anyone else think this would work really well with You Say Run?
232,"Duh, everything does."
233,"Glasses make your Mikiri Counter timings better, Wolf."
234,"it was funny and badass at the same time to me, quite a unique feeling."
235,The pose helps a lot
236,"The goddamn toku/super robot music, man"
237,I watched that like 6 times    such a epic scene!!
238,"No. Even in the manga, that scene was cool as fuck. I highly disagree with the Chrome and Senku who say it's creepy."
239,YEET
240,The real MVP of this episode was suika
241,He does a legit mikiri counter on magma
242,I just loved the no-hands docking.
243,"For a secondary character,  this scene is cool as fuck"
244,I giggled like a little girl when Kinro whipped out the jojo pose with the mask on
245,Kohaku is CUTE
246,Tfw some guys are trying to make your sister drink their piss.     lolifightsback
247,  Guys    There is your problem. Time to call Homare.
248,"I need you to lick my butthole, trust me its scientific"
249,Let's hope that the cure will be safe to drink and other methods to absorb it aren't needed.    Sounan desu ka intensifies.
250,I’m sure they could rig up something like a turkey baster if they had to boof it.
251,"""How are you going to make medicine for my sister, Senku?""    ""Oh, it's really easy, I'll mix a lot of booze, these four ridiculously dangerous corrosive substances, and my piss."""
252,Is that a JoJo reference?
253,Ruri gonna drink it so smoothly you dunno whether she knows if it's piss or not.
254,i want it to be the other way around though
255,I thought it was the female Titan for a second
256,Gorilla Titan     urbansmile
257,Make sure Levi never meets Kohaku.
258,   Junji-ito flashbacks   
259,Kohaku-chan is the cutest lil girl!
260,Kinro this episode    Edit: here a jojo version of it still the same thing tho
261,That's way too fucking perfect.
262,We're a battle     SPORTS
263,Thanks for making me realize that this is literally a tournament arc.
264,"I know they are stressing that magma is a cocky bastard, but damn does that second image really personify it."
265,"Oh god, that brought up old burried teen memories I had. I didn't like that episode EXCEPT that awsome part."
266,"This is what I came here expecting to see, and I was not disappointed."
267,Your welcome :D
268,YES YES YES YES
269,Absolutely amazing
270,I actually fucking yelled that when the scene happened
271,10/10
273,Dont read spoiler people
274,"Man, this show is just so fun. I think I got the fuzzy eye sickness in that end sequence..."
275, places melon on your head 
276,I can see...I CAN FIGHT!
277,I understood that reference and look forward to the eventual meme edit someone makes with that clip.
278,This took a lot longer than I was expecting..         mug1
279,Incredibly based.
280, kannathumbs
281,This needs it's own post I swear
282,A fucking masterpiece
283,This is the best thing I've seen all day
284,Thank you for blessing us with this masterpiece.
285,"Ruri apparently knowing Senku or about Senku was extremely surprising and incredibly intriguing and I'm really looking forward to learning what exactly is going on there.    I just love how Senku and Chrome were like 'dude's full of shit' without missing a beat. He should've gotten a proper kick though.    Kinro getting the mask and winning the bout was fantastic, like hype overdrive fantastic. I'm kinda thinking that he's gonna get disqualified, though.    This episode was all around superb. I cannot get enough of the ridiculous reactions and expressions. I also love how the group was mostly able to overlook and disregard the ""sacred rules"" of the tournament because of how important its consequences are. Also Suika MVP."
286,"My only worry is best girl ran off to save melon chan and now, well, how much time will she waste trying to find her?"
287,If Magma is donezo I don't think there is any doubt that Kinrou can will it all.
288,But they set up rules about interference and I doubt that was for nothing.
289,"Oh well, yes, there is that. They might disqualify Kinrou. :"
290,"Even if Magma technically won, Kinro hopefully used his newfound accuracy to get a bunch of nutshots in to critically disable him for future rounds."
291,"They also show indirect interference and since Suika didn't touch Magma, it might count as ok."
292,"I am going to guess is probably because the name , I have no idea what his name means in Japanese but probably something from the old stories"
293, Suika MVP.    Hands down
294,"Salt bae appears again. Luckily he got Suika's glasses now, and yeah I know that that probably be the correct prescription for him, but will still work fine, he can worry about the headache later."
295,Thank you I was looking for a picture of their reactions. It’s just so perfect
296,I didn't even notice the Salt Bae reference! Thats so great!
297,does Suika's head expand to fill the melon
298,That melon can fit snugly on Suika's head while still being able to contain her entire being. Pretty sure the melon is magic.
299,The way they had Suika spin at the end I was sure they were going to transform her into a power ranger
300,Go Go Melon Rangers!
301,Genius
302,  T O U R N E M E N T      A R C !
303,At least spell it right lol
304,  T O U R N A M E N T      A R K !
305, eye twitch 
306,  T O O N A M E N T O      A A K U !
307,Perfect.
308, Perfection 
309,"All the pairs of animals on Noah’s Ark must face off until only one, the strongest, remains."
310,Oh my god this would be a great one-panel joke with that caption
311,Definitely read that in Gigguks voice lmao.
312,Leave him alone. He has the fuzzy eye sickness
313, T O U R N E M E N T
314,THIS
315,That explosion is exaggerated.... and i like it!
316,"Either that or Senku set up a bunch of explosives ahead of time in an attempt to sabotage Magma, and they just happened to go off a that moment."
317,Michael Bay would have been proud of Senku
318,That stance was all I could ask for
319,Didnt expect the explosion when Kamen Melon appeared.  Suika besto girl ftw! Kohakus face upon hearing the blinding zombie melt corpse chemicals is hilarious
320,At first I thought the explosion was their lab exploding
321,"That didnt happen in manga, which made the anime even cooler"
322,Me when Kinro is able to see perfectly with glasses that were not made for him but strikes an epic pose.
323,"Very minor spoiler""It's explained a bit later that Suika's glasses were not a perfect fit for Kinro but good enough to massively improve his otherwise terrible sight"""
324,"Makes sense. My old prescriptions hurt to wear, but are such a huge benefit over none at all."
325,"Can confirm that works. Sure, old prescriptions are an absolute pain but actually being able to see with some clarity, instead of not being able to read a computer screen a foot away from your face is so much better."
326,"Also, old prescriptions are  weaker . Suika is a serious case, she might have a  stronger  prescription, which would give Kinrou some dizziness or a headache but also an unreal sense of clarity unless it's really really far off."
327,"Well, kinda this was the first thing that came to my mind. That the same glasses are not good for everyone."
328,"Even then, the lack of peripheral vision from having a freaking melon on your head is certainly much more detrimental to the ability to fight than nearsightedness which shouldn't even be too much of an issue really, there are plenty of professional figthers who use glasses but obviously fight without glasses or contacts. Also unless the melon is a very tight fit on your head it would be swinging around as you move causing the eye holes to move around too and perhaps even move to the side or back of the head which would obviously be a massive pain in the ass while figthing.    So yeah, it's bullshit on many levels, no point really trying to make sense of it, just like Jojo sometimes you just have to accept the bullshit for the rule of cool."
329,"If your nearsighted, you could borrow another nearsighted person's glasses and it will work well enough.  On the other hand, immediately adjusting to the new eyesight? Not likely. Especially since Suika is VERY nearsighted and Into has never worn glasses before. He would totally have fishbowl vision for a while in those glasses. But you could just chalk that up to him being an experienced fighter enough to quickly overcome the distorted vision. Okay, sorry for making this long comment talking about glasses on your meme post lol."
330,"The size is the bigger issue for me, rather than the focal length.    No way the helmet would fit, and even if if did, the eye-holes would be too close together for a grown man.    As the meme says, though, I'm willing to look past the bullshit cause it was an awesome moment."
331,Maybe women in Dr.Stone do have their eyes so far away from each other rather than it being just Boichi's artstyle.
332,"Too close together? Are you sure about that? I can't tell you for sure that the eye widths on Suika and Kinro are the same, but I also wouldn't disbelieve it."
333,"Prolonged use of the unfit glasses will result in eye pain and headache, but for a short battle it's infinitely better than nothing.     signed, a life-long near sighed redditor"
334,I wear glasses. My friend wears glasses.    I tried his glasses and I couldn't see a fucking thing.
335,"1. Are you both near-sighted?    2. If yes, was it worse than wearing nothing?    Context matters."
336,"We're both nearsighted.    And holy fuck it was terrible. I couldn't see anything.    His vision is far worse than mine, btw."
337,"I mean, it's possible that two prescriptions are close enough that it helps him see far far better than he would without glasses in general, that's not the most far fetched."
338,Suika is so kawaii and was the mvp this episode    Automatic A+
339,Suikawaii
340,"We don't deserve Suika is actually pretty badass looking, right?"
341,"He's the warrior the village needs, but not the one they deserve."
342,"They'll chase him because he can take it. A rule-following watcher, a melon knight."
343,"Golden Melon, the masked fighter."
344,Anything looks badass with that pose.
345,Prove it
346,no thank you
347,"He's the coolest one there, mask or no mask. But he does look unironically amazing with the mask on.    He definitely looks like he could be a JoBro."
348,Senku boutta hit the ring fighters with some poop and science      Reminds me of Habara from Nichibros
349,"Oh I've seen that in a meme before! I should've recognized from the art style that it was Nichibros. I totally forgot about that scene and those characters. Edit: well no wonder I couldn't remember that scene at all. I apparently forgot to watch the last two episodes! I just now went and watched the whole series again including the last 2 episodes this time. Nichibros is one of my favorite comedies of all time, I can't believe I didn't finish it."
350,I guess there really isn't way around it anymore. You just earned yourself the position of best girl Suika
351,I am pretty sure that this is one of those series where they are all best girl.
352,Especially Kinro.
353,You misstype Ginro
354,Well it’s finally here TOURNAMENT ARC
355,It doesn't really seem like a typical tournament arc. Seems more like a 1v5 because everyone else is just a background character.
356,"2 more eps, max, maybe only 1. I'm still betting we know""the name of the village by the end of the next ep."""
357,I don't care if they go through it quickly I know whats ahead and if it lives up to this I'm excited
358,"Ginro, maybe  not  walk around the tournament ground singing a song about how you're fixing the matches."
359,"If Magma can brag to everyone that he's going to kill Ruri after he marries her, I think Ginro is in the clear"
360,"Yeah that shit was weird. I mean, how the hell do they let him compete? How is he even allowed to stay at the village? I mean he's strong, yeah. But they just have to call Kohaku to get him outta there."
361,"Law as we know it probably doesn't exist or codified yet, so people boasting about going to kill someone hasn't yet been criminalized in this society.     We don't even know how much authority the chief has, if he holds absolute despotic power, then it is within his rights to kill the priestess if he's willing.    People forget that it's not only science that our civilization has advanced and progressed and thus gone in the stone world.    It's our social laws and legal framework too. Imagine thousand years of rites and laws gone and now we only have young society trying to form social hierarchy for the first time"
362,"  Suika Stitch      Ruri Stitch 1      Ruri Stitch 2    This needs to be a comment face    Well this is interesting. We know one of the duties of the Priestess is to pass down and keep The Hundred Stories, a collection of stories and knowledges passed down from generation to generation. So is it possible that Senku somehow made it into these stories? But as far as we know Senku isn't really all that famous, yeah he's a genius but he's not like Tsukasa who's made TV debuts in their time. Hmmm....    As for the match though, I have a bad feeling about this. Kinro with his over the top catch of Suika's helmet and him beating down Magma was satisfying as fuck but I'm afraid that the referee might count that as interference and DQ Kinro, which I really hope does not happen."
363,Can you do a magma pose stitch aswell. Thanks
364,Here you go :
365,That is eerily 3D-like
366,They really nailed depth here.
367," him beating down Magma was satisfying as fuck    Ikr? I was honestly going crazy cause I hate Magma so much.    You bring up a good point that Ginro might be disqualified, but even if that does happen, he will beat Magma, so it might end up that along with tiring him out, Magma will also lose a bit of confidence, and lose."
368,I almost want Magma to move on just so i can see him lose to Chrome and his Infinite Nutshot technique.
369,  UNLIMITED NUTSHOT WORKS  
370,small brain: the team members take turns losing to magma to weaken him    big brain: the team members take turns beating magma and forfeiting so other people can beat him up
371,Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Nutshot Works.
372, the referee might count that as interference and DQ Kinro    I didn't think of this and now I'm worried too :/
373,"On the bright side, their original objective was to wear Magma down so that someone weaker than him might be able to win. So if he gets DQ, he at least did his part."
374,I’m hoping that with Magma out they rig it for Chrome to win since he’s the one that really likes Ruri.
375,Well they didn't use the mask on magma so idk if that counts as interference
376,whats a stitch?
377,Captured frames from when the scene is panning over someone and stitched together to create one bigger image.
378,"It's where you take multiple parts of a scene or multiple shots usually a single panning shot and ""stitch"" them together to show what the complete image looked like/would look like.    In this case, showing both the top half and bottom half of Magma, whereas you'd only see part of him at any one time."
379,"Agree that winning now would be too anticlimactic, so is unlikely to happen. Maybe they're opening up a path for Chrome to later defeat an injured Magma and win the whole thing.    The show hasn't been shy of crazy coincidences so far. I guess yet another one is that one of the founding members of the village knew Senku enough to figure he was one of humanity's best bets for the future so included him in the 100 stories."
380,Kinro's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind
381,"Yeah, I was screaming MUDA MUDA while he beat the living shit out of Magma."
382,I got Giorno's Piano Drop the moment he wears the melonhead Lol
383,KAMEN RIDER KINRO Gosh I love that build up to this even though it was so cheesy and just all for a pair of glasses.    Also anyone else thought of something worse than piss when they mentioned ammonia?
384,"  KAMEN RIDER KINRO    You mean the legendary hero, Captain Melonhead!"
385,We got Sulph-chan but not Pee-chan? That's discrimination. From this season I learned that pee can even save the life.    It's interesting how a bunch of really dangerous chemicals can be turned into a cure. Science is terrific.
386,I mean... table salt is composed of two very dangerous chemicals
387,So is water.
388,"Take the two apart, get a match and a funnel, and you have a Space Shuttle engine!"
389,"That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about rocket science to argue."
390,"The match and funnel part is an oversimplification, but the Shuttle actually used gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen as fuel. Put the two gasses under pressure, combine and ignite in an enclosed space and you have a rocket nozzle."
391,It used liquid hydrogen. Gasses take up wayyyy to much space to be used in that form.
392,"Thinking about it, there's actually a consistent logic behind it. Basically, dangerous chemicals are usually chemicals that are in a 'less stable' state. What makes them dangerous is that they react aggressively with a bunch of different stuff, including our own bodies, oxidizing, reducing, breaking molecules up, forming radicals, and so on so forth. Oxygen, hydrogen, sodium, chlorine, are all very reactive in their elemental form. But spontaneous processes go in the direction of minimising free energy. Combine those elements and they form stabler, more ""peaceful"" molecules which aren't nearly as dangerous. So in a way it's actually pretty logical that precursors tend to be dangerous stuff, whereas final products are usually tame."
393,"Apropos dangerous chemicals salt is composed of, during electrolysis of table salt which they performed in this very episode with no gas masks chlorine gas, which was used in WW1 as a chemical weapon, is released. In the real world, their lungs would've been dissolved from this."
394,they did have gas masks
395,"That's not electrolysis of sodium chloride, thats preparation of hydrochloric acid      Edit:   this is electrolysis of sodium chloride"
396,Bruh did you even watch the episode they were wearing gas masks.
397,"No they weren't, not during electrolysis of sodium chloride"
398,I am wondering if you can also do the opposite. Take two chemicals that are perfectly edible and combine them without concentrating them into something that kills you.
399,Coke and Mentos?
400,"Disulfiram Antabus and Alcohol    though I guess alcohol's not ""perfectly edible"" either."
401,"I mean everything in this world is made out of the same elements. We are basically water, coal and some metals stitched up in strange ways together. The same iron that is in steel is in our blood. Many compounds in the world are in some way dangerous or toxic towards organic life but are important building blocks for synthesis of completely normal everyday products. It's all in the reactions and doses that you use to create what you need. You can think of them as Lego pieces. You can make a house with them or you can make a ship."
402,"   It's all in the reactions and doses that you use to create what you need.    Yup, drink 8 liters of water in one go and you die, drink too little water and you die. Eat half a kilo of salt in one go and you die, eat no salt and you die.    The chemical reactions in your body needs a careful balance to work, so too little of something or too much of something can both be equally dangerous."
403,I have read that Florine compounds often are some of the safest chemicals we have because Florine's binding strength that makes it insanely dangerous as a gas is the strongest so nothing else is likely to tear stuff away from it or attach to something it's claimed. Chlorine of the same family not quite as dangerous the same with very safe compounds the norm. Chlorine as it does not bind quite as well as Florine but is one of the strongest
404,Chan-Chan!
405,We are NOT bringing Chan-Chan into this!
406,They kinda skipped on converting uric acid to ammonia tho
407,"Magma:  almost beats the shit out of Kinro     Kinro: Huh, I guess this is how it all ends     Sudden piano sounds     Suika: Yes, Kinro. Time for a seven page beatdown."
408,I really want to see someone edit the audio from the muda scene over the top of Kinro pumelling him constantly
409,Is this close enough?
410,They already used the same slo-mo sounds as in JoJo.
411,"The person who rate this episode 2 out of 10 can ""Come back in ten billion years if you want to have a brain battle"""
412,"Yeah if you win the bout you'll get alcohol but you may wanna start stomping some grapes just in case.      When did Senku and Ginro get so close? Probably when they saved each other from having an acid bath.      Ruri knows who Senku is. Curious. Makes one wonder just who it was that founded this village and passed down these tales generations ago. And why so many details about the past were omitted.      And the Mok'gora begins.      Suika gets out of those ropes in the only way she knows how, morph balling.       And way to win the bout with science. And... melon rinds."
413,"Fermenting and distilling the grapes still takes weeks.    No point starting today. Better to focus on winning. If you do lose, 1 or 2 days later isn't going to make a significant difference."
414,"Seriously, I wish to act like ""how did ruri knew about Senku"" but I should be the unlucky anime-watcher who was a victim of spoilers...    I really want to say it. I can't take it anymore...    MELON-TAPE MY MOUTH FAST!!!"
415,"Magma is openly discussion murdering Ruri, and nobody but the science team bats an eye.    How lucky that Suika's glasses prescription works for Kinro too."
416,"He's not killing her though, he's just letting her die."
417,"He literally said ""maybe I won't have to murder her after all.""  That means he's planning to murder her if she doesn't die on her own quickly enough."
418,"So, it's been a few episodes and now I have to ask: am I the only one who loves Suika's voice? The only other VA that has this much of an effect is Y. Aoi"
419,Suika=CUTE
420,"Yeah, I also love her voice.  Haven't seen any other shows with Karin Takahashi though."
421,"Her voice and the animation/sound effects for her specifically made me love her even more than I already did as a manga-reader, really enhances scenes with her in it."
422,"It took 3.670 years, but, finally, Kamen Rider franchise is back! Toei would never let it die. Kinrou will be a good protagonist."
423,and they start us with Gaim too. Based Toei!
424,so many mentions of piss and chin chins    this is gonna be mainstream right?
425,"Gotta have ammonia for science, and urea is one of the best sources for it."
426,nothing but home grown ingredients in Senku's kitchen.
427,100% organic ammonia
428,If he didn't have morals he could have weaponised disease and wiped out Tsukasa's tribe and harvested all the blood for iron. xD
429,"Yeah, but that's super inefficient. An average adult male has  4g of iron distributed throughout their entire body. Even assuming you had a way to harvest it, you would get a lot more value by just convincing people to make iron. If they produce more than 4g like a day's worth of harvesting iron sand, you're already coming out ahead."
430,Well you don't just take the Iron you can find a use for every part of the animal.   By the way modern slaughter houses used every little bit of the animal even part the natives had trouble using well. The concept of natives using the whole animal and civilized not is from stuff like the mass Buffalo killing just for fun of the past or other stupid killing leave the rest to rot of poachers and other hunters only going for a huge dollar item like shark fins when processing the rest would be difficult and not that profitable.    edit to add. Just don't use for animal feed or eat it your self that's how you get the human version of mad cow disease. Who was the moron who decided to put cow in cow feed.
431,Yeah you definitely want to deploy bioweapons before you've even developed antibiotics. That's not gonna backfire at all.
432,Fair point - chemical warfare would be safer.
433,What's a decent way to extract it though?
434,Haber Process.
435,That's for combination of hydrogen and nitrogen or whatever though
436,optimum way to obtain it. Sometimes creating is better than extracting.
437,You don't really have an option to create it when you're still basically in iron age making your whole point moot
438,My point was never about whether they can make it or not. My point was to give an example of a way to produce ammonia.
439,"If filthy frank could, why not dr stone?"
440,Sadly Frank's doing shitty music now
441,You take that back!
442,"Thats now, but at his peak i would have called him „mainstream“ in meme culture."
443,Don't forget they thought of using CBT.
444,Reminds me Chika and Kaguya
445,"Just like that one Fairy Oddparents episode; ""I can see! I CAN FIGHT!"""
446,"  Kohaku is cute af  7      The episode felt short today, it was an amazing episode! The many different faces of disappointments were top notch. Some new and cute Kohaku screenshots were added to the collection. Although, I have to admit I had a hard time resisting adding Suika into the collage. My favorite screenshot is the gleaming smile Kohaku, what about you?"
447,animation a bit wonky in places but extremely fun episode
448,"Yeah the animation was never the best but the art makes up for it, some really good backgrounds too"
449,"Kind of reminds me of JoJo outside of the important moments, hopefully they'll also be redrawn/fixed in the blurays"
450,Yes. Some scenes the characters kinda off model. I hope they fix it in the blurays
451,I highly recommend that if good animation is your key love and need to enjoy anime you stick to the finished product the Blue-Ray. Thus you do lose the chance to comment but you gain the maximum enjoyment of a work.     Just don't expect some things that look better in Black and White still images to look as good in moving color. There a reason some Art films still made in Black and White.
452,in the Real World Time and Deadlines are like Dragons roaring the Sky. So have mercy and wait for the blurays
453,"still a shame that it's wonky, I'm not blaming the poor animators"
454,"Yeah the animations never been great here, but in a series like this where fighting outside of this arc is sparse, its forgivable."
455,No one gets hit in the face just like Gaston
456,"This episode was just incredible. It covered so much and didn’t dilly dally either. I was fully expecting the lingo and magma fight to take place next week, but these mad lads put it in this weeks episode.    P.s. this episode was just down right hilarious and kin to going Ultra Instinct with spikes glasses was incredible.  This show just keeps on giving. I love it so much."
457,Suika deserves all the head pats
458,It's going to be interesting to see how Senku's last name is going to be relevant and why Ruri knows about it. Also the glasses scene was so ridiculous and COOL. I have a feeling that the winner of the Bout is not going to be anyone from team science just to spite us.
459,"Would you look at that. The first Heisei rider was Kuuga who used ancient relics. And this new rider is a Science based rider in a primitive world. And his name is...Kamen Rider...Kinro!    And for those who saw Gaim, we can say that he used...Suika Arms."
460,"Of all things this episode did right, It made me realize how much I love the video game like sound effects for suika. Such a smart decision."
461,I can't believe they aired such brutal during the daytime!
462,Ez protag powerup to beat miniboss
463,They did the fucking sprinkle meme. This series is out of control.    Senku stop scaring Suika!    Ginro and Senku's brofist though.    It's been half a year and Senku is only just now entering the village. Time is flying.    Magma is literally not even hiding the fact that he wants Ruri dead.    Hahaha Suika praying for the right matchups.    Kinro looks stupid af wearing Suika's helmet but it helped him wreck Magma!
464,He hit em with the Mikiri Counter
465,"You really have to have an eye sickness to appreciate how it feels like putting on glasses for the first time. I only got 2 months ago and i only really use them when driving at night and playing video games. The first time i tried them out while playing a video game i was like ""holy shit destiny 2 doesn't actually have bloom and depth of field"" . I played destiny 1 with i think healthy normal eyes that could see things clearly so when i moved to destiny 2 i thought they did a graphical upgrade and added bloom so thats why everything looks ""fuzzy"" . And yes , what you just saw kinro do is exactly how it feels like playing video games with glasses when you didn't know you needed them for so long . I leggit thought i was getting rusty and losing my edge but then i putted on glasses and yup back to slaying and hitting my shots"
466,Someones bout to get f!@ked up
467,Kinro proving why he's best guy     faito
468,Called it last two weeks ago but damn never expected Kinro to have his eyes corrected in a damn cool way.     PS. Having the same eyeglass prescription will not always happen but for simplicity and story's sake we can just assume that Kinro and Suika's nearsightedness are almost/or the same.
469,Their prescriptions don't even need to be that close in order to have a massive impact on eyesight.
470,"I just recently got prescription swim gogglesthey are cheap! with a basic magnification somewhere between my two eye's levellike a 4 when my right is a 4.5 and left is 3.5 and it doesnt account for astigmatism at all, but its a massive upgrade. Enough to where i would be nearly useless back then without glasses, but finding a pair of 5 dollar magnified swim goggles would save my life."
471,Yes they don't have to be.
473," I thought they’d hinted at one being nearsighted and the other farsighted    You are miss remembering. They are both clearly nearsighted. If they were farsighted they wouldn't have too much trouble seeing normally until they went to try and look at something upclose, like writing."
474,I remember whenever I lost my glasses that using somebody else's that was kinda similar was way better than nothing at all at least for stuff like driving so I'll give it a pass.
475,"Know your shounen protagonists.    Goku: I don't care if this is a fight to the death, the fate of the world is at stake, and my son is the opponent, imma give Cell a senzu bean because it should be a fair fight!    Senku: I LIE I CHEAT I STEAL"
476,Viva la rasa
477,Viva la ciencia
478,"Kinro was awesome, that pose when he finaly got the melon mask was dope.    We also got quite a mistery with Ruri knowing about surnames and maybe knowing about who Senku is."
479,Does anyone else get goosebumps when the villagers are amazed by what science can do?
480,This episode is great because wearing glasses in a low technology society is basically unlocking Ultra Instinct
481,"Speculation    While the outcome was pretty cool, Kinro winning doesn't seem like a possibility. Either Magma comes back to win with his finalist armor, or the ref calls cheating for throwing that melon into the fight. Otherwise this gets rather unpredictable. I honestly don't know who could play the major antagonist role, maybe a hidden op dude among the mugs we saw at brackets?"
482,also speculation but I bet Senku entering .... sparks something. Kinro I doubt wins .... either someone else or Chrome/Senku get a fluke win
483,"I think Magma is going to go through because Suika “intervened”. I bet Senku is going to win it because Shonen, but I hope he builds a flamethrower or something"
484,I'm glad they nailed the reaction of seeing Magma and Ginro being the first to fight. Boichis reaction drawings are the best
485,They added Kaseki too
486,10/10 MUSIC
487,It fills up the discrepancy in animation quality
488,Is it weird of me that I skip the OP of this anime not because its bad. Or because I think its bad. But because I'm so hyped to know what's gonna happen that I am too impatient for the OP to play?
489,"Nah, I do the same"
490,"Senku was enjoying himself a bit too much when he was terrifying Suika with those compounds, and that Ammonia bit was amusing as well.    But the best part to me so far I'm still partway through the episode was the groups reaction to seeing Kinro and Magma fighting first thing even if it was kind of obvious that it would happen, Murphy's Law and all."
491,Ammonia Geto was hilarious..
492,Kinro looks sweet
493,"So cheesy and over the top, I loved this episode. Idk man, I always feel in a good mood after an episode of this show."
494,This is the same feel with every new manga chapter. It's just such a FUN series.
495,"I think it is because it generally lacks the intense adverserial qualities some shows have. I mean, there are tense moments, but it is not the type of show that hinges on it. One of my favorite episodes was when they make the noodle cart, for example."
496,"If you are anime only, you'll fucking LOVE what will come later, that I guarantee."
497,I am anime only so far. I look forward to it!

500,Holy shit I was really hoping they would do that but didn't actually think they would
501,Bruh I love how much of cunt senku is fucking hell lmao
502,I really love when character go from lawful neutral to chaotic neutral
503,He was hiding some crossbows poop and chemicals to use on the tournament
504,His ass had everything.
505,"Magma is but a fool, Kinro was using only 10% of his   eyesight   power!    Also Suika is 100% best girl now"
506,"This is what put me down HARD in the Suika camp for best girl. Science was given unto her, giving her the gift of eyesight. In turn, she gifts that same science to another myopic."
507,"I don't know man, Sulfy-chan is just so hot."
508,But can she throw Senzu melons?     girlslastdab
509,I want Sulfy-chan to vore me
510,Loved that Senku-Salt Bae reference!
511,"Lmao wtf were those sound effects when Magma and Kinro were hitting each other, gives OPM S2 sound effects a run for its money"
512,"Soooo, despite the Ginro badassery, he's getting disqualified, right?"
513,Yo Sid Meir is really picking his game up this anime. Upgrading his warrior unit to a spearman in the middle of combat like that.
514,Is this motherfucking TOUUURRRRRNAAAAMEEEENTTT ARRRRRCCCCCC
515,"Pacing was a bit off and there were a few low budget moments, but the hype is real! Love how Kinro became a tokusatsu hero."
516,"I fucking love this show, it's such a fun time."
517,"Never fear, Suika Man is here!"
518,That explosion when Kinro got the glasses was everything that scene needed and deserved.     I think this show will leave me with a lasting impression.
519,I was surprised but should not have been when I researched chronic bacterial disease  that they did exist and afflicted many. We just don't even think of them even existing in this age of antibiotics. And I'm sure they are still their in poor sections of the world we just don't hear in part probably is the faster killers make the news.   So assuming a anti-biotic might work is not foolish at all.
520,that mask powerup was awesome
521,It was very funny  Especially the scene where the fights are decided and it turns out to be opposite of their expectation
522,God. Why do I love hearing Suika's voice every single time she speaks? It's just too cute how she talks.
523,I see you   Kamijou Touma
524,Super Sentai Suikaman Ranger!!!
525,The over the top explosion was 11/10
526,Just finished the episode.     My Theory so far as anime only:    Since Ruri asked for Senku’s last name and had heard his first name before as well as no one else having last names I’m assuming someone from his family/friend had thawed out many years before him and she has a message for him or some sort of rare material for him to continue his quest into rebuilding humanity. I know it would be a very big coincident that he just happens to stumble across a village that has something for him but anime likes to be ridiculous at times 😂
527,I bet it was his dad.
528,That’s the best bet if it’s what is actually going to happen considering he’s been supportive of Senku but since we know next to nothing about Senku’s personal life beforehand I left it open since it could be an easy way to introduce a new character that has shaped him as a person.
529,Ya.
530,Kinro is Gold Experience. The melon is the Requiem Arrow.
531,   GINRO FOR THE WIN!!!      I was cheering him on so much! I seriously wanted that bastard Magma defeated!! And seeing Ginro put on Suika's glasses and seeing clearly was so awesome!
532, Kinro  Nobody wants Giro to win.
533,magma VS ginro in a nutshell
534,"So did Ginro and Suika just happen to have the exact prescription? I thought eye sight varied in individuals, even in a small gene pool like the village."
535,"Even if it's not exact, even just being in the same ballpark would dramatically improve his eyesight.     My prescription has changed a lot over the years, but even wearing my pair from like 10 years ago would be better than not having glasses at all."
536,"Especially when both of them are near sighted, not one far one near and suika's is not on the extremes, it will usually be an improvement. He sure won't pass the eye examination with that still."
537,"When you see his improved eyesight, it still not complete clear, but still better than without it. If"
538,it's explained later
539,Hey is this episode lagging like hell for anyone else with the subtitles breaking and pausing?
540,"Oh hell yeah, that was a good episode.    I hope Chrome somehow wins the whole thing. I really wnated to watch Senkuu and Kohaku fight, so hopefully she gets back in time.     YO RURI KNOWS SENKUU'S LAST NAME!?!? I need to find out answers! Can't wait for next week."
541,Wow this episode is so epic and hilarious at the same time !    - the part where Senku and Chrome making ammonia through pissing is so funny 😂    - Senkus evil expressions is so hilarious. But don't scare our adorable Suika    - I love how their plans and schemings went to waste when Kinro and magma was paired on the very first battle haha    - maybe it's just me but Kinro wearing Suika s mask actually made him a bit cool LOL    Looking forward to the next episode :
542,"Suika:  KINROU, GATTAI DA!!!     I wonder if that's a violation of the rules and Magma is going to win regardless.    also lol at the things Senku was making that Ruri was going to drink xD"
543,"I was half expecting the degrees of Suika's glasses to be completely off for Kinro, him getting a massive headache and for him to lose the match because of that."
544,"i was waiting for him to get glasses, although i though senku wouldve been the one to notice rather than suika"
545,I thought Ginro would’ve told him a few days before the tournament and Senku had a pair of glasses/lenses ready
546,{Dr. Stone}
547,So antibiotics contain pee.. didn't know that 😂
548,"Sulfra drug version does, Idk about the biological type."
549,It contains mushroom waste or pee if you choose to see it that way
550,"If you put it that way, before the opening of Soyuz,  Senku is depetrifying everyone with bat poop XD"
551,Does someone have the name of the song used in the last part of the fight ?
552,"We did not think that Kinrou would be the mask warrior but man seeing him beat up on Magma at the end was so satisfying. Lots of great reaction faces this episode, especially from Kohaku."
553,"   YEAH, SCIENCE BITCH!   "
554,My bet is kinro wins the fight against magma then goes against his values and let's chrome take the win so he can be with ruri.
555,Didn’t Senku make alcohol the first episode?
556,Well ya but remember that scene where he starts making alcohol and it's fall... Then he's sitting in the snow watching it drip... And Then the snows gone and hes still watching it drip.    The point is distillation and fermentation takes lots of time... And Ruri's got like   looks at watch   about a quarter passed last week. Fastest way to get liquor is to for him is definitely to get some that's already made.
557,"Totally forgot about that, thanks"
558,I think he just wants to be spared the effort of making it since he can get it for free after the bout.
559,No it just take a while to make
560,Suika best girl
561,I just ordered the first 5 volumes of the manga because of this episode
562,Good job! Supporting the author and artist!
563,I would get more if my paycheck was bigger rip
564,Am I the only one who is rooting for Kohaku to win the whole thing? Her actually marrying Ruri would be hilarious.
565,She won the last one. Isn’t this one supposed to be a do-over because of it?
566,1 small problem.    C H R O M O
567,"that was a super fun episode! art was inconsistent, but didn't matter still hype. kinro believing in his friends and science was great."
568,Holy shit the King Crimson sound effects when Kinro was dodging all those attacks was amazing hahaha
569,I feel like Kinro may be disqualified due to outside help in-between the match and Magma being allowed to continue if he is able to.
570,"I can see what Gigguk was getting at.    Also, someone pointed out on my Twitter feed that Mantle looks like a certain streamer who has the charisma of a pig and the resilience of a cockroach...    With Magma out of the way, there really isn't much to worry about since there don't seem to be that many other combatants that could even put up a fight against the warriors of science. Kohaku being MIA seems to be a non-issue if the rest of the tournament is rigged, and hopefully we can get some backstory on how Ruri knows who Senku is sooner rather than later."
571,"I have a sinking feeling that the melon toss from Suika is going to count as outside interference, and thus disqualify Kinro, and the rest of the tournament will suddenly ramp up trying to make up time for Gorilla Girl to get back."
572,Still the most fun anime this season
573,This show is just so fun.
575,"Those are some awfully specific ""predictions""; I'm anime only, so I have no idea if these are right.     I'm keeping my eyes on you. sideeyes"
576,"i'm anime only too so i won't be surprised if they're wrong, but i could explain my reasoning if you're curious. like i paused the episodes and looked at the matchups think chrome is up against that short guy who was lying, so i will be surprised if chrome will lose that one.     some other stuff i'm mainly predicting because it would be the most dramatic. like i will surprised if chrome doesn't end up with ruri somehow because the series super sold that pairing to us, complete with childhood flashbacks and chrome being selflessly motivated for ruri's well being, so narratively if she ends up with senku or kinro it would be really weird. therefore he beats magma ""somehow,"" even though i don't know how."
577,I'm anime +manga and I can only laugh
578,Anime only as well    Inb4 Ruri was in Senku's class and always had a crush on him but he never paid attention to her because he was too busy with science.    Though she said she has never met him but have heard of him?     Hmm
579,"we know she was taught stories that related to the welfare of the village and were passed down for multiple generations, so i think it's implying apparently i'm required to spoiler tag speculation now""that someone who de-petrified and founded the village knew senku and thought highly of him. it doesn't seem like he had a lot of friends besides the ones we saw so maybe it was his dad.""."
580,"Actually very possible, maybe ""Ruri was de-petrified? But then again you gotta think about her age and how she knew of Senku before. Seems like there are old people there so she's definitely not a de-petrified"""
581,Dude dont post spoilers and lie saying your anime only

583,That jojo pose tho...
584," MELON LORD POWERRRRRRRRRRRR!       doggo      Still got a little bit to go!  Its Montage time!      OH NO ITS PEE!  SHES GONNA DRINK PEE!      So they can get the alchol they need from the tourny?      Of course Jane would compete!  And Senku too! hahahahha      Of course they are rigging the contest hahaha.      Its time to get Kinro some glasses!      So Senku has been living outside the village for 6 months?  Not bad.      WHY DOES THE SIS KNOW HIS NAME!?  WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?      WHY DOES SHE KNOW SENKU's FUL NAME!?  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!      Oh damn the Monkey is competeing too?  Going for the wee wee? hahahahahahahah      Uh oh... Kinro first... the rig didnt work... MAKE HIM GLASSES!      DONT TOUCH MMELON LORD YOU HOBBIT GOON!  FUCK OFF!      This white hiar ref guy has the sae eyes as Kinro, is he his father?      Lick your shoes?  Fuck off.

GO TEAM SCIENCE!      Also that disclaimer at the end hahaha.  Gotta be safe with todays ep topics."
585,I am surpise they didn't use the caption: Good boy and girl don't go around melting  corpse.
586,So Kinro is a jojo character when he puts on the mask. Nice.
587,Nobody cared who I was until I put on this mask
588,Ginro is the contender of the best boy
589,"After OP2 i can´t hear the hit sound effects without thinking if it is from some random gun shoot sound, lol."
590,Machine gun punch
591,MACHINEGUN BLOW 
592,love the salt bae reference
593,Well isn’t Mantle the most horrid man I’ve ever seen!
594,THE POWER OF POSE!!
595,Anyone else thought of the jackass guy from Happy Gilmore whenever the henchman was on screen? lol
596,"Hopefully, he won't lose to some bullshit reason for the plot. This dude is domination please don't let midget ruin it."
597,DID SOMEONE SAY TOURNAMENT ARC?
598,spinning watermelon head was great as always
599,When the new OP? Is it on episode 15 like Fire Force?
600,Loved this episode. Does anybody know how many episodes are going to be in season 1?
601,24
602,Thank you!
603,My pleasure
604,Senku you cheater  bastard
605,Yo what the hell happened to Chrome's hair during the melon head part?
606,He's totally going to get disqualified
607,"Shounen in a mostly science anime? Yeah,not complaining.    and was Ruri also petrified way back?"
608,No. That village has been there for many generations.
609,is this final episode or will there be 20 something episodes ?
610,24 episodes
611,"""Domo, Kinro-desu.""   explosions  "
612,"Salt bae really is one popular meme in Japan, huh?    Also, odd that Ruri apparently knows Senku."
613,I've never seen such a badass watermelon.
614,The animation is dissapointing me a bit
615,i watched this based on pure curiosity but now i'm actually enjoying it! wow that battle went by extremely fast.
616,"Such a fun episode! I was worried this was the end but it's 24 episodes so yay for that!    I have always been excited about the tournament and getting to see Ruri miraculously healed eventually. Cannot wait for that. Of course the tourny was awesome, with the matchups being the exact opposite of what they wanted the reaction face was the best. However, Senku always knows best and they keep at it. Seeing Kinro finally get his ""glasses"" in the form of the melon head mid-battle was awesome! Definitely the best part. I love how they played it up like he was a superhero. I think it's important not just for comedic effect but to show how glasses have really changed him. Can't wait to see what's in store for us with the rest of the tournament."
617,"Now that I think about it, why does Magma want Ruri dead so quickly? She's pretty cute, and it's not like he wouldn't be in control anyway.    What's the downside of keeping her alive for him?"
618,He would need to take care of her and her illness.
619,He can just relegate to someone else. Chiefs don't have to take care of their wive's illness. That's what the village doctor is for.    She already has people looking after her anyway. He wouldn't have to do a thing.
620,He specifically mentioned he doesn't give two kicks about nursing her in one of the episodes. She is a burden to him.
621,Best episode hands down
622,I am.. THE WATERMELON MAN!
623,Best episode so far.
624,"will the melon glasses be allowed, or would that count as interference??"
625,when he got the glasses
626,That was EPIC
627,"Kinro: ""So this is the power of   ultra instinct   science"""
628,"Imagine that after he puts the helmet on, we find out he has to opposite near/far-sighted condition as Suika, so the helmet makes the situation worse?  Whomp, whomp."
629,This episode is the best. The kid was the the MVP for me
630, Suika    How can a kid be so badass?
631,Who knows the soundtrack that was played when SUika threw her mask?
632,Kinro getting the Eyes of Science was epic!! It kinda reminded me of another show from my childhood day's called Shaolin Showdown that had a similar helmet.
633,The watermellon of clearsight      + 10 accuracy      - 5 coolness     100% chance to lose due to being a stickler to the rules
634,But shouldn't he be disqualified for the interference? Anyways I love Kinro.
635,"finally Kinro is not suborn to get glasses, for no reason to switch his ways automatically besides to beat the bad guy but whatever, at least it was funny and over the top when he got the melon glasses.    they knew the bad guy was lying but sure lets listen to him anyways and go and save the friend even if they could of sent literally anyone else, why didn't they ask the bad guy ""why didn't you get her if she is drowning then?"" its just that it gets me that hes lying and yet they still send the best fighter to go get em. sending senku sounds like the better idea because in the bracket hes fighting the best figher, giving gino and kohaku the advantage to get ahead?    i could be just a stick in the mud but ya that's my gripes of the episode. so 7/10 for me"
636,"Kinrou realized he cannot win the match with his bad eyesight. Combine that with the ""I have people that depend on me"" trope and after taking a near ko hit he had no other actions left. Call it character development or survival instinct.  Kohaku mentioned she is the fastest among them and if Suika really fell into the river she needs help asap.   I don't see the problem here."
637," Kinrou realized he cannot win the match with his bad eyesight. Combine that with the ""I have people that depend on me"" trope and after taking a near ko hit he had no other actions left.    i guess.     Kohaku mentioned she is the fastest among them and if Suika really fell into the river she needs help asap. I don't see the problem here.    well, they knew he was lying, everybody knew it, everybody suspected it, there wasn't a single person that wasn't onto him and for the most part sending a person to check was just a precautionary measure, also, were forgetting that she perfectly can stand up and ""swim"" in the same riverepisode 8, all this is saying that its 10 billion percent likely that not only is he lying but his story makes no sense. there's also the point that if she really was drowning it wouldn't make any sense for him to go back to the village warn only the group of friends about it and continue watching the tournament if he wasn't lying.    if he was a more trusted guy in the villageof course secretly a bad guy it would make more sense because everybody  that lived around there would believe him and senku would be the only one questioning the guy.    how is this not a problem?"
638,"Strange dude who walks around with a guy who's already tried to kill another one of your friends walks up to you and says another one is in mortal peril, and you're not the least bit worried about what became of them?    He only tied up Suika to a tree, in the end, but in this situation he could have done any number of things to ensure that Suika wouldn't come back preemptively, including possibly knocking her out and throwing her in the river to actually give himself some credibility and avoid fallout from his actions. He could excuse himself from not saving her because he's like 20 centimeters tall and probably weights just as much as Suika herself on top of being able to claim not knowing how to swim.    Knowing he was lying doesn't mean you can assume Suika is safe. In fact, it means the opposite."
639,"then why is kohaku still going to the river if that's true, even she said she would check the river. also him unable to save her from drowning doesn't make sense because how did he lift her off the ground to tie her to the tree in the first place he weighs more and is arguably taller, nether of them don't make any sense because one  is wasting time by telling the friend's that one of them is in ""mortal pearl""which shes not and the other is making a mistake to go to the river even though they know hes lying and that shes not drowning.    and besides i'm arguing that they should of not sent the best fighter, not that they shouldn't go and check at all.    side note: also, the villagers are jerks, they won't go out and help look for Suika even though she is one of their own, none of these people make any sense at allat least morally."
640,"Because the river is their only lead. She could look somewhere else if she doesn't find her drowning, but there's no reason to risk not going for the obvious choice when the ""knocked out -  thrown in water"" scenario is a possibility. Him not being able to save her doesn't have to make sense, it just needs to be a somewhat plausible excuse that the other villagersnot the smartest people and liable to disagree with Senku and Chrome out of sheer antagonism will buy...  but  that's only necessary if we're assuming that they even care about him killing Suika or not, since the only ones who'd accuse him would be the outsiders and the pariahs.     Kohaku's is the fastest and the fittest, meaning that she has 1 the shortest ETA to getting to Suika, and 2 the highest chances of saving her if she's in danger and not yet dead. There are many different plans Senku could have concocted to prevent Ruri's death at Magma's hands should he win the tournament, and it's not guaranteed that Kohaku won't be able to return before her match anyways. Magma already expects Ruri to croak soon so it's unlikely he'll risk earning the ire of the village by killing their esteemed priestess with his own hands, which means the issue is no more pressing than the time limit imposed by Ruri's disease. As for the alcohol, there are other ways to get it, including making it with Senku team's own resources, buttering up the villagers, or flat out stealing it.     When weighting Suika's immediate possible danger against Ruri's concrete but expectantly distant danger, the mere non-zero chance that they'll lose Suika due to a perfectly avoidable lapse in judgement simply because they were insecure in their ability to beat Magma makes sending Kohaku the logical choice, especially when Suika has shown to be a valuable asset to the team time and time again, and would surely be an integral part of any subsequent plan to protect Ruri and obtain alcohol, should Magma triumph in the tournament."
641,"the ""knocked out -  thrown in water"" senerio doesn't work because that still drowning and we already established he lied about it, they know hes untrustworthy because he witnessed magma try to kill their own but mentioned nothing of it.    also, senku is the guy that said he wants to save anyone in any senerio its not that unlogical that he would go himself and plus we saw him outrun a lion, the only reason he stopped running is they found shishio, id say hes fast and fit and still has an extremely high chance of saving herif she was in danger in the first place, has science on his side with cpr which makes himself even more capable saving her, and not only that but him leaving gives everybody in his group more likely to beat magma because:    1 they're having the best fighter stay behind 2 the best fighter gets a pass to the next round and 3 it would be a great character point for him because that shows he really cares and is not just there to bribe them into his scientific utopia.    also, they're both in immediate danger, we don't know when either of them will die or if they even will during the episodes to come    furthermore, there's no point in killing suika, the whole point was to make the strongest leave the tournament, nothing more. we don't actually know if he would kill anybody himself, as a matter of fact, he seems more like the guy who would let magma do all the dirty work and then throw him under the bus whenever he is into question, he doesn't even seem like a henchmen or slave either hes more like ""the guy that follows the bully around because hes cool"" or whatever. at least that's how i see him."
642,"It's not that he was ""too proud for glasses"" before, he'd just missed the part about ""glasses are a thing that exist and work,"" and nobody bothered to tell him. He was too proud to  admit  to being semi-blind, but only because he thought that was a crippling debility. If he'd known it was curable, he would have been all for it."
643,"he was still pretty stubborn to the fact that he didn't ask, he even told his brother not to tell, he didnt even think  that science might be able to cure him. also don't you think he would of overheard them talk about it, when kohaku went over to take the mask from senku?    as a matter of fact nobody noticed until this episode which makes you wonder why didn't anybody notice until now? don't you think somebody would notice that he was making the same mistake over and over and that hes not at fault? don't you think kohaku and/or suika would notice it before then? now, kohaku knows that there is a cure but your expecting me to believe that not a single person put 2 and 2 together? i seriously doubt it."
644,"  he was still pretty stubborn to the fact that he didn't ask, he even told his brother not to tell, he didnt even think that science might be able to cure him.    Nobody would, without reason to think so.     also don't you think he would of overheard them talk about it, when kohaku went over to take the mask from senku?    No, he did not.     as a matter of fact nobody noticed until this episode which makes you wonder why didn't anybody notice until now?     Because he was stubbornly good at hiding for it. He didn't want anyone to figure it out. There are kids who go years in schooling, unable to read, and without letting on that they are unable to read. If you're trying to hide a problem that embarrasses you, it can be quite achievable."
645,i guess so.
646,Did everybody see the Salt-bae?
647,The power of WATERMELON and science
648,What was the song that plays when Kinrou gets Melon hat?
649,My bet's on Ruri getting her knowledge from Senku's Dad that's been passed down for generations. Manga readers no spoilerinos
650,"I literally posted something very similar to this just a second ago, so I’m not the only one that thinks this or on these lines"
651,I'd like to think it's obvious but like this theory would require a lot of coincidences to work. Obviously this is a story so that possibility is still there.    Guess I'll find out hopefully next week because otherwise I dont think I can hold off from reading the mango any longer lol
652,"Man Kinro's posing was cringey. Also a bit miffed Suika didn't run into Kohaku on her way back. Also I feel like there should've been a trial over Mantle tying up Suika, or should be when this round is concluded."
653,"Kinro's posing was supposed to be ridiculous, didn't you see the huge explosion and reaction faces?"
654,"No, I saw. It was just remarkably cheesy, deliberately or not."
655,Kamen Rider reference of course it's cheesy 😂
656,"deliberately cheesy isn't cringy imo, but to each their own"
657,"Ginro used ""glasses"" that were prepared specifically for Suika and he can see clearly through them?     bruh    If anything his vision would be worse. Even if they were off by .25 point that would be enough for his vision to get blurry."
658,"the manga""addresses this. Ginro goes from `fucked at 10 feet` to `working depth perception` with Suika`s mask. He gets real correction at a later date."""
659,"  Ginro used ""glasses"" that were prepared specifically for Suika and he can see clearly through them?                i know it's anecdotal, but i am nearsighted and have worn another nearsighted person's glasses and they improved my vision, allowing me to read sheet music at something of a distance. as long as the glasses are roughly the same as mine it's still an improvement over my unaided eyes- and ginro's vision is worse than mine so like another user pointed out it would be easier for him to get an improvement.    the unbelievable part is that the glasses they made with their available technology work in the first place."
660,"Yup, it may not be perfect when I put someone elses glasses on but it is a hell of alot better than nothing."
661,? all you need is glass blowing and knowing how lenses work. Invented 1284 with a Reading stone at 1000. They did greatly shorten the amount of time and casting of lenses that would have to have been done to find the right ones but they have been there six months. Should have been try these and it's better but not that close and then steady improvements over time as they get closer and closer to the right curve of glass. And it will be a very labor intensive fix for each person till the vision detection devices and ability to cast identical each time developed.
662,i mean stuff like how they poured molten glass through bamboo or how the lenses are apparently held in place by melon that's over six months old. i don't know much about glassmaking but i don't think it works that way.
663,"I myself am nearsighted and I had quite a lot nearsighted colleagues and none of the glasses worked for the other person. Plus more often than not the defect in both eyes vary, so if he got one good glass and other bad his 3D vision would be greatly affected and he wouldn't be able to dodge like that."
664,"even if it's like a 1/1000 chance to use a random number of the lenses helping him i don't think it's that unbelievable. less likely things happen irl every day.      Plus more often than not the defect in both eyes vary, so if he got one good glass and other bad his 3D vision would be greatly affected and he wouldn't be able to dodge like that.    next you are going to tell me it's not possible for someone to defeat a lion in a single punch. /s    i wouldn't be surprised if ginro is even stronger when he has custom made glasses that are specific to his eyesight, but the narrative point is that ginro is one of these super powered humans like tsukasa and magma and this is the equivalent of his weighted bracers coming off or at least the weight decreasing.    i do agree that this wouldn't happen irl for all sorts of reasons, but the show has been pretty consistent about many of its characters having superhuman abilities."
665,"He had plenty of time to get a pair of glasses suited to him but he chose to withhold the information. All for this ""plot twist"". It just looks dumb to me, especially in the series that promotes science."
666,"he's a stone age warrior with a strong sense of honor who initially feels he should be able to fight under his own unaided strength and who doesn't want to shame himself by admitting to having a weakness like the ""fuzzy eyesight sickness"".     that's the point of the scene where he is giving them a hard time for rigging and kohaku says ""well, if it's to save my sister's life..."" it gets him to start questioning some of his assumptions. once he's actively losing the fight he realizes his perspective is holding him back and he needs to become more open to utilizing technological solutions for his own problems and that this doesn't have to negate his sense of honor.    sure the twist was predictable, but seems pretty in line with the story's themes to me."
667,"His vision was already terrible. Like, cannot judge how far away a human figure standing about five to ten feet away is bad.    Any sort of corrective lenses have a great then fifty percent chances of providing at least some improvement.    I mean, worst case, what was he going to do, lose harder?"
668,"And best case scenario he's going to effortlessly dodge all those strikes? If one lens was stronger, then his depth vision would get screwed. Never have I tried someone else's glasses and improved my vision even for a bit. If anything it got more blurry than being without glasses."
669,You never tried anyone else glasses that were anywhere close to yours then quite possible. I have tried others glasses that were way better than nothing although I would not be able to clearly read at a distance. And both eyes being roughly the same off if I recall right is way more common than big differences. This same off would be from it's the same genetic flaw causing the sight problem in both eyes.
670,Last time I ordered glasses they screwed one lens by only .25 and it was so blurry I had better vision without glasses at all.
671,his eyes might be even worse than Suika's
672,That's only a little more optimistic scenario and that's when both of their eyes have the same defect which is almost never the case. And with wrong glasses on each eye his 3D perception would be ruined. At least he wouldn't be able to dodge anything.
673,huh? Is it really that unlikely? I've worn my friends glasses lots of times and many times they're only slightly less probably because my eyes are worse.
674,"Very. I once ordered a pair of glasses and they screwed the lens by exactly 0.25 and it got more blurry than without glasses.     I got lots of colleagues who also wore glasses and never has there been a pair that fitted the other person when we tried each other glasses on.    I know it's anime and all, but he had plenty of time to get his own pair but he elected to withhold the information. And now it just looks dumb to me."
675,"your judging only on your eye sight and what your exact problem is. And this is nearsighted almost any lens for nearsightedness improves my vision, somewhere close would be good enough for my depth perception to work and for me to react to a blured fist. I have used prescription pair from 30 years ago that is quite off my current to find my normal pair when I could not find my main. Long story on why I could find the really old but not have anything more current near.   Now for reading yes anything not very close will not work."
676,well now I'm wondering what the author and editors were thinking missing such a detail.
677,It's a shounen series so nobody batted an eye.
678,"Anime Magic....    Overlook it for the Story flow, action and fun. In the end it is all fiction not a real life documentation"
679,"For a series that puts science above all, this is bullshit. He had more than enough time to ask for a pair of glasses but he elected not to."
680,"I mean, it's really mostly for dramatic effect.  Is it most likely that the glasses wouldn't have worked for him, at least not well?  Probably.  It's also still possible they needed nearly exactly the same correction.  It's pretty unlikely sure, but it's still possible and I can believe that they just got super lucky for the sake of the story."
681,You don't need it that close to fight or navigate and even drive. Now if you have a good amount of Astigmatism it gets harder to find close.     They do have research for this show. I would stick to the stuff that clearly is untrue in this story the author does seam to put impossible in. Throwing the helmet just right and it rotating just right to jump into it very unlikely. How that girl in the Melon moves is impossible in reality. Lots of stuff clearly way off it seams the author like to show the impossible and unlikely by making it very clear they are so.
682,Don't make it so personal this is far from the most egregious unscientific thing in the anime just sit back and enjoy or just drop it if its too much.
685,"In an anime where highschoolers bare knuckle explode lions, why am I so upset that a near sighted person and a far sighted person were able to wear the same glasses?"
686,They were both nearsighted
687,"Oh fair, i guess to just different degrees?"
688,"Yeah, but speaking from experience during an eye test, a pair of glasses doesn't need to be perfect to help ones eyesight.     When I got my first pair of glasses, the first lens they put on me was just the basic nearsighted lens and everything was so much clearer, the amazing moment which Suika had is very accurate"
689,"Yea no, my bad. I am near sighted in one eye, and far sided in the other: So I really shouldn't be confused by the difference, was just having a brainfart moment."
690,It's okay :3  hug 
691,"I used to be nearsighted and when I tried someone else's glasses, most would still massively improve my eyesight, even if it would still be somewhat blurry depending on the exact prescriptions."
692,But Kinro wasn't able to see Magma from far while Suica sunflower up close.
693,"Senko said ""You're nearsighted as hell"" Meaning she could only see things really close up.  Kinro couldn't see magma far away which means he is also near sighted because he could only see things close up"
694,"Suika couldn't see far away either. The sunflower closeup was just done to properly draw all the detail, to show that Suika could now see all that detail instead of just the basic shape."
695,They're both near sighted but the chance that they both have the same dioptre isn't very high.
696,"On a side note, some knowledgeable person can enlighten us if that's actually the most efficient way of getting antibiotics?    I'm no chemist, but isn't getting moldy breador was it broth easier than all of that process?    I know it wouldn't be as entertaining to watch 3 episodes of mold growing, but still I'd like to know."
697,"This was already mentioned in episode 8. They had 2 choices from the start, either penicilin or sulfa drugs. Because penicilin requires insane luck, they decided to go the surefire sulfa drug route."
698,"I know how they justified that in the show, but penicillium mold really isn't really that rare, so it sounded more like a plot device."
699,"""On March 14, 1942, the first patient was treated for streptococcal sepsis with US-made penicillin produced by Merck & Co. Half of the total supply produced at the time was used on that one patient.""    Obtaining the correct strain of mould with large enough yield is required. This was also mentioned in episode 8."
700,"Not quite. The type of penicillium mold we use today has been specifically cultured, modified and selected for until we had a more pure form that we could mass produce in vast quantities. Not only that, but in the wild it requires high amounts of luck to actually get a small amount of the version of the mold which only has a fraction of the effectiveness that the moulds we use today have.    Put another way. Even when they discovered penicillium, it took them years before they were able to effectively mass produce it. And for a long time it was the case where there were less than 10 vials in the world at any given time, with 9 of them in labs for study and enhancements"
701,Alright that makes sense but in a survival situation wouldn't that still be easier than find a naturally occurring acid lake of which I found there's apparently only one in Java?
702,"Not quite. The acid lake might be hard to find, but finding the correct penicillium mold is basically impossible."
703,Iirc penicilin mold was found by sheer luck in a rotten melon in a street market.
704,"The long story is, the ""moldy bread"" that is fairly easy to acquire is very weak, like not enough to actually do anything, like putting a few grains of sugar into a gallon of water and expecting it to taste like Kool-aid. They spent a lot of time and effort concentrating that stuff just to make enough for one person to get any benefit. At some point they got lucky with some more aggressive variants that are easier to concentrate, but that could not be counted on."
705,Love the JoJo pose when Kinro gets the glasses let's just ignore the fact that a helmet for small child fits perfectly on a grown man
706,Well to be fair said melon can also fit Suika's body so I don't think it's that absurd
