1,"All this episode reminded me is how much I miss Chrome in the new manga arc. Seriously, he's the best."
2,I like how they adapted the scene where Senku explains everything to Chrome. It's more impactful and it allows the audience to get Chrome's emotions a lot better than in written form.
3,"I very much enjoy this scene in manga and again in anime.    Really make you appreciate how far the we've come, and how much we took for granted."
4,"An important foreshadowing on this episode for manga readers:    Latest manga chapter spoilers ""Ishigami village got their ""outsiders are evil people, just like stone statues"" from the island of origin, where the bad people are turned to stone by the chief people and dropped on the sea outside the island."""
5,I wonder what the genesis of that is.
6,"I don't think so. My theory is that they genuinely don't believe there are any people in the world other than the villagers, and if there is anyone out there it  must  be someone who was exiled long ago, so they can't be good people. manga spoiler""I don't think they are actually aware of the other island even though they have Soyuz in their ranks who we actually saw in today's episode!"""
7,"Here's a full list of the villagers and their names that the anime has left out, 40 people in total    First  Second     Also this amazing page of a proud Senku"

11,"  Here's a full list of the villagers and their names that the anime has left out    I hope anime is simply shuffling the reveal order, perhaps spoiler""after senku becomes the village head"""
12,"They said excluding the old people and the kids, so Senku's monkeysphere calculation recently wasn't exactly right it seems."
13,I can't wait to see my dear Suika next episode! uwu
14,I can't wait for my dear Suika to see.
15,"Yes! And to see my dear Suika's face. I've seriously been estimating which episode she'll be introduced in and counting down since the first episode.  That moment when she got glasses was so relatable for me, cuz I also have the fuzzy eye disease, not as bad as her, something like 5/20 vision now, but I didn't realize until I tried on someone else's glasses and I was amazed by how much of the world I wasn't able to see before."
16,Am I tripping or did they forgot the ''calculation battle'' between Chrome and Senku ?
17,They skipped it    Edit: nevermind that was it. They'll explain it later iirc
18,What ? I laugh my ass of reading it like BRUH...
19,"I hope they add it in later as an aside, just like they did in the manga."
20,It was in the episode around the 15 minute mark
21,It's expanded in chapter 18.    Edith actually I misremembered it. It's the same.
22,"  Edith actually I misremembered it. It's the same.    You didn't misremember. The details of arithmetic battle was inserted later as bonus pages.      EDIT:   End of chapter 22, here you go"
23,Ah I see. Too bad they didn't include it. Maybe later in a special.
24,Are you referring to this at the end of chapter 18 as there is nothing beyond that
25,My bad. Although I could swear Senku explained how he beat him at some point later. Some arrithmetrick was employed.
26,"Manga""who's hungry for ramen?"""
27,"I don't but I would really want a ""coke"" right about now."
28,"It's all about the Manga""cotton candy"", my dude."
29,"tagging just in case""i like that they are adding little details like kohaku knowing some english words, idk if other villagers will speak it too. update: yeah kinrou and chrome did speak some english words too.. nice."""
30,Not reading your comment because I'm not up to date but your spoiler tag isn't working.
31,"thanks, had to switch to old reddit just to have it work..  ,<"
32,"Yup! it was a neat little thing, but really hammered the point."
33,What chapter is this on the manga? I want to start reading
34,Either 18 or 19
35,Next week Suika...with Gen as cliffhanger
36,Can someone spoiler the antibiotic he makes? Only the name. No details or if he considers a different one first but fails.
37,"it's in chapter 20. And the name is spoiler""'sulfur drug from rocks'"""

47,"I loved the first 6 episodes but I'm already loving this arc twice as much.       Chrome's personality and character design makes him seem like he's the MC in a regular anime, while Senku is like the rival he's constantly trying to catch up with. It feels fresh to have them be on the same side"
48,"  I loved the first 6 episodes but I'm already loving this arc twice as much.    Exactly this. It became much more interesting as soon as Senku met the other tribe.    Before it was:     ""Senku and the gang from the modern age try to revive the world while a 10th generation Joestar tries to hunt them down""    And now its:    ""Senku uses his knowledge and power to move primitive people who never knew how amazing the world was from stone age back to the modern age. While the Joestar is nowhere to be seen."""
49,"  10th generation Joestar tries to hunt them down    Oh boi, did Araki really manage to get to part 10 in the last 3,700 years? This is amazing."
50,The 3.7k years were just a really long Za Worludo for him
51,Can revival fluid de-petrify Angelo?
52,Yo Angelo!
53,It’s exhilarating!
54,  10th generation Joestar    Am I the only one who thinks he just looks exactly like Kars?
55,“10th generation Joestar” Broke me
56,Dr. Stone is not far from being an Isekai
57,Chrome now knows how we feel about the library of Alexandria
58,And how we felt when the holy library of the unhappy panda that was lost to us in the modern age.
59,that came back tho
60,Wait it's ba-  Ohh shit 
61,Make sure to use https
62,wait it came back? I thought that panda was gone for good?
63,"it came back after like 1 week, some rich guy funded transfer of the servers"
64,"wow, thank you for the heads up."
65,what is this unhappy panda thing?
66,It is better known as SadPanda.    It is the modern day Library of Alexandria and it was almost lost to us a few weeks ago.
67,And how we feel about censorship on the new library we call Internet.
68,"Nah, that we can still manage. But the library is lost forever."
69,Can we have an F?
70,Haven't seen anyone talking about how the villagers sometimes mix english words in their speech and Senku repeats them in japanese to make it more clear.    Its not something that can be easily translated in text like sub or manga.
71,"Yeah, I'm not fluent in Japanese so I'm sure I missed some times, but I realized that was going on when Kohaku said there were ""forty"" people and Senku said ""yonjuunin"" I think. It makes sense though, I'm assuming some of the revived people were foreigners who would speak English or something, especially with the diverse hair colors among the new civilization."
72,"I dont know if we can take the hair colour thing as given, seeing how Senkuu has natural white hair with turquoise tips."
73,"That's true, honestly I didn't even consider that LOL      I guess I'm just really used to anime characters having whatever hair color, but blonde being the ""THIS IS A FOREIGNER!!!"" indicator?  shrug "
74,They omitted that line from Tsukasa upon meeting Kohaku
75,He's the beautiful love child between a man and a leek.
76,Truly a feat of science
77,Didn't senkuu say something about her being a foreigner when he noticed the blue eyes and blonde hair?
78,"Huh, I've read the manga, but even I didn't know about that.    That is a very interesting catch."
79,"I'm more astonished that they talk fluent japanese with this mixed english while we at the moment have not any idea about the moment they came back. Did they even got petrified ? At the actual moment, nobody knows."
80,Oh wow nice catch
81,"Yeah, as a manga reader i noticed that too and when it clicked why it was amazing. You'll learn why this is eventually"
82,"SMUG    Kohaku and Senkuu’s dynamic is really good because of their difference. He’s sneaky and smart and she’s honest and chivalrous, makes it very fun."
83,That is some 10 billion percent smugness.
84,Also ???% derpy Lion mane
85,I want that gorilla to step on me.
86,You want to be gravel?
87,  STONE ROAD
88,RODA ROLLA DA
89,  STONE OCEAN 
90, Gravel of culture 
91,"3700 years into the future, humans have acquired a mutation that they no longer have armpit hair."
92,"I'm glad, armpit hair looks weird, whether on chicks  or  dudes.    The dudes are also completely hairless on the legs."
93,They could just shave with a sharp stone.
94,"...have you tried shaving without soap with a single blade razor?    How much worse will a ""sharp stone"" be?"
95,"This is the weird part for me, when people post pictures of younger characters with sexual innuendo, can I ask how old you are?"
96,"Nice try, Mr. FBI."
97,"Bruh, she aint even a loli, calm your farm."
98,Did I say she was a loli? Moron.
99,"I never claimed that you did, bruv    But she ain't even a loli, so calm your farm."
100,
101,WHO ARE YOU CALLING GORILLA CYCLOPS?!
102,I NEVER SAID THAT
103,If she’s busy Kondou should be available.
104,How cute...
105,Omg exactly haha I'm a manga reader but this scene the anime only gives me kaguya sama vibes haha
106,o kawaii koto
107,"Still can't believe this dude was lucky enough to get himself a stone waifu, who ultimately led him to her village and his new science bro     awe"
108,"She's no waifu, she's VALUABLE HUMAN LABOR"
109,Fun fact;  Kohaku means amber. Probably a reference to her hair color.
110,"Quite a few if not all of the villagers are named after rocks and minerals and metals, actually. Besides Kohaku and Chrome, there's Kinro and Ginro 'golden wolf' and 'silver wolf', hence the spear thing, and then Jasper and Turquoise, Ruri's attendants. And I think 'Ruri' is a reference to lapis lazuli from the translator's notes somewhere on the scans?  There's more but I'm just naming the ones introduced this episode. :P"
111,"I was skeptical of Chrome at first, as he didn't really appear that interesting to me. But by the end, when he cries for the millions of years of human scientific evolution lost in the Stone World, that really resonated with me. Honestly this is something we haven't really seen before. The other characters knew of the world before and that Senku has the ability to build it once again with his limitless knowledge. But we hadn't seen a person who didn't know that, that can only dream of the technology before the Stone World.     Chrome to me embodies the human curious nature, the will to discover and question the status quo. His genuine drive to discover and learn are just so endearing. I really hope to see him more, and if the OP is to go by, he seems to be one of the main protagonists :"
112,"Chrome really ends up being the heart and soul for this episode. He's a also a pretty solid person to interact with Senku. Instead of a big oaf, we got a Scientist Sorcerer in training!"
113,Chrome has been here for only a few minutes but their interactions at this rate.     popcorn2
114,"seriously, who can compete with science bros?     grandhype"
115,"A friendhip was formed between this men, this men of SCIENCE!!"
116,Truly a covalent bond
117,Sorcery bros 
118,Noone can.
119,Oh fuck.    He knows about the blue crystals!    HE  KNOWS  ABOUT THE BLUE CRYSTALS!
120,Isn't that like the plot of Breaking Bad
121,"To be fair, ""Yeah, science!""  is  the entire premise of this story."
122,Excellent point
123,I got a lot of blue crystals from gacha games :
125,"As an anime reader  yes i read anime deal with it i'm pretty aware of it.    Hell the bs that ""Taiju was the MC on the first chapters"" its unbelievable taking into account THE DAMN NAME OF THE STORY."
126,   Anime reader       ???
127,"Well, there are subtitles unless you understand Japanese.    More likely they meant manga."
128,"I know, was just pointing it out"
129,:
130,The MC hair is also something you cannot miss.
131,"This is very unfortunate, but the guard who didn’t get the cool spear is gonna be a test subject."
132,My mind is taking me to really bad places.
133,Some of these reactions will always make me lose my shit.
134,"He's got Best Girl Yuzuriha with him, so I'm sure he's more than fine     smugkaguya"
135,Nerdy kids instantly bonding across a millenniums-wide generational divide over their shared love of gathering pretty rocks is extremely relatable.
136,Senku and Chrome
137,"Chrome is great because at a base level he shares a lot of Taiju's ""simple but earnest"" character traits, but he also combines that with a genuine enthusiasm for science, which makes for a far more interesting foil for Senku than Taiju's ""dumb oaf"" shtick. It also actually allows Senku to show more of his positive qualities as well, and show that he isn't just a pretentious dick who thinks he's better or smarter than everyone else, he genuinely just loves science and is actually thrilled to have somebody he can share that with."
138,That's why this show feels so much more alive with him and chrome talking. They just work off great with each other and Chrome's arc in the manga is probably my favorite.
139,"Senku seems to genuinely admire Chrome for being able to figure out and build up what he did starting from literal zero. Sure, Chrome isn't anywhere near Senku's level as a scientist, but he didn't have the entire aggregate knowledge of humanity to stand on."
140,"Thats the vibe I got too. Senku's moment when he realises that even if he died, there was still other humans that would pick up the torch and restart scientific discovery from scratch was great.    I think that really humbled him, to think that sure, he has all this knowlege, but it was acquired at the peak of civilisation, yet Chrome had started from absolutely knothing and was already making great strides relatively speaking. as a scientist, you can't help but admire/respect that."
141,"Senku was standing on the shoulders of giants.    Chrome would have been one of these giants even without him.     His discoveries would have been the groundwork for other ""sorcerers"" to work with"
142,"That's the impression I got. Senku was thinking that he himself would have never done the ""idiot"" work necessary to get the science ball rolling if there wasn't ground work already in place for him. That he would probably be one of the ""extras"" in this world if he never knew about science"
143,"He totally would join in as well, nothing can stop his love for science.      Instead of idiot work he dismissed it as elementary school science experiments, until it hit him that even our elementary or almost any minimum possible science knowledge in our world is still miles ahead of a primitive stone world.       Senku is probably exactly as inquisitive and curious as Chrome, the difference is that Senku had access to more stuff to experiment with. he started out pretty basic in his flashback as well    Also I wouldn't be surprised if this guy is still leagues stronger then Senku just because of the world he grew up in"
144,"Well, that's assuming he could successfully germinate his knowledge.    The amount of knowledge he acquired from literal 0 is  massive , especially for a teenager. And humanity doesn't tend to have the best reputation of accepting large scale change happening so fast.    The other people just think he's some weirdo who likes rocks, he'd have to invent something seriously impressive to start proving himself.     Senku was able to easily impress with feats of engineering, but chrome is more of an alchemist, so he'd be more likely to die from exploding himself in an experiment."
145,"Very good point especially about him blowing himself up, lol.    In a small village like this people dont seem to mind what he does, but unless he discovered something imediately practical nearly all his knowledge would just be put aside and forgotten by the others.    Well unless he manages to find some other curious kid to mentor, which honestly sounds easier as a sorcerer/alchemist then as a normal scientist in our times :p"
146,assuming he doesn't get killed by religious extremists...
147,"Yep, after watching this episode one more time, Chrome is officially my pick for best boy"
148,"Yep. I like him as well, certainly a big upgrade over Taiju who was basically an airhead."
149,Some still say Taiju is still collecting shells on the beach. Still collecting.
150,"He knew that science is what's gonna heal Ruri and every other human who suffers like her, and after hearing what Senku told him about how advanced the world used to be, and how many opportunities lost because the world is petrified, he felt sad and angry."
151,"i mean think about it. Chrome grew up probably watching countless people die around him from sickness or starvation and knowing that in the modern age, Ruri's illness wouldn't be deadly just an inconvenience. Of course he'd be angry."
152,"I didn't even think of it that way.     Shit, knowing that would make me livid"
153,"Cause in the Stone World, no doctors, no medication and hearing about that age.    If Chrome had been born a modern day man, he would've probably gone on to become a doctor."
154,"no! his curiosity would make him a researched no matter the field, doctors heal and he would not need to learn how to heal in our society right?"
155,"Unless he wanted to. You can still choose to, if you wished. Or he could've gone on to become a pathologist or an engineer.    But that Chrome will never be born. We got the bright eyed, curious young scientist who's going to help change the world one step at a time with Senku now."
156,"Yeah, I mean, it's no wonder why the girl's sister was so worried about her. In a world without medication, even just a cut can be the death of you if you're unlucky."

159,"Chrome was just great.    I mean, Senku's one thing, someone who already knows all this stuff and how to apply it, but it gives me goosebumps to see a person who didn't realize something was possible before suddenly learn that a good thing  just might  be within reach and then vow to pursue it. It's a kind of ""moonshot mentality"" that I wish I saw more of in media."
161,"No, I mean, more shows that cover this topic, not just Dr. Stone. A Place Further than the Universe and parts of Steins;Gate are the closest I can think of at the moment in anime. Anne McCaffrey did it periodically in her Dragonriders series of books. I can't think of many well-written examples outside of those."
162,"Ah, yeah obviously in other media.     I was talking specifically about more moments like this in this show, even better ones. Little misunderstanding on my part there.    If we wanna have a more mature discussion about storytelling, stories are always a reflection of the time they are written in, and imho, we're simply and sadly not living in a ""moonshot mentality"" time at the moment. There is no ""we'll set foot on the moon"" of our times, and I think stories being written currently reflect that. Current Zeitgeist is more a warning of Pandoras Box, reflected in things like Black Mirror and other stories.    The closest I can think of in the spirit of this positive mentality is honestly old Star Trek, at least when it comes to morals. Which is also why the Star Trek movie was so god damn disappointing."
163,As a manga-reader; Chrome is best boi.
164,his interactions with senku made the manga so much better and the comedy of those 2 is brilliant
165,A fellow man of culture I see
166,Is the manga still a long way to its end?
167,Yes
168,It’s not even half done. Not by a long shot.
169,"Chrome is possibly the most endearing character in the manga, and yeah he’s one of the main protagonists"
170,"that's exactly why he's my 2nd favorite char, only 3 characters missing from my top 5."
171,Kaseki. Kaseki.
172,Chrome is easily my favorite character. He gets better and better
173,"I hope they explain to us why he doesn’t know anything about the “old world”.    It seems like Senkuu is implying that people most have un-petrified hundreds of years ago, and these are decadents of those people.    Still doesn’t explain why nothing was passed down at all?    I would also love to get a canon answer if Senkuu’s hypothesis is correct. Like technically, it is possible that maybe some people never got petrified to begin with.    Either way is fine, just please give us an exact explanation!"
174,"Bits and pieces got passed down, but let's be honest, most people don't pay attention in science or history or remember these classes. Most people also aren't Senku or Homare from Sounan desu Ka, and would be pretty helpless without technology. When every day is a struggle to survive, your vague memories of the periodic table isn't worthwhile info to pass to your kids.    I had to inform one of my coworkers last month that Alaska was not an island, and Mt. Fuji is a real place in Japan."
175,Really? He thought ALASKA was an island? How?
176,"Because US mapmakers tend to throw it in a box along with Hawaii and sometimes Puerto Rico on the bittom left hand side of the map, and then some don't draw in Canada to help communicate that it's attached to a landmass. TL;DR, she had never taken time to really look at a full map of the world before, which is a surprisingly common issue in the US."
177,"That's so weird. Maybe i, as a non north-american, always saw the america map as a kid which clearly shows Canada and Alaska right there."
178,"True but what about buildings, plane, technology? They didn’t pass it down that humans used to be able to fly and travel insanely fast?    Chrome clearly knew nothing about the old civilization, so I’m confused what happened here."
179,"What would they pass down? Just the simple fact that humans used to be able to fly and travel insanely fast? What can they even do with that information?    ""We used to be able to do all these amazing things.""    ""How?""    ""IDK LOL""    It's not unreasonable that, somewhere along the line, people started thinking these ""knowledge"" are useless and abandoned them and started focusing on not starving or freezing to death."
180,"   What can they even do with that information?    Inspire, of course. Much as birds first inspired us, one could use the tales of the old world to give everyone goals to achieve."
181,"Suppose Atlantis existed and was a completely lost technological civilisation from 10,000 years ago, and suppose the myth of Icarus was really what remained of the memory of them using gliders to fly. Would we  ever  think of it in that way, or just think it was a random fantasy story?"
182,"I mean you say that but that is more or less how the people of old used to do things. Hear stories or observe things and become inspired, then inventing.    Flight is the most obvious example here. It's easy to see what inspired humans to try flying, and we have a decent length history of people attempting and failing to do it before the Wright Brothers.    That said, a story such as Senku's is much better the more of the information you can preserve. In your scenario, the main issue is that a lot of information is lost completely and so the story completely changes form.    In Senku's case, he has the means to record it all, and with his genius he could probably find a way to mass-produce that information once survival isn't a priority. The depth of knowledge he can preserve not only inspires but informs, and stands as a good reminder of ""This is what we can achieve if we put our minds to it. Use that brain, knuckle-head."""
183,"Well, my point is more, without specific instructions, those stories based on reality will do no more good than inspiring as much as a myth could. And their reality will also be lost to time, so that destroys the element of certainty that comes with knowing that at least it  can  be done."
184,Maybe for some reason they decided not to tell their kids and pass it down? Either they gave up such things as being lost forever or someone like Tsukasa won?
185,"Reminds me of Yugas in Indian mythology. Humanity goes through a cycle of 4 periods. In the first and best period humans are much taller, live much longer, there is no crime, no agriculture or mining has to be done because the earth yields the wealth automatically, etc. After a few centuries such stories of technology would sound like mythology that doesn’t literally exist or is seen as religion, such as Astra superweapons described in ancient Indian battles."
186,"Maybe someone like Tsukasa was around in that earlier awakening and higher knowledge was suppressed.     You'd think writing would have survived unless there was a major population decline like a famine or plague and the survivors didn't pass on their skills, focusing instead on practical skills."
187,How is Alaska not an island?
188,It's connected to Canada on the eastern land border. An island by definition is surrounded by water on all sides
189,Holy shit it's connected to Canada?!
190,Yes    
191,Woah
192,I mean... what's even their explanation for all of the petrified humans laying around? Statues?
193,"""There once lived an ancient race of man who was REALLY into masonry.  I mean, look at that detail!  It's almost as if the statues were once real people."""
194,"So true. Obviously the story is just starting, but man do I hope they explain a lot of these things happening."
195,All your questions will still be answered in the anime I think.
196,"Everything gets explained, don't worry about it. Dr.Stone is one of the few manga that follows up with satisfying answers to most of its plot threads."
197,There is an explanation pretty much later in the manga.
198,Just wait for it :
199,"That honestly seems realistic to me.  We don't know how old these people are, but let's assume we're dealing with at least two generations if not more.    Any normal person who got revived in the world of Doctor Stone would be lucky if they could make everything that we see in the village.  They'd barely be able to get subsistence farming going at best if they're a modern person.  So after that original person or people die, they take a lot of knowledge about how things were and at most leave stories about it.  Give it a few more generations and that would be forgotten, leaving a pretty primitive society.    The unrealistic stuff is Senku being a walking, actually useful Wikipedia and thus able to rebuild everything."
200,"They do know  something ... manga spoiler""The 100 tales XD."""
201,"Senku said what I was thinking exactly when you meet Chrome. He perfectly embodies how humanity has continued to grow over all these years; with, as you say, a complete curious nature. It shows that even if Senku hadn't woken up or any other man of science really, that curiosity would have driven things forward no matter what"
202,"Maybe a bit of a spoiler but to me Chrome ends up being as good a scientist if not better than Senku. Senku is clearly smarter but Chrome's curiosity and willingness to learn and innovate are what really drives the science world, not just brains."
203,"Problem Senku has, are the tools to create the Technology we have today. or would you build an Mobile with just an Stoneaxe or something right now from the Anime?"
204,I completely agree.
205,"For me, Chrome embodies a RAM-eating piece of software! Hopefully Senku meets Firefox soon!"
206,If I were in Chrome's position I'd be royally pissed too.
207,"All the first scientists were considered sorcerers and alchemists, so Chrome is a very fitting character for someone to be exploring all these things."
208,someone aced english
209,I think this episode just set in.... stone that I fucking love this series. Chrome is just great!  A primitive man who's made scientific progress on his own. It really brought back memories when I used to be very studious and curious about a lot of science in general.

212,"For anyone wondering why the robot had a straw hat, the when this chapter was being released in the manga, it was around the same time as One Piece's 20th anniversary so they had all of the ongoing series have someone wearing a straw hat in the chapter as a tribute."
213,"Oh man, even as a manga-reader I forgot about that lol.    It's pretty funny that they left that in, I wonder if the animators were confused."
214,"Weird decision from the animators to change the ribbon's color from red to white, probably made the reference go over most people's heads."
215,Which robot ?  Could you give me the time code of it appearing ?  Or just more infos
216,It was at around 20:30 When Senku was explaining what civilization before Stone World was like
217,"Hurray, science buddy! In a lot of ways Chrome has given Senku exactly what he needed, which was a stockpile of potentially more difficult to find minerals and plants it seems. This should accelerate things quite a bit I'd imagine."
218,Considering that Senku is planning on making an antibiotic. Thats a pretty big step.
219,"It’s not a huge step, given that he has all of the materials he needs. My bet is he’s going to make a primitive form of penicillin.    I’m also taking a bet that Ruri has some kind of lung or throat infection, probably bronchitis or pneumonia, given the coughing"
220,"Making penicillin is pretty easy. But making enough of it, and purifying it to actually be useful is no mean feat!    Here's the patent of the first process that worked.    You need a decently stocked chemical lab to produce useful quantities of the stuff. You could go the lowtech route and just use the acid step at room temperature, but you'd have to commandeer and rot a large part of the village's food supply to get enough of the damn antibiotic!"
221,"  Eventually found in a rotten Melon on a Peoria market    how?    it always boggles me how scientist able to find something new on unexpected place like that. like, what goes through their head that made them goes ""i think i'll check that rotten melon""    same like the new water bear species found on a moss patch in a parking lot"
222,"They had some hints. First of all, the penicillin that makes your bread moldy only grows on surfaces. So it is really hard to produce it in large quantities as you'd need loads of surface area.    Ideally you want a mold that acts like yeast: Doesn't need a surface, just dump it in a big barrel with foodstuffs and let it do its thing. So they knew they had to look for molds that grew in fruits and other roundish things.    Secondly you want a mold that grows fast. If it grows too slow, all the foodstuffs gets eaten by other crap and there's nothing left for the mold.    So they set up a worldwide search where scientists would take soil samples, rotten food, garbage dump samples and so on, and see if anything grew at an appreciable rate. If it did, they'd send the sample to the lab, which checked if the mold actually produced a good quantity of penicillin. It was during WW2 so they were kinda desperate to find something ASAP to keep the soldiers from dying, so funding wasn't an issue.    Took 4 years, but eventually they found a suitable strain in that moldy Melon. Then they blasted it with X rays to force it to mutate into an even higher yield strain. And THEN they could finally mass produce the stuff."
223, spending years digging through rotten food and garbage    YEAH SCIENCE
224,Yeah that mind numbing hard work is a staple of science.
225,interesting...    thanks for the info :D
226,TIL
227,"I was about to look all this up, thanks for the info."
228,"Thanks for the lesson on Sorcery, Senku     ;     -Chrome"
229,Also fun to mention that they injected it into clothing to keep it hidden from the Nazis.
230,Man it's cool and inspiring to see how much determination and work it takes for scientific breakthroughs.
231,"  Then they blasted it with X rays to force it to mutate into an even higher yield strain.    And when I thought this story couldn't get even more awesome, suddenly the freakin'  mold  gets a superhero origin story."
232,Digging in garbage to find something that will cure them from all the disease from digging in garbage
233,"Louis Pasteur was looking for a way to cultivate bacteria and hadn't been successful until one day one of his lab assistants forgot a baked potato in the lab and the next day it had all this weird spots, they saw them in a microscope and realized each spot had one specific kind of bacteria in it.    This eventually led to petri dishes"
234,Its always a mixture of Vague idea's and luck when it comes to scientific discoveries.     Very seldom are they found on purpose. The general idea is known but the thing discovered usually isn't
235,"Yeah, but that was what, in the 1930-40s? It’s not like Senku is going to be figuring this shit out for the first time. He grew up in an era that has streamlined processes. He’s not reinventing penicillin, he’s taking his knowledge of modern medicine, taking what he has on hand, and with a little bit of shounen protag luck, making science happen. It won’t be that difficult, relative to his previous goal of making guns while being chased across stone age Japan by a JoJo caricature"
236,"Modern day streamlined processes generally focus on increasing the production yield. Which requires waaaaay more advanced crap. The Minimum Viable Strategy is what I mentioned in the second paragraph. Which is: rot half the foodstuffs of a minor village, separate out the penicillin with some kind of acid. And then hope that nothing toxic got into the resulting mixture that you feed to the patient."
237,Dr. stone tends to streamline or simplify things simply so they don't spend 80 years actually trying to do shit. Such as the cart Senku made in the beginning of the episode. Something like that would probably have needed to take a day or more to build at least to a point where it doesn't fall apart on a bump but senku was able to build it no problems in around give or take 20 minutes.    The process and method will probably be boiled down to a very basic level with the yield he gains being drastically increased for times sake.
238,"With the power of manga, all you need is:    1 The required components     2 Possibly some tools     3 The infinite implied time between two panels to finish any manual labor"
239,That’s his power as a Shonen protag
240,"If you've read the manga  Jin  he makes a warehouse with idiotic amounts of mold cultures in an attempt to breed the right one. It's a slow process, but it could work here too."
241,"The process doesn't seem ""soo"" bad...    First you make the fermentation broth of penicillin, which isn't described in the patent, but presumably you put the mold into a vat, feed it, and let it grow.    Next, you chill the broth to just above 0 C. You don't want to freeze it, but penicillin decays above 0 C, so you want to keep it pretty close to freezing.    Next, you filter it of any solid material. Strain it, centrifuge it, whatever.    Next, you add some acid to bring the pH down to anywhere from 2.0, and 3.5, although some care in selecting the acid is needed, otherwise you destroy the penicillin.    Next, you use a solvent to separate the penicillin from other acids. If I'm understanding this correctly, this is basically like adding oil except with something like amyl acetate to a water-mixture containing the penicillin. The penicillin prefers to hang out in the ""oil"", while this won't be true of all the other impurities. As part of this step, you're supposed to add water so as to attract anything that loves water and get rid of that too.    Next, you concentrate the penicillin with a base dissolved in water. Basically, you've got weak acids and strong acids and penicillin, so this step has your base react with all your weak acids so they drop out of the solution.    Next, you separate the various strains of penicillin by adding a slightly stronger acid. The stronger acid kicks the penicillin out of solution, and it precipitates out.    By now, the only acids in the solution are either stronger than penicillin or they are the ones you intentionally added... so, you just add another solvent, this time something like Chloroform, that attracts your penicillin and all the stronger acids hopefully stick to the rest of your solution, and you can extract it.    Next, you can remove a few more impurities by adding charcoal etc.    Next, you precipitate out the penicillin by adding an alkaline base. I think this should retain any acids that liked chlorofoam or whatever for some reason, but were stronger than penicillin.    Finally, you evaporate away as much of the liquid as possible by exposing the solution to a vacuum at low temperature... remember, this whole thing needs to take place as close to 0 C as possible without freezing.    That's it, right?    tldr: Filter, use a number of solvents and acids to precipitate or separate out any acid that isn't penicillin, precipitate out the penicillin, and finally, dehydrate for use."
242,"Yea it is pretty doable if you've got the materials and equipment. A dedicated hobbyist could whip up a batch in their garage if they wanted.    But Senko has to do this not in the modern age where all the solvents, refrigeration and pumps are readily available. He'll have to repeat the process in the stone age. Which means all of the required materials need their own production chain set up from scratch. The acid is pretty easy, but the rest requires some serious fucking chemistry setups.    The chloroform needs to be made by mixing methane and chlorine at 500 degrees, cooling the batch to liquid and then distilling it. The cooling down requires them to either wait until winter so they have access to ice, or to build a refrigerator good luck building a fridge out of sticks and stones.... And don't even get me started on the Amyl Acetate, whose precursors have another pretty convoluted production chain that can't easily be replicated with stone age tech."
243,"Except you don't ""specifically"" need chloroform... or any of the other chemicals listed explicitly. Don't forget, this whole process is designed to distill high purity, high yield penicillin. That solved a very specific problem... we had a massive quantity need of high quality, low mass, penicillin. And a need to separate the various strains of penicillin so we could figure out which one was best and prioritize making that one.    I'm no biologist, but you could probably get away with filtering out the solids and ingesting the resulting low-yield mixture at a higher dosage. If you couldn't do that, my instinct would be to precipitate out the lower strength acids, clean out the precipitate, and then precipitate out the penicillin and call it a day.    ""High Purity"" is more of a transportation, packaging, and optimization thing. It's not like your body will die if you ingest a little bit of water. Or acid. Your stomach is filled with acid. It's all about the dosage, and you only need to get the dosage to safe levels before you're good to go. It's only when you're mass producing the stuff because millions of people desperately need the shit that maximizing yield becomes critical."
244,"Yea, hence why they are probably going with the low tech method I described in my post:       You could go the lowtech route and just use the acid step at room temperature, but you'd have to commandeer and rot a large part of the village's food supply to get enough of the damn antibiotic!"
245,"I mean. You need to rot the same amount of food stuffs regardless, no? You don't make more penicillin appear by concentrating it. You just get rid of impurities... which means the penicillin was there to begin with, regardless of how pure you make it.    The real concern is how good of a strain of penicillin you start with. Really good bacteria = great. Really shitty bacteria = terrible. BUT, knowing this anime, excessive hard labor is apparently instantaneously accomplished."
246,The problem is getting a good enough strain. They could use the strain that grows on bread but it would make the project take years to grow enough food to ferment as that strain is incredibly low yield.
247,"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if that was just a common cold. People used to die a lot from that before medicine was invented"
248,"I don’t think a cold would ever last as long as they’re implying. I’m thinking a lung/airway infection because of that, the coughing, and the fact Senku jumped right to antibiotics, so it’s gotta be serious. Antibiotics can’t help a cold or the flu"
249,Could be TB?
250,"It very well could, I know both pneumonia and TB can be slowed with heat treatments so that makes sense"
251,"Common cold is not cured by antibiotics. If someone were to die from common cold, it would probably be due to an opportunistic pathogen like TB sneaking its way in.    But viruses are never affected by antibiotics. Because they utilize host cellular machinery, any antibiotics would be Pyrrhic victories at best."
252,"I know that. It would be quite a funny twist honestly, if the antibiotic wouldn’t work because it’s something as trivial as common cold is, at least for our standards."
253,"Yea I was just pushing back on people dying from common cold. Stuff like flu was deadly, but it’s deadly today. With the exception of some very specific anti-virals being introduced, The mortality rate from virus have been fairly constantexcept for attendant co-infection, but rhino and enterovirus just lack the punch to kill people.    EDIT: and obviously a big help for flu and diahrettic viruses are treatment of symptoms, but again this does not really come into play with common colds where symptoms are minor."
255,"That's the wrong spoiler syntax.      This is the correct way.  Spoiler source""Spoiler goes here"""

309,"Yeah, and it's the voice actors first big role which is why I was wary at first, but now, after this episode, I'm 10 billion percent sold on his voice."
310,Damn i love new VA's. They always bring something new to the table.    Don't get me wrong i like hearing two or three characters on every single anime being voiced by Genichiro Ashina but it gets tiring sometimes.

323,Yes and no. External factors put more wear and tear on your body which will make it look and act older.

Or someone who abused their joints with intense manual labor will have body pains and arthritis like a senior citizen the way someone else wouldn’t.

334,"Shhh, let people enjoy their ships"
335,"Okay, now I'm understand why the manga is so popular."
336,Yeah shit only gets better from here on.
337,anime-only here. Hearing this makes me happy.
338,Also anime-only here. Every week these people keep saying the show is only going to get better and every damn week they're right.
339,"This is only the tip of the iceberg, believe me."
340,And it's like this all the time. The mad man Senku announces that he will create something that we take for granted and blows everyone's minds while also teaching people a lot of cool stuff.
341,"im regretting how i gave up on the manga so easily last year, only made it to the manga equivalent of them starting to make gunpowder before dropping it. if someone had just told me to hold on till the island arc i probably wouldve read the whole thing"
342,My thoughts exactly. I was getting bored already from Taijou's big dump oaf with a hear schtick. But this episode was a breath of fresh air. This episode made things a whole lot better.
343,"What I like about Kohaku character is, a part of her strength and dexterity came from ""daily training"". She had been carrying a 50-litre pot back and forth a step hill several times a day in who knows how many years. For her sister. Damn siblings love is my weakness. She might be hot-tempered, easy to jump to conclusion, quite like a shounen male MC, a muscle brain, etc but she's strong, reliable, quick-thinking and best of all, genuinely care about those around her, not only her sister but also her friends. She's still my top1 favourite character till the latest manga chapter. Also my top character based on manga newest ranking: 63182.    And Chrome my boy! His voice here was just like I imagine. Can't wait for more of his spot light.    ""..There's always an idiot who'll try anything, and the shiny monkeys will inevitably create a technological civilization."" The science never lost, as long as there are human, who full of curiosity about nature, who want to grab the natural law in their own hands. The Human Technoogical Civilization will always rise, and rise and rise again no matter how many time you tried to shot it down. Because exploration is in human's nature. That simple line and Chrome introduction had moved me really much and the science-loving part of me cried out loud the first time I read it in the manga. And the part when Senku told Chrome about the stories that happened 3700 years too. Dr.Stone never failed to make me cry at simple things like that."
344,"She also has a verbal tic where she Naa's a lot.     Now that I think about it, the way all the characters talk is quite unique. I dunno if the manga's writing conveyed that or not, but it's a nice touch from the VAs and script.    edit: tic, not tick"
345,"On the same note, I love Tsukasa because he's Captain America in disguise!!! /s"
346,I was really starting to tear up a bit and Chrome just went and cried. That moment was just beautiful
347,"This episode was everything. Science, comedy, emotion. This series just gets better and better"
348,"A weird thought, but in this new society the term scientist could totally become synonymous with mage/wizard. I can just imagine Senku running around shouting that he's the imperial wizard, head of the new nation E=MC2 and that all other nations need to submit to his empire of science.    Also, antibiotics is probably the best thing he could make right now. Improving the lifespan of the average person will greatly increase the speed of their technological advancement. Just imagine where we'd be today if the founding fathers of modern science lived as long as we do today."
349,Clarke's Third Law: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Senku may as well be a demon lord in the stone world.
350,New LN title: I was reincarnated on earth 3700 years after the apocalypse as a demon lord?
351,Is dr stone an isekai
352,"It is, in a weird way. And we all got tricked into not seeing it as one."
353,"And lately some isekai have been pulling that ""trick"" of later in the story revealing that they are still on Earth but hundred of thousands or maybe millions of years in the future."
354,So just the ending of planet of the apes?
355,Planet of the apes is an isekai...
356,"Arguably, the twist of Planet of the Apes is that it's  not  an isekai."
357,"Fun fact, that's an adaptational issue. The original novel  totally  was an isekai."
358,"Based on the wikipedia summary, I don't think that's correct. The reveal is simply discovered by going on a circular return journey via spaceship rather than seeing the Statue of Liberty."
359,"Based on having read the novel just a few weeks ago, and then rewatched the movie right afterwards, I'd say it is. I don't think the point of the ending was that it was Earth all along and for some reason, the spaceship ends there by mistake...  twice , but rather than they were two different planets, and just when the guy goes back thinking he can bring the lesson home to stop it happening, it had already happened in the time he was away.    The ape civilisation in the books is much more modern compared to the one in the movie in the movie, that was toned down for money reasons, it was cheaper to have them be more primitive, because they basically straight out took over from the pre-existing technological human civilisation. If it had been literally the same - down to the last city and monument - the protagonist would have been able to tell. Besides, he straight up comments multiple times on how different the sun and moon of that planet look from the ones of Earth. And it's not passed enough time to justify those things changing naturally in some way."
360,"Okay, I concede that you're right then."
361,Scrapped Princess did it first I think.
362,Which isekai are doing this? I'd really love to see them.
363,"I can't think of animated one at the moment but a couple recently made that reveal are spoilers""The manga Parallel Paradise, this one is very, very NSFW. And the light novel 'How a realist hero rebuilt the kingdom', both are still dealing with that new information. """
364,"Lately? Now and Then, Here and There did that two decades ago. Isekai was a thing in the 90s, it just wasn't LN garbage."
365,Futurama is an Isekai now.
366,"So we've been tricked into watching another Isekai? Damn, first Zombieland Saga tricked me into watching an idol show and now this."
367,Ohayou Isekai Good Morning World!
368,"As Gigguk said, everything is isekai."
369,"Dude, I'd watch the SHIT out of an isekai where a Senku-like character calls himself a demon-lord and people think he's sorcerer in a fantasy world.    Something like GATE or Suisei no Gargantia, but exclusively about science."
370,"IIRC the manga about an isekai'd pharmacist has this, partially. The modern knowledge of medicine makes him a godlike healer.    I say partially because after a while he learns actual magic."
371,"Real talk, why do all LNs do that bullshit with their titles? Is the market so oversaturated that you only have your title to grab the attention of the customer?"
372,"  I can just imagine Senku running around shouting that he's the imperial wizard, head of the new nation E=MC2 and that all other nations need to submit to his empire of science.    I'm not sure I can. Senku loves science too much to gussy it up as magic. Even in this episode people kept saying 'magic' and sorcerer' and Senku just kept correcting his title to 'scientist'."
373,I wonder if he'd prefer the term alchemist since alchemy was a more scientific magic.
374,I mean he just used a philosopher stone this episode...
375,"Alchemy isn't just a fantasy magic thing, it was the legitimate precursor to chemistry.    Also to note, it's much less broad than ""science"", and senku will be doing more than just chemistry."
376,"  Kohaku Stitch      Ruri Stitch    So I'm guessing Kohaku and Ruri are twins? I am curious about Ruri's sickness.  Her only symptoms so far from what we've seen are coughing and a weak constitution. Senku creating an antibiotic for her isn't a bad idea, even if Ruri doesn't have an infection, the antibiotic can still be useful to someone else in the future.    Chrome is a fun character! There's really no stopping humans and progress. If Tsukasa wants to stop all of science then he might as well kill everyone who's alive in this world.       I do wonder what generation Kohaku and Chrome are. If the first human has awakened around a hundred years ago like Senku is guessing, they're probably around 4th or 5th generation."
377,  Her only symptoms so far from what we've seen are coughing and a weak constitution.     Oh dear. This must be the mysterious Anime Disease. She's not wrong about only having a little while left to live.
378,She probably got hit by the most devastating weapon known in Japanese history -   the atomic bo..   ..anime rain!
379,Isn't it the common truck that is the most dangerous?
380,What's dangerous about a teleporter to a fantasy world where you get super powers and a harem?
381,"Because not all trucks are equipped with a functioning Kadokawa Device. Secondary characters, as far as we know, get this a lot."
382,I mean you never know. Maybe that truck from the first episode of Death Note had a Kadokawa device on it as well.
383,"Your fantasy world might be Konosuba, where you get neither of the two."
384,"Technically he could have gotten a super power, but he chose to take something useless with him instead."
385,"Nothing, as long you don't teleport bread."
386,"The biggest tragedy of Dr. Stone isn't that humanity was turned into stone, it's that without humanity to maintain Truck-kuns throughout the world the common delivery system for new people and heroes for other worlds has dried up.    Imagine how many other worlds have been wiped out because useless goddesses and other deities called for help from careless or unlucky teens and nobody ever came. Tragic."
387,visual aid
388,"Is this Itachi’s ninja cancer again? Oh no, she’s going to have to awaken Kohaku’s mangekyou sharingan right before she dies 😭"
389,I heard the only cure is to consume at least 3 hours of anime per day - In such a primitive society it's diseases like this that really threaten the population

393,I'd say the fair question as to what generation they are begs another question. If they are a fourth or fifth generation you'd think their ancestors would've passed down stories about the world as it had been before right? I mean we haven't really gotten into any kind of worldbuilding about these villagers yet but if they have no knowledge whatsoever about the world as it was before even knowledge butchered down and metaphored the hell out of through the long game of telephone called human history it may indicate that they may be older than that to the point where the stories have been forgotten. Or if that's not the case and these are in fact fourth/fifth gen humans that begs the question as to why their ancestors didn't tell them about the world as it was before.      In either case I am most curious to see if these questions get answered.
394,A reenactment of the first generation trying to explain technology.
396,True. But on the other hand humans are just as capable of coming up with religious beliefs as they are at scientific invention. Though whether it's something to do with the past or something more recent they've thought up it could go either way.
397,"All I can think of is the first generation were knot knowledgeable about science or not as much as Senku, maybe they were teens, or homeless people idk, people who could survive barely by themselves."
398,"These questions are in fact answered in the manga and should happen eventually this season, though I won't give you a timeframe beyond that"
399,"I agree with this. Especially when the guards at the gate said that everyone outside is criminals who was banished from the village. They might not even remember that there are alive humans in the stones, but just think of it as something natural to their nature. Thus this generation might spann back a long time for their origins to be forgotten."
401,"Even if she's dealing with some viral disease, due to the lack of knowledge about hygiene or medicine and limited available treatments there's a good chance of contracting a bacterial infection like pneumonia.    The other easy medication I'd expect him to produce some kind of basic anti-inflammatory medication. Of the three plants we were shown, Felwort would make the most sense for a fever. Canker root can help with symptoms of Malaria but we can safely eliminate that as she'd already be dead. Sweetroot shouldn't even be in Japan so Senku should stay clear of it."
402,Sounds reasonable
403,"I had forgotten Kohaku mentioned Ruri had gotten sick recently, so originally I thought ""well maybe she's anemic.""     After her coughing though, it's definitely something simple like a cold. There's probably enough herbs in their area that could help with the symptoms like the ones we saw and you mentioned, but if it's a cold then all they pretty much need to do is to make sure she's hydrated water and herbal teas and make sure she's getting enough vitamin C and all of that.    Though if it's just a cold and it's really debilitating her, she  could  be anemic I don't know why that's sticking with me so much or have something worse."
404,"I doubt it's anemia for the sole reason that that's not something Senku can really treat, especially as their deit likely contains lots of fruit & red meat so iron & vitamin levels should be fine.    Her collapsing due to the cough matches up with a bad chest infection, probably from pneumonia, which is also conveniently treated by antibiotics."
405,"That's true. I also can't imagine they don't waste iron richer organs of the animals they eat like the liver, kidneys, and heart.     The biggest thing would be that hopefully Riru doesn't have and autoimmune disease as well."
406,I assume Senku thinks it's TB.
407,"That's a possibility. I was puzzled when he said antibiotic, but animal TB can infect humans. But if so, she'll require treatment for months. I'd also expect Senku to go for a synthetic antibiotic - some, like isoniazid are relatively simple chemicals, compared to trying to find the right mold or bacteria and cooking away for years."
408,"Isoniazid would only work if it was TB or another mycobacterium though.  Senku can't be sure what she's suffering from at this time - in addition to TB, it could be another bacterial infection such as pertussus or pneumonia, a viral infection, exposure-based like emphysema, or something genetic."
409,"I was thinking TB in particular because it has a chronic form - most bacterial infections quickly kill you, but you can suffer from TB for years and still survive.  She's probably a bit young for chronic exposure problems like emphysema.  In my opinion, a heart/lung injury or deformity, whether congenital or acquired is the most likely problem, but that wouldn't be treated using antibiotics, so given that Senku has decided to make some as a treatment, I think TB is his guess."
410,"That is the thing I am most curious about!     It seems like Senkuu is implying that people most have un-petrified hundreds of years ago, and these are decadents of those people.    That still doesn’t explain why nothing was passed down at all?    I would also love to get a canon answer if Senkuu’s hypothesis is correct. Like technically, it is possible that maybe some people never got petrified to begin with.    Either way is fine, just please give us an exact explanation!"
411,By passing down do you mean stories of how the world used to be? I could give you a spoiler answer but am using the app so can't do tags
412,It seems like a lot of people have implied that it will be revealed soon. So you don’t have to do that.    I just wanted to know if we would indeed get a canon answer on how this new civilization started and why they know nothing about the old civilization. Which it sounds like will be explained.
413,Yes. Should be within a few episodes
414,"I've been thinking about this.    It's very possible that a few average Joe's got unpetrified. But since they're average they couldn't do anything other than make basic structures and have babies.    How useful do you think you'd be if you woke up in that world? Sure you'd know about how the world used to be, but odds are you would not have a clue how to science anything. All you'd be able to do is tell stories of how things used to be. Hundreds of years later those stories would become legends and myths if they are remembered at all."
415,Would twins be referring to each other as big sis/smaller sister?
416,"One came into the world first, so even with twins you have a big sister and a little sister."
417,The onee-chan privilege     gintamathispleasesme
418,like a certain pair of twins from RE: Zero.
419,"The Nakano quintuplets don't, but they are just one example, so who knows."
420,What are you talking about? Ichika is the big sister there.
421,But no one calls her that.
422,"yes, in anime i've definitely seen that before, blue exorcist has the twin brothers have that dynamic, or at least have the younger one call the older one as ""big brother"""
423,Twins might do so playfully or if the society placed emphasis on first born privileges.
424,"They aren't twins, just sisters that look alike and Rui is the elder"
425,They are not twins but it's a really small town I don't think there is much genetic diversity.
426,"Maybe Chrome told Senku a bit more about her, off screen. Maybe Senku conclusion is pneumonia, who knows. I does make sense"
427," ""If the first human has awakened around a hundred years ago""  Why a 100?"
428,"Huh, so that one in the OP is Chrome, not Taijou..."
429,For some reason I thought all those jokers in the OP were all going to be from being unpetrified and was extremely confused why Senku would let out a kid and an old man.
430,"Haha, yeah that too."
431,"Trust me,  that  old man would have been worth unpetrifying..."
432,I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought he was Taiju with a headband lol.
433,I noticed that as well. I was curious about when the 2nd protagonist was going to appear. What role do you think he will play? Like kirito and eugeo role? Senku being kirito obviously.
434,Maybe like Holmes and Watson?
435,Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice?
436,Probably like a Doctor to a Nurse.
437,"Low-key at first I thought the same too. Specially when Senku was about to get killed by Tsukasa, I thought it'll be a change for Taijou in honor for Senku."
438,"yeah when they showed everyone in a blue robe I was like ""OHH, so Taijou is gonna become one of the villagers with Senku, awesome!"" and then Chrome appeared and I realized who it was"
439,"I love that it takes Senku all of five minutes to realize that he's dealing with a real scientist in Chrome, even when the kid himself claims to be a sorcerer. Someone who collects everything he can and learns as much as he can about what he's collected. That's the beginning of the scientific method. Certainly not all of it, but Chrome was getting there, even without Senku's help.    When Kohaku was thinking 'Why are these idiots so impressed with rocks', Chrome was demonstrating what he'd learned from them while Senku was gifting Chrome with what he already knew about them. Everything in that hut is marvellously useful. Chrome knows that. Senku is going to show him  how ."
440,"Wow, I'm surprised, not only did the secret Joestar technique manage to survive 3700 years but it has also evolved. The Joestar bloodline is strong in Ginrou..."
441,Gyarus also seem to have evolved     ero
442,The middle one has an Ara Ara Aura
443,"Uh, do you know what a gyaru is? Cause those aren't gyarus."
444,"don't you get it? they've E V O L V E D, beyond our comprehension and understanding of current day gyarus."
445,Are you talking about the super tanned girls with drag queen level outfits?  I think that's like extreme gyaru.  I've seen characters labeled gyaru just because they wear some makeup / jewellery to high school.
446,The one on the left looks like Nico.
447,the twin tail one is cute
448,Ginroustar.
449,"Chrome's quite the eccentric guy, I appreciate that he represents the drive for scientific progress regardless of era. Rather nice of him to collect a bunch of materials that Senku needs to start his advancement.    Chrome really took that History lesson to heart, his scientific curiosity is pretty refreshing. I guess medicine really is the first important step here for them."
450,"The new direction they are taking is pretty good, even if it dragged on a little too much with waiting around for exaggerated reactions.    I hope they don't instantly let Senku persuade them, and we explore their cultural slowly accepting his fast-paced science revolution."
451,"  I hope they don't instantly let Senku persuade them, and we explore their cultural slowly accepting his fast-paced science revolution.    Obviously once he heals their leader they are going to get behind him in full. That's why she's sick."
452,"Yeah that will likely be the case, but I'm hoping for at least some resistance."
453,I felt it could go either way honestly. The fact senku set up a little work station directly in front of the gate that they specifically mentioned he's not allowed to pass makes me think it could be half and half. Like he'll be working on medicine where everyone can see and probably ask questions as to what he's doing. He'll probably earn their trust except for the gold spear guy until senku asks to try the medicine out on the girl. Probably by taking some first to prove it's not poison or offering his life if she isn't cured. That would be my guess as to how it might play out.
454,"Like with most societies it will probably have 90% accept it, but then have 10% still be scared of change and will resist, potentially violently."
455,Kinrou already apply your idea for resistance
456,"I see why you want the resistance, but I hope if there is any it's actually done well.  Usually when that type of stuff happens in any story it's annoying and empty filler.  I'd like to see there actually be emotional stakes, maybe people go over to Tsukasa's kingdom and it creates emotional stakes."
457,"Ah yes the whole we have one problem we think is impossible to solve but is deeply important to us.            You solved it? Damn, but uh, grrr...."
458,The resistance will come before the cure. Why would they let some random outsider just feed a strange magical substance to their sick VIP?    They'll need convincing.
459," That's why she's sick.    This is hilariously cruel from a in canon perspective     Rui: why, why am I here, just to suffer?      Bochi: well yes, but actually yes you're just a plot device       Rui: surprised Pikachu"
460,"on the one hand it  is  awfully convenient. On the other hand, their reason for keeping him out is pretty nonsensical. ""Outsiders aren't allowed in the village, because the only people outside the village are people who were exiled for crimes. You were clearly not exiled because you were never part of the village, and honestly the existence of  anyone  else should be kind of causing us to re-evaluate our assumptions about the world, but fuck it you're not coming in anyway."""
461,When they said that I assumed that they assumed that he was the offspring of an exile.
462,Yeah that's the implication
463,"Being suspicious of outsiders and not letting them in makes sense to me.    They're a primitive society with little if no knowledge of history and seemingly the outside world which in world without telecomms and motorized travel makes sense, they wouldn't stray that far from water and their village.  The only people they know of for sure are people they're exiled from their village. They also know how fragile their community is.  An unknown illness or invasion could kill them all.    So they keep out anyone they don't know."
464,"I don't think you understand tribalism and how core it is to humanity.    Senku has shown them no benefit to his presence in their village, and letting an outsider in could cause any number of negative things."
465,Curious on why Senku thinks Ruri has a bacterial infection. Could be anything but hey I'm still hyped.
466,"Well, even if it isn't, making antibiotics should always be a priority if the resources are available. He probably decided to make it as if it is that it can be solved, and if that doesn't work then he will know that that's not the cause of her illness."
467,Gonna turn into an episode of house. Lol
468,"It's lupus, obviously!"
469,But it’s never lupus
470,Except for that one time
471,"Hey, it actually might be."
472,1. Make antibiotics    2. Make Vicodin
473,Dr Stone is a medical drama.
474,clearly what we need to cure her is mousebites
475,If it was a virus and her immune system didn't take care of it then she would either be dead or symptomless. A long term illness like this is almost exclusively the realm of bacteria. Given the health of the sister it's unlikely to be genetic either. But really it comes down to the fact that if it's not bacterial then there's nothing Senku can do to help anyways and this is his best shot to get the village to accept him quickly.
476,"Well, since they won't let him into the village to examine her, that's probably his best bet. It's definitely a gamble."
477,"I mean it makes sense, if it was something simpler they would have cured it by now. If it’s not bacterial then senku probably wouldnt be able to make a medicine anyway. Antibiotics cover a lot of different areas"
478,"pretty much this. Treating viruses is way harder, and antibiotics would cover most bacterial infections unless they're resistant which is probably less likely when the selective pressures of antibiotics hasn't been around for almost 4000 years. ANd if it's genetic she'd be pretty fucked even with modern tech"
479,"Yep, its the shotgun approach, and considering their living conditions, a bacterial infection is extremely likely if its isolated to a single person. Viruses tend to sweep through a population and hes heard no mention of it being beyond a single person, so it'd be a safe play to assume its bacterial in nature."
480,It's the easiest thing to directly treat if you know about it and the chance of some secondary bacterial infection coming in whilst her immune system is weakened is pretty high in a world with little to no knowledge of medicine or hygiene.
481,"it's a pretty decent guess, given the zero information he has to work with. Plus even if it's not  her  problem, antibiotics are still one of the biggest medical advances out there, especially if you limit your scope to things you don't already need large amounts of scientific infrastructure to create. The other big one is sanitation, but that's not nearly as much of a problem when you're still in a small village where injuries that require surgery are few and far between."
482,"It's implied they talked off-screen     ""Didn't you say you could heal her?"""
483,Maybe she’s got cancer.
484,"More likely some congenital disorder.  Chrome became a ""sorcerer"" to save her, which means she's been suffering from this for at least as many years as he's been sorcering.  If it was cancer, she'd've died by now."
485,'Sorcering' is an official term now.    I want to take an initiative to add it to the Oxford dictionary.
486,"Dunno about Oxford dictionary, but the term does seem to exist."
487,"Man, that ending puts into picture how the discovery penicillin put an end to most of the diseases humans suffered from for two million years"
488,"As much as Tsukasa wanted to create a communist primitive utopia, he forgot there is no way to stop human curiosity.    There is no stopping to science.    Tsukasa may kill the individual, but he cannot kill human nature.    Even if he miraculously managed to create his commie tribe, he will eventually die and curious people like Chrome will keep appearing, advancing society."
489,"That was a great moments and just kinda shows, even if he does kill Senku and Chrome, there will still be some idiot willing to go beyond his comfort zone. It's just a fact that Tsukasa is not willing to think about."
490,As the saying goes...     rum
491,"Maybe he doesn't really care to think forward - like many leaders, he wants to make the world as he wants right now and benefit during his lifetime - so what if it sets everyone back. Unfortunately, there are many ideologies that aim to make things ""good"" and then stick to that. If you want to make things better and as such rock the boat most importantly in terms of social order, get out!"
492,True.
493,"I read a really interesting opinion just two days ago or so. It was basically about how civilization is progress, and what did work for previous generations and made them prosper military service, insurances, whatever might not work for the current generation, since times and the world are changing. And that's why people need to change, too. And how we do things. It's why the ""back in my day, I worked a lot and was able to just study and buy a house, so you should be too if you weren't so lazy""-mentality fails so incredibly hard. The tricky part is to figure out what might be universally true, or at least long-term.    Anime oversimplifications aside, I really do believe that forcibly trying to keep the status quo is the wrong move."
494,"My take is that he is completely willing to think about that and what will happen, and that's why he is so cold about it.        He seems to wish complete control upon the future of humans as a benevolent savior ready to do anything he needs to protect his utopia, so he probably already plans to kill anyone who shows interest in producing real scientifical results.     The question is if someone like Chrome would be considered indeed a scientist or just a random dude doing silly things unlike the manly hunters who deserve respect because they are manly men and providing food.    Outright killing him would be probably not that useful unless he wants to establish some kind of religious order of warriors that in the future will stop human curiosity as he would do.     AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND that's how he we get a totalitarian religion that burns witches and wizards."
495,"i dont think it has anything to do with ""commie"" utopia.its like what you said,he wants to make the world as he wants right now."
496,"Tsukasa is trying to implement a communist system similar to Pol Pot's. Lots of people killed, including scientists and educated individuals since he considered them a threat to his rule. People were forced to work in collectivist farms without the reliance on technological advancements."
497,Chrome is quickly becoming my fav character
498,"Yeah, wizards are the best."
499,"Yer a wizard, Chromy"
500,"I don't think Tsukasa is upset at science, he's just upset at  Senku using science  to revive  everyone  instead of just the youth    Edit: ""is"" instead of ""isn't"""
501," I don't think Tsukasa isn't upset at science    Agreed, he knows that technological advancement will inevitably lead to a similar civilization."
502,Technological advancement wouldn't necessarily bring with it all the land ownership monopolisation and wage slavery that has him murderous.
503, This is the idea I had. I made a typo in the comment
504,"Sorry I meant ""is"""
505,I know just messing with you.
506,"There's a big problem with Tsukasa's plan of reviving the youth. They might and I think they will end up wanting the old civilization back too, his plan is bound to fail whatever happens with Senku or/and Chrome."
507,  human curiosity.          KININARIMASU!   curious
508,Senku should quickly find Eru and de-petrify her.
509,That part was the part that made me felt Dr.Stone is  the one . My science-loving side just cried out loud at that part. Chrome is such a great character that represent the curiosity and exploration nature of human beings.
510,"You’re right, if you look back into history. Science hasn’t always been the only way to look at the world. We once thought we were the center of the universe. I’m assuming tsukasa wants to mold the world is whatever technological advancement he seems fit. That couldn’t even be keeping the world in medieval times for all we know."
511,"I loved that moment in the manga and here, even if Tsukasa wins, somewhere down the line there'll be someone among the children of the children of the children of Tsukasa's empire who would want to know why something is the way it is, why something Works, he or she will have curiosity over things, and that can never be stopped."
512,"It's really the moment senkus ideology won, beyond all doubt. Now reality just has to follow. :"
513,Tsukasa could set up a Pol Pot style primitivist regime that has roaming military police that kill anyone who seems too curious or intellectual.
514,"yeah, it just keeps getting better!"
515,"Tsukasa is anything but a communist, he's an authoritarian military leader trying to achieve his own goal at the cost of everything else."
516,"there is a little detail you oversaw. he want only revive young peoples. ""Lord of the Flies"" Vibes"
517,"Now, now, his methods may be detestable but Tsukasa is simply aiming for a society without greed, betrayal and other crimes, a world like that village, where everyone can live happily.    Senku is the main character but if he just goes around depetrifying people willy-nilly we'd soon run into a ton of troubles and he would regret it, he's good at science but he can't manage people. The moment people get their hands on guns he's fucked unless he monopolizes it and at that point he would be on a slippery slope."
518,"Yeah, communists, famous for their hatred of science.    edit: lmao why is this controversial, propaganda is a hell of a drug."
519,You forgot you're among anime fans. Of course this is controversial to them.
520,"There is a lot of left wing anime fans but Reddit tends to be very liberal/libertarian so it makes sense they don't like any anticapitalist talk.    I'm kind of shocked they have never heard of things like the space race tho, that's just pure ignorance."
521,"Well, yeah. The issue is mostly reddit. Yeah, but that's normal they've never heard it, I'm actually not really surprised to be honest."
522,"You are sarcastic but communist regimes haven't been very fond of scholars in the past, Mao and the Khmer Rouge aimed their hatred towards scholars explicitly for the goal of a perfect communist state, since they were seen a class above the farmers, and Castro started a witch-hunt to writers that spread what he considered dangerous texts.    Kind of like Tsukasa wanting to eliminate Senku's dangerous knowledge."
523, Mao and the Khmer Rouge aimed their hatred towards scholars explicitly for the goal of a perfect communist state    Worth mentioning though that the Communist NVA and the Soviet Union backers waged war against them to stop that.
524,"  communist regimes    That's a contradiction in terms.    This is a very important bit that a lot of people get wrong. Communism as an ideology is by definition stateless and classless. There is no regime because everyone has equal social standing. Nobody has the authority to order anyone else around.    There are countries that tried to reach communism through marxist-leninist theory, where a small vanguard party grabs control  of the state and uses its power to move the country to communism. This has almost always failed right after the ""give the vanguard party near monopoly rule and hope they give up their power"" step.     But it also means that while those countries might call themselves communist and/or socialist, in reality they are just a dictatorship. Usually called state-capitalism in socialist theory since the workers still don't have control, its just that the boss has changed from the unaccountable capitalist to an unaccountable party official. It's kinda like a 'Democratic' 'Republic' of North Korea situation: they say they are one thing, but in reality they really aren't.    So when you are talking about a historical communist country, keep in mind that that's not the same as an actual implementation of communist ideology. Just a particular failure mode of a particular strain of thought that has largely been discredited within larger socialist theory.    Tsukasa is closer to a primitivist/wanna be warlord since he's the strongest than he is to a communist."
525,"I can't believe this has gotten downvotes, this is a great post!"
526,"Tsukasa wants an applied communism state and in his mind he took the first step by killing the world only scholar, so the theory you mention is pretty irrelevant to him.     Tsukasa is closer to a primitivist/wanna be warlord since he's the strongest than he is to a communist.    He said he wanted to stop ownership of resources because of the beach/seashell incident and vehemently opposes to the ""old rich people"" existing, explicitly because they will bring the concept of owning stuff and money back.    Seems like every communist movement on history in it's early days.    The village is a great example of primitivism, they own stuff but are primitive even if unwillingly, what Tsukasa advocates is against owning things."
527,"Sure, he talks about abolishing wealth and stuff. But the important bit here is that he ALSO talks about a world where the strong rule. The former part sure as hell is communist, but the latter part completely invalidates it.    You know how both liberal capitalist democracy and socialism talk about freedom, but have very different interpertations of what that freedom actually entails? Capitalists will tell you that you are free, but then require you to spend 8 hours a day working for an undemocratic overlord or risk being deprived of your primary needs. To a socialist that's not freedom at all. Same kinda deal here. He talks about a world without money and ownership, but then he interprets that as ""The strong get to rule"".    And yea, the village is much closer to primitive technology than whatever Tsukasa cooked up. But note that they still have a clergy priestress girl and presumably a chieftain. So they probably aren't completely communist since there are still distinct classes in society."
528,"HOLY SHIT, someone that actually knows what theyre talking about    THANK YOU    It's so damn infuriating talking about socialism and someone going ""well do you know how many deaths communism has caused!?!?"""
529,"Yea, the cold war propaganda runs deep... The moment you say anything about it, people's brains just turn off. Artist impression of the average redditor reading the word communist.    It's silly as shit, not to mention harmful."
530,"Hunting down opposition is hardly a ""communist"" vision, you can find that in pretty much any capitalist nation. Cuba and the soviet union have/had incredible respect for education, huge focus on science and high level of both men and women in stem research.    Thinking that science has anything to do with capital is such a weird thing to think i don't know how to even respond to it."
531,"the guy you're replying to defends communism like the lapdog he is wherever I see him pop up, oh the wonders of RES."
532,Can you actually respond to that guy and tell them   why   you think they're wrong rather than just calling out the very fact that they have a position they commonly defend as if that's somehow supposed to debunk their logic?
533,"I can, but I will not. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to point out to chapos why their ideology falls apart in reality you’d understand how futile the effort is. No amount of historical evidence of philosophical arguments work, because everything tried ‘isn’t real communism’. It’s almost like these fools have not even read the manifesto their ideology stems from, how can I argue against a position they don’t even understand they hold?    Also, if anybody does not understand the dangers of this ideology by the time they get out of high-school with a western education them their education system has failed them. We manage to make most people understand why nazi ideology is not to be repeated, but somehow the experiments in the east and the deathtolls seen there under these systems is easily brushed aside. No, I shall debate this with any commie who doesn’t first show a willingness to alter their position if presented with arguments they can’t defend against."
534,"There are primitivists who want humanity to go back to a stage of civilization where we lived in basically communist tribes, before the dawn of agriculture.    You're right though. People in communist organizations like the Venus project think communism is pro-science. Marx thought science just progressed inevitably, and that this technological progress would bring about a communist, post-scarce Utopia at some point.    But the point is, it's completely accurate to say Tsukasa wants a primitivist, communist world where we lived in tribes in populations under Dunbar's number. There's a funny meme that describes this well. It shows a primitivist following a communist around. The communist asks why the primitivist is following him. The primitivist answers that communism is the fastest way to decimate the world population and bring us back to a tribal ""post-scarce"" society. The communist tells the primitivist to f off. Whether the primitivists are right or not is a discussion for a different subreddit."
535,"Tsukasa i don't believe specifically cares about science. He just does not the world before the stone world to ""reawaken"" Senku being the only known man on earth capable of doing this. As he can revive people given the proper materials. And was probably a day or two away from properly developing a pipegun or musket.    To Tsukasa as long as the ""cancer of the old world"" doesn't awaken again. He could care less what happens to the world. If Senku abandoned the idea of rebuilding the old world and resurrecting the people Tsukasa thought were the cause of the petrification then he would have allowed Senku to go about his business."
536,Can't wait for the real life Dr. Stone in a couple of millenia after capitalism kills us all in this next century.
537," no way to stop human curiosity.     There is no stopping to science.    Is there some kind of explanation or is it just a minor plot hole? As you said there is no stopping, yet chrome or anyone in that particular village seems to be starting from zero. The technical know how may not be pass down, but common knowledge like microbe should be common right."
538,"   The technical know how may not be pass down, but common knowledge like microbe should be common right.    For big part of human history people didn't knew of microbes.    Before 1665 people didn't knew microorganism existed.    Since modern humans have existed for 200,000 years...this means we spent 198,335 years without knowing of microbes.    The village people seem to have discovered how to preserve food the drying of the fishes and basic pottery/textile crafting making them effectively a primitive society."
539,"We made more scientific advancement in the last decade than from 0-1500 A.D. Scientific progression is really slow to start, but exponentially accelerates."
540,"More like communication technology has been accelerating, and we're able to get more like minds together on narrow topics. Used to be that someone in a random nation state noticed something and it would take months or years for this information to slowly leak to the rest of the world. Now not only has the internet reduced information travel time, translation technology often results in scientific papers being from people working anywhere on Earth. If you think things are insane now, wait ten or twenty more years for when typed and perhaps even spoken machine translation is seamless."
541,"The idea is that if they are descendants, shouldn't they at least have understanding of some basics even if nobody has the technical know how of building fighter jets. You know simple chemistry, biology and physic knowledge at the very least which the village don't seems to be displaying."
542,"Remember the village was originally founded by people who woke up from stone. They must've had at least some basic knowledge like making pottery and food preparation, and passed it on to their kids. Heck they can speak Japanese with Senku. Why they didn't pass down  everything  about the previous society? Dunno, maybe they didn't deem it important or didn't know enough. Also they're probably occupied enough trying to survive daily"
543, common knowledge like microbes    The first human observation of microbes was in the 17th century using telescopes but there are much much more ancient human texts that speculated on the potential existence of such things.    It certainly wasn’t common knowledge until the latter part of the 20th century.
544,Microbes are such mindfucks. Like imagine theorizing that billions of little imperceptible animals were  living in everyone's body all the time.
545,"I think it works out to there are 10x as many not-so cells on/in your body compared to the number of ""you"" cells."
546,"That only applies if those from the village are actually NOT descendants of the modern human population that got unpetrified right?    Otherwise these ancestor should be easily able to explain about microbe because I am pretty sure every human in jp from senku's time understand that. Especially if preserving of food knowledge is passed down rather then a ""rediscovery"" by those descendants."
547,Tsukasa may convince everyone that the world is indeed flat.
548,He can just start a sect and burn every smart person.
549,Never go full Khmer Rouge. :/
550,"I hope they end up realizing Tsukasa has a point, the same point the Unabomber had, the societies we built restrict people. But I hope they find a way to have the miracles of progress and freedom of primitiveness"
551,It isn't very often that an anime makes me want to go read ahead in the manga instead of just matching pace but Dr. Stone is trying me right now.
552,"Same boat man, but I think its more fun to watch the adaptation blind each week instead of knowing whats to be expected"
553,I recommend reading the manga. Great art and comedic timing plus spoilers don't really matter for this show.
554,Will do that after the show finished airing
555,"If you give in, have some snacks prepared ahead of time, this manga is a page turner and makes you want to binge it once you start reading."
556,I accidentally binged all of what was out. I'm usually an anime only. I wish the anime came out faster
557,  Kohaku is cute af. How can anyone even criticize her is beyond me  
558,Like this.
559,"I was going to make a joke about the chins from The Promised Neverland, but that's much funnier"
560,That's exactly the character that came to mind when I saw her.
561,O  w  O
562,"You have now started an great collage of Kuhaku, I hope you will continue to add to it after every episode no matter the cost. You have to do it, for her..."
563,I'll try my best =
564,I'm just looking forward to the cosplays.
565,So Senku was the legendary Super Sayan-tist all along?
566,"10 billion points for that one     smugpoint    Also, behold the absolute power"
567,"You see Tsukasa, you're not dealing with the average scientist anymore."
568,Tsukasa: Have we been here before? I feel like we have been here before.
569,So that's what Vegeta said. Goku's father was a great  Saiyan -tist.
570,Your father was an average fighter... but a brilliant Saiyan-tist!    Glad I wasn't the only one thinking of that.
571,"Duuuuuuude, this episode was too goooood, best one by far, looks like Senku has a new science buddy"
572,"The episode was pretty nice and all, but did anyone notice how Chrome made a fucking Jojo pose when he was introduced."
573,🦀🦀 Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is gone 🦀🦀
574,Lmao someone actually comes into this thread to downvote every single comment when the discussion is posted. What is wrong with some people?
575,Someone hates science must have failed a year
576, Tsuskasa disliked this post
577,It’s tsukasa
578,"Honestly, if someone is wasting their time going onto a discussion post just to downvote every single comment, then they have way too much time on their hands."
579,"It doesn't accomplish anything either, as Reddit karma is irrelevant. Leaving a nasty comment would be way better"
580,They most likely have a bot for it. I can't imagine somebody sitting down and downvoting every single comment in a thread.
581,They must be the same person voting 1’s on every discussion thread
582, bruh
583,This phenomemon seems to be more prevalent for:    ipopular shows of the season    iiecchi shows     iiishows that deal with controversial topics.     kaguyasigh
584,"With the way our society is going, I can definitely see intelligence being considered a controversial topic."
585, lyingawake
586,"So, everything?"
587,That's the downvote titan striking again!
588,"You guys have the wrong idea about why this is done. This happens in every popular discussion thread, not because haters or people who don't like the show are doing it. It's Karmawhores who post comments and want to make it more likely for their comment to end up as the top upvoted comment. The most upvoted comment is usually the one that gains the most upvotes early on so that people coming to see early discussion upvote that comment even more until it snowballs and ends up the top comment due to its higher visibility at the top of the page.     Downvoting everybody else makes it more likely that your comment ends up winning the early rush for upvotes.  TL:DR - Its vote manipulation."
589,"My take is that there are salty for not getting many or any upvotes for they comments, of course i'm just guessing."
590,This isn't the only thread I've seen it on. I don't know how often it's so ridiculous
591,The show is not their favorite.
592,"It might just be multiple people downvoting for all sorts of reasons. People here even downvote just for someone having an opinion they don't like. It is just reddit being reddit, being filled with the childish and the intolerant."
593,"I'm really liking Chrome, he could easily be the protagonist of his own show. Now as anyone there lack the petrification scars I wonder how many years ago did their ancestors come out? And also, if there are any other similar groups out there? Aside from any created by the banished ones."
594,That's a good point. If Senku getting destoned was not unique after all then there must be small societies like this all over the planet.
595,What if it's only Japan?
596,I Bet all my money on Tsukasa recruiting the banished people
597,"Yeah, I can totally see him doing that, as he will sooner or later target that village and he will either need people were from there to know more about it or sent spies to get some knowledge, but as they don't accept outsiders I don't see that tactic working."
598,"My boi Chrome is here and he sounds great.     Kohaku's intimidation face reminding me of Kaguya's ""How cute"" face.    Senku's funny face when Chrome showed him ""Rainbow Bridge""    That Dragon Quest reference though.    Great episode."
599,"and the fact that this is Chrome's VA first big role second role overall, man, they found the perfect VA."
600,"  Kohaku's intimidation face reminding me of Kaguya's ""How cute"" face.       o kawaii koto"
601,"Chrome and Senku will make  formidable duo. Also, the wayChrome looks like a shonen protagonist  only to be anhilatted by Senku is hilarious.    Luckly for the sick girl, pretty much any disease outside of cancer and genetic diseases were wiped out alongside humanity, so antibiotics will make her fine as long as no one in the stone world decides to fuck a monkey."
602,I think you're overestimating humanity.
603,But stone world gorillas are just too cute!
604,"Most diseases are communicable between people and animals. Different animals have different reactions to different diseases though, some are carriers that aren't hurt by them, some die from them same as humans, and some things humans are immune to they can pass to animals. Plenty of diseases that humans had would continue to live on in animals."
605,I really want to know the genius that actually fuck a monkey and contacted a disease that still has no cure.....
606,"I don't want to be that guy but I do these things for a living so, yeah, I gotta do it.        That's not how cancer works.     Cancer isn't just determined by your genes but it's heavily influenced by your condition as a whole.    So yeah, she could totally have cancer because she was unlucky as fuck.          microbiologist mode: off  "
607,"Yes, he said outside of cancer of you read his comment."
608,"Damn, I am stupid."
609,Kohaku's personality is so damn fun to watch in this show. Holy shit.     Chrome's also entertaining since his introduction. I love how each of these characters all stand out in some way or another.
610,"Incidentally, fire gilding, the method Senku used to gold plate the spear tip, is actually extremely dangerous. He's correct about the smoke being poisonous but even a little over time will poison you."
611,"Senku's approach to health and safety rules is ""well, looks like all the inspectors are stone statues now sooo...""."
612,"""Gold smoke! Don't breathe this."""
613,It's actually the Mercury that you have to worry about.
614,"Ah yes, I've been looking forward to this part of the series so much, and its so satisfying to see it finally get animated.    My only complaint is that I'm really not feeling Ginro's voice. He just sounds young as opposed to the endearingly pathetic voice I had in mind for him."
615,"Semi manga spoiler""Recent chapters do say he has a young/girly voice so it does at least fit."""
616,He sounds like a whiny brat
617,As it should be
618,Chrome is finally here. 😤 Best boy incoming!

624,Senku found his science buddy!
625,Senku found his Jesse Pinkman
626,Damn this episode really spiked the quality of the show.    Can't believe i was so happy when Senku was happily mentioning rock names that are completely unknown to me.
627, minerals
628,"The power of bubbles!!!!    This episode was immensely fun just for the fact we got to meet two of my favorite characters from the manga, being Chrome and Kinro. Ginro is fun too, but he still has a way to go.     One of my favorite scenes of the manga was here too with Chrome finding about civilization! It's a powerful moments and whoever voiced him killed it.     I also have finally noticed Kohaku's weird space between her eyes. Now I can't unsee it! Yay..."
629,At least Kohaku is pretty gorilla.
630,Why Gorilla's always gotta be blonde?       yousaidsomethingdumb
631,Maki from Fire Force isn't blonde.
632,Shes an ogre though.
633,WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY!
634,Huh. I just realized Maki is just an older akko from little witch academia.
635,well.... she's a witch
636,Otae from Gintama isn’t blonde.
637,Kondo is
638,F for Chitoge
639,Grillilla
640,Dicks out
641,hello there totally not Einstein
642,Dr. Wily!
643,"Fuck, it got interesting. Honestly this show had not clicked for me, but this episode, this Chrome guy... fuck, I'm hooked"
644,"Science fight! Science fight!    Damn, I just love how in this anime every character has  CHARACTER . Like Kinrou between the stiff type and Ginrou being the scared type. They aren't just all pushovers like in most anime where they see a guy falling from the sky and welcome him into the walled city or some shit.    Reminds me of the Slime anime."
645,"I'm at a loss. This episode did such an AMAZING JOB at hyping us up for the rest of the series. I feel that with minor tweeking it couuld serve to be the first episode honestly, because these characters are above and beyond more interesting. But at the same time, I am so hyped for everything that is developing in the background so far and I am just as invested in that. It's just a shame that the first couple of episodes weren't as much of a hook as this one because I found it hard to recommend this series previously. All in all, I'm glad it came around with this new cast because I am sooooo eager for more!"

648,Senku and the Lioness are pretty cute together
649,"Ah, I love it. No ""beating around the bush"" crap. He straight up told the other person about the human past, meanwhile in any other shonen you would see how that guy would know it in the last episode with a cliffhanger."
650,"what chapter of the manga does it stop off here?, really cant wait anymore because i wanna find out EVERYTHING."
651,"It stops at the end of chapter 19, so you can start with chapter 20."
652,Thanks!
653,Read chapter 19 to see the math battle.
654,"Honestly, start from the beginning, the manga goes really fast and there's details that haven't been adapted fully or were differently presented. Still a fantastic series either way, but I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
655,"I feel you man, I'll probably end up doing the same!"
656,Im at chapter 50 rn and will probaly finish the rest tomorrow! Defientaly worth it
657,It's doable. I got to chapter 50 a week ago and finished the rest last night.
658,"I'm not sure about this episode, but it was definitely a transitional ep between the end of the last arc and the beginning of a new one. So I'm hopeful, but remain unconvinced with regards to the new characters.    On an unrelated note, props to the unknown dude in the past who got themself un-petrified and decided ""Hey, everybody got turned into rocks, so we should name our kids after rocks. That sounds right."" What a lad."
659,"Yeah, science! I'm hyped to see them create antibiotics"
660,Heck yeah...I love the new character. This anime is just getting better every week.
661,This just keeps getting better !
662,I was so looking forward to seeing the science sorcery battle animated and it did not disappoint.
663,The battle between Senkuu and Chrome was very entertaining especially since Senkuu was able to figure out all his tricks. Kohaku reaction to being called a lioness was pretty funny.
664,Every episode I'm amazed at how great this anime is. I think it might be one of the best things to happen to anime in a long while.
665,"now Dr. Stone has entered or surpassed the part where i become hooked to the Manga, and now also hooked with the Anime. until now i am satisfied with the Voice actors, if i close my eyes and wanted to give the Manga figures a voice, then the Anime reach them just fine    good work ""Team"""
666," Damn nature, you scary!     made my day"
667,"An amazing episode I'm liking Senku being in the Sensei roll. Random, but I wonder if Tsukasa will teach Taiju how to fight since he's ""ok his side"" now.    Im interested in the potential outcast society. If the main village only has 40 people. How small in number are the banished people? How many generations have they been doing that for. So many questions!!    This is getting exhilarating."
668,Good episode. Chrome is a pretty cool dude.
669,"""There will always be that one idiot who will try everything!"" - Senkuu    I loved this quote way too much."
670,"I think they really nailed Chrome in this episode, the voice acting was on point and really captured the character. However, I'm a bit disappointed with how Crunchyroll translated his catchphrase. If you're listening to the voice acting, you'll notice that Chrome says ""yabee"" a lot. This is a Japanese slang word with a lot of different meanings. In the manga, this is translated as ""bad"" meaning either ""not good"" or ""bad ass"", but Crunchyroll has given it a different translation based on the context ""oh crap,"" ""awesome,"" etc. This solution works, but the catchphrase gets lost in translation as a result. Like, what would Crunchyroll do if another character points out his catchphrase? Well, I suppose there isn't always a perfect solution when translating such a different language, and I appreciate the quality on the translation in general."
671,"One weird thing about this episode is that Kohaku says forty in english about the number of villagers, but Senku repeats yonjuuni and the subtitles say 40 so some weird dissonance happening here. I believe the manga says 42 so Senku's intelligence transcends reality."
672,"Senku doesn’t actually say anything in the manga, it just cuts to the double spread page with the names and faces of all of the villagers. I think they added the line to emphasize that Kohaku counts in English and also because many Japanese kids watching won’t understand the English numbers."
673,  but Senku repeats yonjuuni and the subtitles say 40    That's because Senku says 'yonjuu-nin' 四十人 not 'yonjuuni' 四十二.
674,"Well that would make sense, I just probably can't hear the ん because of my lack of experience in japanese."
675,"Like you said, it has a lot of meanings which means one translation cannot be a catch-all. Other characters use it too I'm pretty sure our carbonation boy will use it a lot so it wont be unique to Chrome."
676,"Up until this episode I was majorly on the fence about this anime. It felt real fast. Nothing was really happening per say. They just kept introducing characters with what felt like no plot, HOWEVER now I'm 10 billion percent on this anime. I cannot wait for the rest of the season and hopefully more."
677,1st Arc is considered slow and the weakest. It only gets better from this point. The anime had conveyed well the emotion of Chrome learning about humanity
678,Kohaku blocking Ginro Kinro while Kohaku's lovely butt being covered by that small piece of  leather
679,Wowow. When I heard new characters were gonna be switching places with Taiju and Yuzuriha I thought I wouldn't like it. But!! This is awesome. I love Chrome he's funny but a man of SCIENCE. Awesome!! I hope him and Senku work together a lot more in the future this duo is dope.
680,IT IS THE VILLAGE ARK
681,Kohaku looks like rika from digimon. The one with the yellow fox that everyone lewds
682,"I see now why people where hyping up Chrome and am also glad I'm not the only one who thought he was Taiju with a headband from the OP lol. I almost teared up a bit myself at the part where he cried after learning the fate of technological civilization.    Things are a bit too dragged out sometimes and I can't quite get over the female faces, but overall I'm really loving Dr. Stone and looking forward to Senku's nation of science."
683,Senku and Chrome are just the best duo
684,"Dr. Stone, meet Google Chrome. Best buds from now on."
685,"I love how Senku initially teases Chrome about how primitive his little science tricks are, but he truly does admire how damn impressive his accomplishments are given their level of technology. He's such a good boy.    I also got goosebumps when he explained the world before the petrification. You can almost imagine watching a show from Chrome's perspective, where he survives in a stone age civilization. This would be like the Season 3 finale where he finally learns the truth of the world and it changes everything. Essentially Attack on Titan."

688,Chrome is so awesome
689,This science bro-down is fantastic. Chrome  1
690,This episode had so much love for science. A reminder to never stop trying. It also helped that I was at the gym while watching the episode. Can't wait to read the manga after the season is over
691,"Ah this is what made me love the manga. Senku and Chrome’s relationship, together bonding through science!"
692,"I always feel so bad whenever I see the poor dog on a walk from the disaster day... He was probably stuck on that leash til he dehydrated or starved to death, assuming he wasn't eaten by a lion T_T it's like futurama and Fry's dog all over again..."
693,I read here that was the feral dog with the wolf pack in the next aftermath scene.
694,"Holy hell that last minute really got me excited, this is the best new anime of the season, it’s a delight"
695,Anyone else get really sad when they saw the puppy stuck on it's leash?  I'm pretty sure it starved their confused and alone.  Rest in peace puppers.
696,"Senku meeting Chrome only solidifies that the world Tsukasa wanted to create is futile. No matter, how he clip the wings of science and kill the precursors. No matter how slow, there will always be someone who will try things out. You can't stop imagination and can't kill progress.    While Taiju is spying to Tsukasa and only semi-acquired yuzuhira. Our boy Senku, just acquired a lab, tools, materials, an assistant, and harem kohaku and ruri."
697,"""Wait, that guy from the OP wasn't Taiju?!""    Also, nice DQ reference."
698,"Im allergic to penicillin which is found in most if not all antibiotics, and it sucks! Hope Ruri won't have an allergic reaction to that stuff when Senki/Chrome create the antibiotic. I nearly died as a baby due to a heavy reaction from penicillin.     But good episode overall! Loved the new cast and those damn faces they all pulled xD!"
699,"My mother is as well, as far as I know it didnt get passed to me, thank god."
700,Funny thing is that penicillin was discovered when sick people needed to eat something and their closest option was moldy fruit.
701," This new smart Monkey is gonna be fun.         glasses-push      I cant wait to see more of Jane, she seems fun.      Jane wants to fight Tarzan, that will be helpful.      IT TIME TO GET SOME ALLIES BABY!  AW YEAH!      Senku your scrawny ass cant carry that... good try but nope.      HE MADE A BUGGY!? HAHAHHH!      Wow a lot of people, 40 of them.  I wonder how long they have been up and going.      They dont know what bubbles are hahahahhaha.      Chrome, a smarty?  Hm ok lets see what he can do.      These guys aint gonna be able to handle Senku lol.      Senku already planning to use that ball to make electricity hahaha.      HOLY SHIT THAT STATIC HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH      So Chrome made all this without knowing anything, not bad monkey.      Battle of numbers... Monkey... you barked up the wrong tree.      Man Senku got a lot of handy stuff.  This is gonna be a major power boost.      Monkey gots a girl he wants to help?  Jane's sister?  She looks like like Jane wow.  Twins?      Preistess?  Of what?  Hmm...  damn shes not well, Time for Senku to save a girl!      Senku telling the monkey everything huh?  He could be a great ally if he knows more.      Oh shit, Antibiotics.  Thats major.  Lets see if they can pull it off."
702,"First off, nothing he’s made so far isn’t too far outside the realm of a normal person. Well... he did make rockets pre-stone world hmmmm...let me rephrase. On top of being an space engineer, he’s also a biochemical engineer as well?"
703,Well we saw him messin in the chemistry lab before the stoning.
704,"Can anyone tell me if that village are descendant of unpetrified people, or new evolution taking the exact same path.    I mean their knowledge seems to have literally plummeted back to zero. Can't be 0 knowledge being pass down unless the ""first"" ancestor started out with 0 knowledge tooeg parents died after having children but not before teaching, or unpetrified children that hasn't receive education."
705,"To be fair, if you'd be the only human left on the planet, how much scientific knowledge could you remember? How to build a house? Agriculture? Electricity? Medicine? Tools/weapons?    I'm guessing 99,9% of humankind would be down to actual stone-age level."
706,Remember? Most people never even knew.    The average person's knowledge of modern society is how to use devices other people made or take care of medical issues by just taking something prescribed. Take that away the people with specialised knowledge and they'd be in a worse state than a primitive society.
707,"I'd be able to reinvent binary and logic gates.    So, um, I'll be one of the first to starve to death."
708,"Oh I am not taking about them bringing back all the tech and stuff. It is just that going by chrome action, it is obvious he is ""rediscovering"" the periodic table. Another example is that in our modern age, we understand microbe and its importance to survivability yet the village seems cluelessdoesn't necessary means they need to have the ability to treat it, but just knowing about it."
709,"At this point, we only know as much as Senku."
710,"It didn't plummet to zero. They speak perfect Japanese, with a lot of English loan words and have real lifemodern day mannerisms. Evolution doesn't quite work that conveniently. Or fast for that matter, it's only been 3700 years.     Your money should be either on ""descendants of people that were unpetrified generations ago"" or ""descendants of people that were never petrified in the first place"". Those are the most logical possibilities."
711,  Never petrified    Wouldn't thousands of years result in language drift if that was the case?
712,What changes would happen to a civilization that would never have any outside influence?
713,we wouldn't even understand people from 500 years ago ...
714,That's probably because how much cultures mixed. But here there are no different cultures.
715,"If you wanna be spoiled, go read the manga."
716,"I can tell you right now: 3700 years is not enough for a new human-like species to evolve.    As for their actual origin, that would be spoiler territory so that is more appropriate in the source material corner."
717,Ah ok good enough for me. So there is an explanation for their lack of understanding.
718,"but the language would be vastly different. try to read something from 300-500 years ago, you almost can't understand it because it's a different kind of English."
719,"But is that as a function of time or as a function of cultural shift and societal change? This village doesn't seem to have progressed much beyond hunter/gatherer stage, so if it is that shift or change mentioned it might just not have occurred no matter how long this village has been around. It is just one of those things we can't really test to know its origin for sure.    But ultimately it is probably just a convenience to not have to go through the process of learning to communicate.    How was your comment relevant to what I said to begin with btw? My comment was just about the possibility of evolution of a new species even before the matter of language."
720," Can anyone tell me if that village are descendant of unpetrified people, or new evolution taking the exact same path.    There is no way that:     ;    A Something evolved into a spcies  exactly  like humans.    B They  just  happen to speak japanese.    C Something evolved into a new species in just 3 thousand years.     ;    So no, definitely not a ""new evolution""."
721,"Fair enough. But I was making the comment under the assumption of ""fantasy"" since the footnote at the end only mentioned whatever senku science offer are actual science. The story plot need not be.    After all global petrifaction and only on human and swallow? Plus undoing that actually heals a human enough that senku having his nerve snap can come back to life. So these are indeed fantasy settings. Oh and also tsukasa will never beat a pride of lion bare handed in real life anyway no matter how much a human train."
722,"Even if it's not completely realistic it doesn't mean the story will completely divorce itself from reality.     ;     After all global petrifaction and only on human and swallow? Plus undoing that actually heals a human enough that senku having his nerve snap can come back to life. So these are indeed fantasy settings    Actually, there is a theory that explains this and is more or less real life complying. Of course not 100% realistic but fiction never is.     ;     So these are indeed fantasy settings. Oh and also tsukasa will never beat a pride of lion bare handed in real life anyway no matter how much a human train     Well, yes. This is one of those relatively small breaks from reality."
723,It's a Planet of the Apes thing.
724,Tsukasa is quaking
725,"There was so much meme material in this episode LMAO    Hopefully Ruri gets healed next episode, she looks like a really nice sister."
726,Next episode.. pfffff   🤣🤣🤣
727,Yeah got tired of waiting so I'm reading the manga lol
728,Read it and you'll notice you've made a miscalculation...
729,Best ep yet
730,Damn do I really have to wait another week now?
731,"Go read the manga, it starts at chapter 20"
732,That puppy in the flashback though! That was dark as  fuck !
733,Aww. Senku made a friend. That's nice.
734,They are gonna make antibiotics?      Alexander Fleming would be proud. Though this time it won't be accidental I guess.
735,Me seeing the village with 40 people.    Cotton matte
736,"I just hope that if this series expands beyond 1 season that they release quicker then most mainstream animes.    I really am loving it right now, quite unique in most aspects. I personally find it refreshing and new."
737,"So now we are gonna say a big ""fuck you"" to pure chemistry and we start to do some good ol' microbiology?         Damn boy, society is going on quite fast indeed."
738,Kohaku = Tsundere
739,She is neither Tsun nor dere. She is gorilla.
740,Wait I'm confused. Where did this village come from? Does first generation just mean they were the first to wake up from the stone? And if that were the case how did they know nothing about the stone people or technology? Something like that would have had to been passed down through generations.
741,"dont worry, itll get all explained later."
742,Okay but Senku is saying first-generation like I should know what that means
743,"First-generation would be people who were alive before the petrification and were later revived.        Second-generation would be people born in the stone world, descendants of the first generation."
744,Thank you
745,"This show is all i watch nowadays, it’s sooo good!!"
746,I feel like the arc is going to be very intresting and different from four character just having conflict
747,"Shit, Chrome might actually surpass Taiju as best bro, and he managed to do that in a single episode! Now we've got the science bros!"
748,Shout out to Dr Stone for helping me understand the science behind one of the characters from Land of the Lustrous.
749,I binged 7 episodes today. And now I started the manga. I need more of this series.
750,"Anyone else feel like so much happened in this episode and yet so little? Anyway, Chrome is probably my favorite character from the Stone World so far."
751,Bruuuh Senkus face has me dying
752,"Alright guys, I'm reading the manga, can't wait to see the medicine."
753,"Antibiotics in a world where the resistant germs are probably gone.    Ah... the days of drastically improving the life expectancy of people will return.    Chrome being a man of science, who knew nothing of the old world, is a great character.    Senku is right. Even if he falls, people will find a way."
754,"Kohaku lied that her extra trip time was because she decided to dick around. But as soon as the inner guards talk to the outer guards, she’ll be busted about the stray she took home. Wonder why she took that tact."
755,She probably just didn't want to worry her sister.
756,She'd probably get in shit if she was honest about getting stuck under that tree.
757,"Also this has been the best episode so far , hope they stick with the village arc for a bit and not make a whole episode about Tsukasa , Taiju and Yuzuriha meeting again because the last couple episodes were meh"
758,"Easily my favorite episode so far. This series has never been among my favorites, I mean, the previous episodes were entertaining and I liked them but I definitely hadn't enjoyed them as much as this one. Kohaku is great!"
759,"Is it just me or does chrome look like Taiju , my guess one of the first people to build the village might have been relative of Taiju."
760,"Finally, now this anime is starting to get REALLY good! Also, fuck yeah, we finally saw a glimpse of the loli Suika! I look forward to seeing more of her!"
761,This show just got so much more interesting
762,"Her mouth says no, but her uncanny eyes says she's ready to repopulate the world with Senku's science children."
763,"Yah, Chrome!    How does Senku know that Ruri is suffering from a bacterial infection? Antibiotics would be useless against anything else."
764,"Yah, but what else should it be? If its a Virus, there is not ""much"" he can do, or it could be a parasyte, but i assume that wouldve killed her already. Creating Penicillin i assume doesnt take too long and covers a shit load of illnesses."
765,It' time for an episode of Dr. Senku's amazing medical know how!
766,"Yes, creating penicillin is a good move, but he seems way too certain that it will work.  Could be parasytes - not sure why you think those are always quickly fatal, could be a congenital condition, could be some trauma that caused long lasting damage, could be tons of other things my non-medical mind can't think of."
767,i honestly am really curious what the Bacteria to Virus/ect. infection ratio was back in a time like theirs.
768,Back in a time 3700 years in the future? :P    There are no vaccines so that's one thing that's bad.
769,AntiVaxxers are the responsible behind the petrification?
770,Could be. But if you can't fix it why worry about it? Bacterial infection seems like a good guess and the easier one to treat.
771,"And even useless against many bacteria, not all antibiotics have a wide area of effect!     Still, it's a good idea.     I mean, deal with viral infection is complex in general so you should start checking for common bacteria or simply some other kind of secondary damage derived from a previous infection.    Given this fact, there is also the detail that viruses are... strange things.    Some evolves a lot Flu some doesn't evolve at all Measles so dealing with them would imply some tests, while bacteria would probably be a far less problematic thing to deal with."
772,"I mean even if he doesn't know what it is, creating antibiotics is probably the best option because there is a decent chance that it is a bacterial virus."
773,   a bacterial virus    A what now?
774,"This episode felt kinda slow to me. I like the show overall but it feels like it runs at 80% speed. The conversations/monologues just feel kinda long and drawn out sometimes.    It was a bit frustrating that Senku wasn't questioning these people more about what they know or how they came to be there. With how knowledge driven he is it seemed a bit out of character. Yea he assumed this civilization sprung up from a different generation but I would have liked to seen him ask what they though about the stone statues, what their history is, how their society works, etc. Hopefully we'll get to that in the future episodes.    I like Chrome so far and Senku having an apprentice like sidekick is pretty nice. Adding a primitive civilization is a good way for Senku to show off all kinds of neat inventions. The primitive people reacting to modern science is a cool aspect I'm looking forward to!"
775," It was a bit frustrating that Senku wasn't questioning these people more about what they know or how they came to be there.    They are primitive so of course in case they even know anything, they probably don't understand it themselves. Plus Senkuu knows he has time, why should he ask important things before he even got their trust. That would just make him look shady if he tried to get information out of them."
776,He doesn't really care about anything other than TL.
777,If Senku doesn't ask it means he probably figured out already.
778,"He's a scientist, not an anthropologist."
779,Wait wasn‘t penicillin better than Antibioticum?
780,Antibiotic refers to any medication that kill bacteria. Penicillin is a type of antibiotic derived from the mold penicillium and was the first good antibiotic that was discovered.
781,I imagine pencilin will be part of it
782,Penicillin is an antibiotic and really easy to produce; just let fruit go bad and harvest the mold.
783,"Guess Reina Ueda is voicing another character this season, first Gray and now Ruri, bless her soothing voice.    Chrome hearing about everything from the old world must have been mindblowing!     Edit: I'm liking this character."
784,Best Gorilla
785,damn loving this new arc so far and it just started. HYPERS.    the comedy this episode was also just perfect imo
786,Less Tsukasa and more everything else. Top episode
787,Chrome being JoJo posing is hilarious LMAO
788,Why do these posts get gilded?
789,"So Ayla sleeps with knives. Good habit to have in this stone world.        Is everyone other than me in this stone world a gorilla?      Yes. I mean that's usually how this kinda thing works out anyways. Your pretty smart Senku I'd figure you'd figure that. So perhaps for your future benefit you should make some dumbbells out of rocks or something to lift in your down time.      Yeah Senku may need to work out the kinks in his Flintstone mobile.      Well that an impressive village Ayla has there que the music: So this Chrome guy uses hits flair for performance and in this case pretty decent scientific knowledge pull the wool over on these ignorant masses. He reminds me of Oz from Wizard of Oz, they're both charlatans but both are good people at heart. Hell I may start addressing Chrome as Oz from now on, seems fitting enough, right?      But anyways its good to see that Senku has a new friend and ally in science who shares his passion and a lab already set up to boot. And I can only wonder how Oz will react to the prospect of revival fluid and bringing people back from petrification and what impact it may have on the village."
790,Why are you calling Kohaku Alya?
791,Because from the get go she reminded me of Ayla from Chrono Trigger and I've just kinda decided to roll with it. Like how I address Tsukasa as Kraven Spider-Man and now Chrome as Oz. I didn't plan it out or anything it just kinda happened cuz it's fun.      I think I explained this to someone else last week too.
792,"It's hilarious how they are downvoting you just because you are making a joke out of a character's appearance. Like Tsukasa and that guy from Jojo haven't watched Jojo yet, so I don't know his name."
793,Kars
794,"Well I don't know anything about Jojo either. Never watched it, don't care to or want to watch it.      As for the downvoting who knows. When Tsukasa first appeared and I first likened him to Kraven or last week when I likened Kohaku to Ayla people seemed to have no issue with it. But all I can hope to do is speak my piece whether that piece be funny, serious, or philosophical, in this case funny, and hope that I made someone laugh or think."
795,Kohaku’s eyes give me flashbacks...
796,"Of a simpler time. Back in nh college days, good times"

799,"Got super excited when he came to the idea to make antibiotics. I mean thats like late 1800s/early 1900s shit, right? A ""fuck yeah!"" to science!"
800,"Penicillin is also one of those things that's quite easy to make using primitive tools. The more complex step 7 could be avoided if it's to be used directly.    Another related fact I learned recently is that ancient Nerubians, around 0 BC, seems to have been drinking beer containing tetracycline which is one of the most advanced antibiotics we have and it's one of the few still effective against MRSA."
801,"Yeah, the science wasn't in  discovering  penicillin, it was in figuring out how to produce and use it efficiently. It was in saying ""this does a weird thing. . . but  why?"" "
802,So if they have a rule to ban all outside people they must have had some bad incidents in the past          Curious what kinda people are running around out there and what other tribes exist
803,Didn't they specifically say that there are no other people and that everyone outside had been banished?
804,"Okay, so Senkuu seems to think the same way I do. Hundreds of years ago people un-petrified and then these new people we just met are a few generations after that.    The main question is, why don't they know anything about science? The people who did un-petrify awhile back should have known about the old civilization, so why isn't that information passed down.    Also, there was a chance that perhaps some people were never petrified at all and these people were descendants of them. Either way is fine, i just hope they give us a ""canon"" answer on what happened with these people and explain why they have a lack of science or knowledge of the old world.    I actually really like Chrome! Thought he would be annoying, but seems like a good dude who loves science like Senkuu!"
805,"Think about the average person, do they know the underlying mechanics behind every technology they live. Probably not."
806,"True, but you probably would at least past down things like: huge buildings, planes, ways to travel insanely fast.    Judging from Chrome’s reaction, he knew nothing of this sort. So it is a little confusing why they know nothing at all about the old civilization."
807,"Oral knowledge only last so long before being distorted. PLus I'm pretty sure Senku was very thorough when explaining that stuff, while what the others may know from what was passed from generation to generation may not be as clear."
808,"Beyond the fact that oral histories can easily distort, keep in mind that there are probably far more useful pieces of knowledge to pass down to people in this type of world than knowledge about what the world was once like which doesn't really help them much"
809,What chapters did this episode cover
810,Episode ended at the end of chapter 19
811,Pog
812,Ok so I’m not gonna lie I got hella confused watching the start of the episode cause I didn’t realized I didn’t finish the part of episode 6 where he meets the lion girl and ended the episode cause I thought it ended well little did I know there was more plot to it
813,I can say that 2019 is the best year for anime in a while
814,Without that bullshit interaction between the MCs and Tsukasa it is actually a very entertaining show.
816,Everything will be further explained. Either just enjoy the anime or binge the manga in 3 days
817,"2 Is a question that will never be answered. It's a manga and it's focus is on science, not linguistics."
818,"These questions will likely be answered by the end of the season, but not right away."
819,Chrome lost because he didn't have too much RAM
820,And it looks like Senku.exe just overloaded him
821, new character is introduced      name's Chrome     Me: Chrome? Like Google Chrome? Now I wonder where Explorer and Firefox are...
822,"Alexander Fleming: ""That's my boy"""
823,YEAH SCIENCE
824,I can't wait anymore. Someone please tell me which chapter to read from after this episode
825,20
826,Can someone please tell me what chapter this episode is? I want to binge the manga. It's so good.
827,it covered 18 and 19. so start on 20
828,"Yeah, I found out a while back after visiting the Dr. Stone subreddit. Already on chapter 76. Send help."
829,"When I started the manga, I'd read like 7 chapters these that were animated then but after few minutes I was already to chapter 14th. Was this Witchcraft?"
830,The story is really good. I got up to 84 and decided to stop.
831,"Read the whole thing, it's worth it."
832,Look what happens when you let kids drive w/o a license.
833,"Excited to see the explanation for the green light, even it it's a long way off. ""Was it even an attack?"" Makes me think it saved humanity from an extinction event or something. Solar flare maybe?"
834,I thought Chrome was our boy. I was wrong.
835,Senku out here trimming weapons for free without scamming passwords.     Best boy.
836,Kohaku's thighs
837,oh snap more humans. the new crew is pretty hillarious. so senku found himself an assistant in chrome. can't wait for more science!
838,Science beats Sorcery
839,Things are finally ramping up with a flawless episode. Can't wait for next week.
840,That is not the voice I was expecting for Ginro at all.
841,I always get chills from this but today I definitely wish that my memories about this story can be erased so I could feel like the first time again.  It's too good and I can't wait to see more 😭❤️
842,I stopped reading the manga around chapter 60. Does it pick up? I kind of got bored after a while even though I enjoyed it mostly.
843,"Probably not for you, just pass  I'm up to date and it great"
844,those two science bois linking arms and working togther... ITS TOO GODDAMN CUTE
845,"OMG THIS EPISODE WAS AMAZING, BEST ONE YET!! Can't wait to see what happens next! Every inch of willpower I have is going into stopping myself from reading the manga, same with Fruits Basket 2019."
846,"Chrome kinda looks like Taiju , wonder if they're somehow related or something"
847,A WHOLE VILLAGE    WOOO
848," Senku has a science buddy, but mostly a apprentice in the stone world. Chrome was funny to watch when Senku pointed out his tricks. Kohaku showed how much of a lioness she is in this episode. It's going to be interesting of how they make the antibiotic."
849,so it's starting...the prologue finished
850,"I wonder if the people who founded the village were like Tsukasa? Why else wouldn't they passs down at least the knowledge of what  happened to the world, even if they didn't have the know-how to rebuild it?"
851,"Senkuu found himself an apprentice in science. Apart from that, jokes, jokes and more jokes - not all landing by the way."
852,Shows great but the female character designs are so bad. Eff the doujinshi drawings with the terrible eyes and noses
853,Whats up with those eyes
854,When Chrome showed up: oh shit another shounen protagonist! It's always weird to see the typical shounen protagonist from someone else's perspective.
855,Nobody mentioned the monster hunter reference? smh
856,CHROME IS A GOOD BOI.
857,The presence of those people is not well  explained. Are they newly evolved from primates or something??
858,Thank god the story is starting to pick up steam
859,Where can i watch it?
860,Direct link:

863,  Senku   vs   Kohaku   = comedy gold!
864,I’m liking the anime. But I think it’s getting pretty dry. Just everything feels dragged except for the 1 or 2 times there is actual plot points. But other than that I think it’s dope now that senku has an actual person who wants to learn science.
865,"Keep up with it, you won't be disappointed. Things only get better from here on out."
866,"I feel like I’m forcing myself to watch but hopefully. It does. Cause I hate dry, dragging anime’s."
867,It doesn't. It's going to get much better in the next few episodes alone. The village arc is one most of us manga readers all agree is where the real story begins. Everything prior was the prologue.
868,"I've hated this show up until this episode. It feels like its finally hitting its stride, although its still pretty low on my seasonal list. Glad I kept at it though."
869,"Yeah the first arc is by far the worst as Taiju and Yuzuriha are just very bland characters. The new power trio of Senkuu, Chrome and Kohaku are more entertaining before even accounting for side characters"
870,"""Dr. Stone prescribes antibiotics to a patient he hasn't even met.""  Always Sunny Music Plays     Also, this episode made me realize something: Senku has basically done no real science. He's just applying random science facts he remembers. This kid from the village has done more science than him without even knowing it."
871,How do you think he came up with the petrification cure? That was science.
872,"Jesus Christ Marie, they're minerals!"
873,Senku just achivied the stereotype weeabos/nerd dream
874,pretty annoying ep tbh.
876,Well it would be to primitive people who think you're a wacko.
877,What gave you that impression though?
879,"How do you reach that conclusion from that?    Earlier in the episode you get a cart made out of the pulleys used for raising the tree to free Kohaku. It's an indirect result of science used elsewhere.    And remember Senku already knows everything modern. We don't have foresight, when doing basic science we may not know where the results will be. But Senku can skip past that and apply modern knowledge. Of course if someone is sick in a stone age society he would try to develop antibiotics.     Even if you run with the Old Social Contract of Science, that's linear and goes from basic science to applied science, then to engineering and then benefits society, results aren't immediate, but you don't need to rediscover penicillin for every sick patient."
880,Literally says the opposite towards the beginning of the episode.
