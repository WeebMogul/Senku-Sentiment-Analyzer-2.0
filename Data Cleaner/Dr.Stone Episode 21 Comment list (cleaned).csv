1,"Love how you can have fun playing a ""Where's  ""Soyuz"" game"" in most episodes.    He's the one in  ""the boat"" right?"
2,I bet when he formally gets introduced in the second season they'll show some flashbacks to these episodes and they'll point him out in each one
3,Where was he this time
4,  Original comment by ustiveooo | Parent commentranimecommentse02lfbdrstoneepisode21discussionf8bj9a0    ---    In the Manga they skipped the part where all 4 fought vs kohaku to show her 1000 power vs their 500+200+5+1  In the end they said that tsukasa was 5000    ---     This message was posted by a bot because originally submitted  outside of the Source Material Corner. 
5,"All of their power levels were still properly represented in the ""choose your party member"" scene."
6,I just wanna see petrification island animated
7,That will take a while.
8,years
9,I just wanna see Nikki animated. more than the cameo we already got
10,Facts bro
11,"For those wishing to read the source, today's episode covered the entirety of Ch. 54."
12,  Original comment by uArrowThunder | Parent commentranimecommentse02lfbdrstoneepisode21discussionf8d0y9n    ---    They really dig into the mineral scarcity issue in future arcs like where the manga currently is so if we get a second season+ please then you can look forward to it!    ---     This message was posted by a bot because originally submitted  outside of the Source Material Corner. 
13,"Was actually refreshing to see Senku struggle making the vacuum tube, n trying to figure out new solutions. It really made him feel human and not just an encyclopedia churning out 100% accurate info."
14,he still is though. the only reason why he struggled was that the resources are just not there to begin with
15,"I'd say its more like he makes plenty of mistakes, but then he understands why something didn't work from observation, like when the vacuum tubes cracked because the wires expanded. If he was actually perfectly smart then he wouldn't even have attempted doing it that way if he already knew it was going to break."
16,Another great one was when he didn't account for the skyscape changing after so many years. The fact that the author took it into account blew my mind.
17,skyscape? when was that?
18,"Around when he first met Chrome, he was surprised that the North star doesn't point to the true North then he realised why."
19,"Remember when senku had trouble finding the volcanic hot spring?     It’s because the North Star moves, and he didn’t realize that until he eventually met up with Chrome"
20,"Fun fact about that. The North Star becomes more and less ""true north"" on a cycle of about 25,800 years. It'll be about as accurate as it'll ever be in around 2100 AD, and then it'll slowly get worse until the year 15,000 or so, and then it'll start improving again."
21,     Pretty sure there won't be an Earth to worry about this by then
22,"Earth will definitely still be here, us on the other hand..."
23,"False, the Earth is good from anywhere between 1-5B years, depending on who's estimate of what you go by.    Everyone is in agreement that 15,000 years from now the Earth will be here though...like the other guy said...we humans on the other hand aren't as guaranteed."
24,Well he stated that they was no material they could use in the stone world. But it did exist. So it seemed to imply he didn't consider he could make tungsten from the available resources. He probably discarded the option as out of reach erroneously.
25,"To be fair you don't ""make"" tungsten. Its more that he didn't think there would be any around here since it's rare."
26,"Also to be fair it's exceedingly convenient that they did manage to find it somehow, considering this is a world post modern mining, material scarcity should be one of their biggest issues    They'd probably have more luck trying to find a long buried dump or city to recycle metals out of it than find it lying around on the ground. It's probably possible for geological activity in the last 3000 years to deposit some more surface minerals, but most surface minerals were picked clean by various eras long ago    but hey, it's shonen primitive technology, I know that it's bullshit, but I believe it    And that's not even getting into how the entire conflict is flawed because primeape guy could've just went along with senku's plan to revive everyone & just enforce a new world order where everyone starts from scratch, then if they did act like a rich asshole  then  he could kill them, instead of just murdering anyone who wasn't visibly buff or hot enough without questioning them first"
27,"For that matter I doubt wooden gears would work nearly that smoothly. And every time they ""acquire"" something it seems they now have a nigh-infinite supply of it and it never breaks, despite being very crude.     Really, the plot is more meant to illustrate all of these production processes from raw materials to end result. As for the practical aspects... they just work."
28,"It's still an anime, at the end of the day."
29,Taking time showing that they are replacing gears and repairing stuff was probably dropped because they wanted something else shown. But that is the type of thing you can assume is happening without being told. Technical consultants on show are not total incompetents I'm sure. And probably internally frustrated consultants on any show as the drama folks keep dropping the stuff they want to include to make things clearer for something they think will entertain better. And the Drama guys normally do know something about entertainment.
30,"Wooden gears should work smoothly enough, that mainly comes down to the precision they were made with than material choice. They would however need a lot more upkeep than metal ones as they'll wear down a lot faster. For now it's a good enough solution though."
32,"Do they ever go into cities and stuff? It really bugs me that they haven't found any substantial ruins. Even with how long it's been, there would still be tonnes of stuff around."
33,"It kinda bugged me in the beginning, but I think we can read between the lines that there won't be any scavenging, that the old world is gone and this story is about building a new one from scratch. Especially when they run into the Buddha statue and make a point of not using it for materials."
35,"Right, and I figure that's why the story takes place many thousands of years later. So that the author can argue that all structures and items have eroded away completely."
36,"I mean, we saw the cities just fucking rust and fall apart. Even a lot of plastics would be gone and what would remain would most likely be washed away by rains, be lostmoved due to natural catastrophes which are not that uncommon in Japan etc. They'd have more luck finding ruins somewhere really dry in the middle of the continent but a lot would change in 3k+ years"
37,"Pyramids, coliseum?"
38,"No, there really wouldn't be. Modern buildings aren't built to withstand the test of time without constant human supervision. Concrete buildings start to decay after 60 to 250 years WITH human supervision, and that pace might accelerate given storms and other hazards. After 3700 years there'd be nothing left."
39,"We find pottery and stuff from ancient South American and Asian civilizations all the time from nearly that far back. There would definitely still be a lot of stuff left. It wouldn't be in good shape, but that doesn't matter when you just need it for the materials."
40,"Well, there’s supposedly a massive Amazonian city hidden in the Amazon that was lost in a matter of like 6-700 years. That’s a bit of a conspiracy theory though iirc."
41,"Not really, but because more efficient avenues of material acquisition are requiredopen up to them. The notion of scavenging for stuff is complicated because the land has shifted, distances are hard to cover on foot, and by now most of the ruins are likely buriedblended into the landscape. It's just too time-intensive and unreliable for their needs. So far, whenever scavenging would still likely be the most reliable method for acquiring a material like in the case of tungsten, luckplot has provided itan avenue to it that is more appealing like in the case of tungsten."

43,"To be very fair though, Japan might just be an ideal place for rare material gathering since the islands have a few reasonably active volcanos that would actually produce a wide variety of materials every time they erupted...."
44,"Huh, never thought about the geography being a factor."
45,"Yeah, i mean, a lot of geology research takes place in seismically active locations near fault lines, so Japan's volanoes may really have resupplied the land in the area with rare minerals like tungsten especially without humans constantly mining the area dry"
46,"Really? that's like top 5, like the bronze age took so long to get to because tin is actually reasonably rare"
47,"The lack of cities is a bit weird. It seems like he's moved over the millenia, but he can't have gone that far given his classmates are in the same area. There would be a shit-load of stuff you could heist from a city even after thousands of years. All but the most robust stone building will have long collapsed, but stuff like golddiamond jewellery and plastics would be more or less completely intact. Metal things would probably have oxidised but they would be a great source of minerals rather than having to find random rocks. You'd probably have to do a bit of digging, but a lot of the wreckage of larger buildings would still probably be above ground."
48,"That actually does make sense. Modern buildings are surprisingly weak compared to ancient structures like ancient roman buildings, mainly the rebar inside concrete corrodes & shrinks, cracking the concrete & requiring repairsas opposed to roman concrete which has micro-crystals which stop crack propagation. Like, modern buildings are all well and good, but only with regular maintenance, like the golden gate bridge can only stay standing because it's literally never stopped being painted  Plus, ancient cities ended up as archaeological sites now within the 4k years that passed in DrStone. So yes I'm not surprised about the lack of cities, but at the same time there should still be evidence of buildings, the cities should still exist as resources, and it should be vastly better to simply find a garbage dump than go spelunking to find materials. Though that said, what a dump would look like after 4k years is another story, it could be like the sulfuric acid pools with all the methane, etc"
49,"Yeah as I said all but the most robust stone building would have long collapsed, but there would still be some signs of a city being there. Bitumen from roads, glass from windows, thousands of tons of plastic and other non biodegradable things don't just disappear. And even if much of the metal will have corroded, large objects like girders, lamposts and so forth would still be there - if cast iron can still be found from thousands of years ago, massive lumps of corrosion-resistant metal alloys would definitely remain. There should be remains absolutely everywhere and yet there seem no signs at all of civilisation.     They shouldn't have to dig much either because they weren't buried so there clearly wasn't much deposition going on in that area."
50,"From what I could find on the internet, tungsten is quite rare in Japan. There is so little that Japan is not even listed as a producer anywhere I could find. Wikipedia lists 10 mines in Japan that extract tungsten, but most of them shut down years and years ago."
51,"or just script, which is not so bad, because the plot is still great to watch"
52,"No, he still struggled because he doesn't know all the small manufacturing details of everything. Like the base breaking so having to change the design to the hollow tube."
53,I dont get it why he still doesnt start reviving people to help him. With modern people knowledge they they speed up everything. Who knows maybe they could get lucky and get someone expert in something.
54,He needs the liquid from bat caves which is currently guarded by the tarzan guy
55,They are going in caves next episode I am sure they can find bats there.
56,"Thats what I’m hoping, but I would rather not and just focus on his current plan"
57,Not necessarily this cave might not be bat friendly at least at the entrance village side. Not all caves have bats.
58,"The amount of balance in this series is admirable. They developed a great team of characters with supporting strengths and weaknesses and even the super smart and hero main character, can't achieve his goals without the support of those around him.      This is an element missing in many franchises."
59,"ikr, everything went semi-smoothly or smoothly but he struggled so bad with the vacuum tube it made him more human :3"
60,"When they showed Santa during that one scene all I could think about was.....    Dude went from several billion deliveries to under 100. Can we have a ""Santa during a major extinction event"" anime? Basically Death Strandinghaven't played it, going off trailers, but with presents."
61,Santa probably survived the petrification because he was flying on his sled when it happened.
62,Or he's not a human or a swallow.
63,Santa old boss. After all he got the elven ears and is skilled at crafting toys for good people.     bigshock
64,I 1 Billion %  buy into this fan theory.
65,An elf?
66,Or he was in space
67,Maybe he accidentally caused the petrification.
68,He's also magic so he probably flew up when he felt children were vanishing from earth.
69,Santa when the petrification happened : Stonks!
70,"     I'm Free!     The curse is over, I can live my own life now!    No more rushing over the planet for these damn humans and their gifts         Fuck"
71,      sweats 
72,Chrome is ready with the ladder
73,"'Santa, all mankind turned to stone!'     ;     'how how how?' "
74,Maybe he was responsible. He petrified humanity because he was burnt out and wanted a lighter workload.
75,"I imagined him sitting around for 3000 years wondering why the list of kids was so small.    “Huh, do people just not celebrate Christmas anymore?”"
76,Dave Chappelle voice: santa fuckin did that shit
77,           Sign me the fuck up.
78,On Christmas day Senku made light for the people then he get rewarded with Tungsten on New years damn thats some good karma for Senku.
79,Senku the type of guy who might actually like coal in his stocking for its usefulness.
80,and would use the stocking somehow
81,Don't tell me you guys don't use the stocking for... umm... stuff
82,I use jar
83,I use coconut
84,You sick fuck. I like you
85,Hope you didn't forget the MLP figure.
86,... jar binks
87,Ahh yes this delightful Reddit yarn.
88,I am thinking of using stocking and coal to filter water
89,"Senku caring about Christmas is really just a great bit if continuity, since his love of science was kick started when Byakuya bought him his first scientific tools all those centuries ago for Christmas. Really love how coyly he tried to play it off. And with suikas accidental discovery of tungsten, the kingdom of science now has a way to truly make their cell phones. Plus, we finally get to see magma be useful, instead of, you know, a murdering asshole."
90,It's cute that you think he won't try to murder them in the cave and become village leader.
91,"I think magma might not like them, but he realizes life is better under senku. Think about it, he really liked his katana"
92,"Yeah, but there's no way he touches Senku or anyone else while Kohaku is around. Hell Kinro beats him in battle now with glasses. But he's been shown to be a schemer and devious and this is a perfect opportunity for him to take control forcefully and he's too dumb to know how much of a threat Tsukasa is."
93,"Yeah, but if Senku just happens to die in the cave, the villagers would immediately know it was Magma's fault. Pretty much every villager except Magma and his one goon are shown to like having Senku as their chief, so they would almost certainly killexile Magma if they thought he killed him"
94,"I don't think he's too dumb to know how much of a threat Tsukasa is. Wasn't he aware of just how much of a monster Hyoga is in their battle? He's a muscle head, but he knows raw strength and fighting ability when he sees it."
95,"I dunno, I think he really actually does see and like the improvements senku's brought    Like at the start magma was just an angry loud asshole who always looked angry or scheming    Now, at the beginning of senku's work schedule we see him perhaps upset at the change, but eventually he changes to have a sort of stoic expression, like not quite satisfaction but nearly there    I think he actually really likes having something directed to do with his time where he feels like he's actually helping & improving something.     Calling it now, something happens in the cave & magma risks his life for them"
96,"     That would be very Shonen, but also very cool. I'm down."
97,"They spent the whole episode showing Magma being unhappy.  They're definitely setting up the possibility of a betrayal.    Of course, it would be a dumb decision since he's never going to be on top in Tuskasa's world either. Plus no cotton candy."
98,"I agree, I think this is going to be the opportunity for Magma’s redemption so the viewers can start enjoying Magma and wanting to see more later."
99,"I like magma. He basically just does what he wants. And after losing, he's mostly just gone withthe flow, but hes a lovable asshole"
100,"I get the feeling Senku is using this as a test of character. As of now, Magma is  the  most dangerous and unpredictable element within the Kingdom of Science, so Senku might be baiting him into showing his true colors, and I'm certain he's got something up his sleeve to turn Magma around.    That, or, he might just be planning to cut out the unknown variable entirely by kicking Magma down a crevace. This is  Senku,  we're talking about here.    Edit:    THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP IS A BEAUTIFUL THING   "
101,"Senku explicitly wants everyone to survive though, so he wouldn't be kicking anyone down a crevasse."
102,"Whoa there, Magma may be an asshole but he's not George Washington."
103,"I'm confused by your reference? George Washington was a revolutionary, but he wasn't the reason for the revolution."
104,"The famous painting of Washington crossing the Delaware was a depiction of a sneak attack on the Hessians across the river on Christmas morning. Basically he thought it would be tactically advantageous to kill the enemy in their sleep on the most revered holiday, which it was. It was still a dick move, though."
105,Yeah but they were already at war by that point lol    The only real rule in war is that there are no rules
106,I think they are going to play this as a goofy plan to win Magma over.
107,"Gen being around is a great way to show off how actually kind Senku is deep down. First by not bringing up that he was making cola and then surprising Gen, now this with the Christmas lights. Gen can see straight through Senku now, and it's just such a wholesome duo which I hadn't expected when I first saw Gen in the first OP."
108,"Honestly, gen being around balances the cast incredibly well. Since he is from the pre stone world, he has a basic knowledge of everything senku is making, which really takes the magic out of the science, in a good way. He balances the world out, instead of just the villagers, who are all just seeing these things for the first time."
109,Plus him having a basic understanding like the audience makes for a good excuse for explanations.
110,"Hu hu hu, now let's forget that Christmas in Japan is traditionally a couples' holiday..."
111,"Just caught up. Also loving Gen reactions as they've been matching mine. ""We're making cellphones"" excuse me WHAT. Tbh I thought it might have been radio but nah these guys are going straight to vacuum tubes."
112,theres a scene of him looking at an old couple enjoying the ramen. Maybe it would soften him up a bit
113,"Haha, these were pretty cool but damn Kohaku with twice the Health and Attack of anyone else .-."
114,"The only thing I took away this episode was that hypothetically, suika could 1-v-1 senku and win"
115,Makes sense. Even a child in a primitive society probably has more strength and stamina than a middle-aged adult in the modern era of offices and schools.
116,"According to the days he's been alive, Senku is about 17, so not yet a salaryman"
117,"If I was asked to bet between a 9 year old from a hunter-gatherer or a 17 year old modern day non-athlete, I'd go with the hunter-gatherer."
118,"lol, nah, that's silly. Any difference in gathering isn't going to make up the massive differences in strength caused by proper nutrition and being an almost adult male."
119,"Whenever I see Magma I'm always wondering how the fuck he's so stacked. They said themselves that they don't get meat during the winter until Senku shows up, and having a body like Magma's takes a lot of protein."
120,"I mean, the show has clearly taken some liberties with realism, which is totally fine. I'm fine with Suika being stronger than Senku; it just wouldn't happen in real life."
121,"I mean, same, just pointing out Senkuu is still a teenager. An anime teenager, but still a teenager."
122,But you know who also is a Teenager?       Tsukasa.
123,Anime teenager. :p
124,"Of you read ""an edible history of humanity,"" the hunter gatherer enjoys a 2 day work week and 5 day weekend. At least pre agriculture, which we can assume this is.    So I guess it matters on the hobby. They had a lot more time to pursue interests, there was a massive amount of available food compared to after the population boom."
125,"I just like that everyone in that stats list, and probably almost everyone currently in the stone world, could beat up Senku and win."
126,"Is it me, or did it look like a Jump Force parody?"
127,havent played it but from your pic yeah honestly looks super similar and wouldnt surprise me at all with how the show has referenced other games like monster hunter
128,Yeah after seeing that picture there's no doubt
129,Well the manga is serialized in Shounen Jump.
130,"""Friendship!  Hard work!  Victory!"" on Ginro's screen is the motto for Shounen Jump."
131,Whoever suggested that reference really wanted Senku to be in Jump Force lol
132,Tsukasa be like
133,Tsukasa is basically Lubu from dynasty warriors
134,Super basic
135,Suika having 3 attack compared with Senku with 1 attack. Puppy mustve added an additional 2 for Suika
136,"she just rolls really fast at the opponent, and lets the momentum do the heavy hitting"
137,"""Suika used ROLLOUT!"""
138,Finally a worthy opponent to Miltank
139,Goldenrod Gym was where boys became men.
140,Jigglypuff?
141,"She just uses stealth, crawls from the back, catches the enemy in a headlock and then says ""Spit it out!""    urobbyrobbyrobbyreset"
142,Plus that stealth skill
143,Senko did win the Grand Bout though.
144,Gorilla stats
145,Dr. Stone turned into a versus fighting for a second.
146,"I'm curious what the arch villian's stats are. I forgot his name, Ima call him Tarzan. Probably double of Kohaku's."
147,His name is Kars
148,Sex: Usekess
149,He's one of those bosses that you just get a ??? or a skull when you try to scan their attack value.
150,You just know he has a second health bar too.
151,Or third lol
152,The scanner breaks.
153,Try quadruple.
154,He one punched a male adult lion...  I think it’s more than 4x
155,In a 4koma it said 5000. 5 times stronger than kohaku
156,I'd pay to play the game TBH
157,Dr. Stone gacha     waah
158,Would whale
159,No pls I already play too much gachas
160,Where all the MUGEN heads at?
161,I'd main Chrome easy.
162,Senku has less attack than Suika.
163,"However, it states she acts first without thinking, so she's an uncontrollable unit that just attacks randomly."
164,A Berzerker class?
165,"Drstone Jumpforce Scene    Lmao they really made an Jump force episode !!, they are really aware of the memes xD, i cant stop laughing"
168,The one for Ginro was the best.
169,"I love how Senku is still excited about little ""unimportant"" things like making cotton candy or celebrating Christmas. Despite his rough exterior and how much he talks about what is ""logical"", he has a wonderful lack of cynicism that I find refreshing."
170,Morale is important to keep your workers in top condition.
171,"Also every single modern convenience and invention he makes makes it more and more likely that more and more of Tsukasa's army will just straight ditch him at the first opportunity as soon as they find out about it.      Like for real, electricity alone would most likely get the majority of people who are not die hard cavemen commies to bail out."
172,"A true Communist is in favor of technological development, comrade!"
173,
174,Senku is the anti-Rick.
175,somebody make that crossover
176,"Rick is way too overpowered, since he has sci-fi levels of tech. Senku is like what Rick would be, if he was constrained to current-level science."
177,"Definitely overpowered, Rick was basically in a Stone World in The Ricks Must Be Crazy and he ended up with a wooden mecha within a few months.    But I mean they don't need to directly face off in a science fight to make it an interesting story. It'd be better as a psychological, idealism vs. cynicism kind of story."
178,"Oh yeah, that would be amazing!"
179,"That actually the biggest part of him I love. He comes off as a 100% rational  logical person but he really is a kind and emotional person at heart. He just has a different way of showing it. Heck, he has saved people numerous times in the show when he never had to. He's truly a good guy."
180,"Fun Fact! Tungsten is a swedish word that means Heavy rocktung = Heavy, Rock=sten scheelite is from the last name of the swede that discovered it - Scheele    BUT in Sweden NO ONE calls Tungsten, Tungsten instead we use the name Wolfram, same as its periodic symbol W74    When I was watching the episode I was like TUNGSTEN WHAT IS THAT ? heavy rock ?!?!!? and then I was like OAAAh oh yeah they mean Wolfram.     I was hoping that someone was gonna leave Tsukasa camp when Senku was holding a freaking Christmas party."
181,"That's pretty cool, so you guys use Wolfram even in compound naming?  Like you don't even call it tungsten carbide? It is Wolfram carbide? What about the oxides then?"
182,Do they use Tungsten alpha for math problems?
183,ahah we use wolfram for math problems as well-
184,I laughed harder than I want to admit
185,Lmaoo
186,"I don't get the joke, can someone enlighten me?"
188,Underrated comment
189,yes kinda - karbid - carbide obviously.
190,"I'm not a Swede but german speaker Which the language is pretty similiar. We say Wolfram carbid, Wolfram oxid. Makes sense to be honest. Same goes with the Sodium Na and Potassium K, which we call ""Natrium"" and ""Kalium"". English has it's Elements names from latin based language which shows how hybride that language is    ""Fun"" fact. It's called Wolfram because in earlier days, it made extraction of other metals way more difficult. The Wolfram ""Ate"" other metals like a hungry Wolf, ""ram"" simply means ""soot"" in old german."
191,"Do you say ferrum, aurum and argentum too?"
192,Aurum is Gold Normally or Not? xD
193,"Yeah,     Au = gold    Ag = silver    Fe = iron"
195,"Your question seems to have way too specific examples, so I'm pretty sure that you already know the answer so why the question at all?  Forgot to mention that I meant ""a lot"" of it's elements but not ""all"".  So here you have my correction"
196,What do you mean way too specific examples? Iron gold and silver were just the first ones I thought of that you didn't mention.    Why would I have any idea which ones you do use the original name for and which ones you don't? I'm not german.    Could you not just answer a regular question like a normal person?
197,"I'm Sorry. I had a really bad day and misunderstood your question.      Ferrum, Aurum and Argentum are latin names. You see that well for example in french Fer, Or, Argent, therefore it would be unlikely that you find them in germanic languages. We call them Eisen, Gold, Silber, which is pretty similiar"
198,"Same in german btw, Wolframkcarbid."
199,Fun thing based off of this: part of the reason Suika takes it with her is because the weight in the manga. So the name heavy rock can be taken quite literal in this sense.
200,"Which technically doesn't make sense since the tungsten compound they found is less dense than even the copper they showed. It only got like 6gcm³. Compare it to other stuff they already have, lead 11, gold 19 the scheelite wouldn't stand out from a regular rockgemstone."
201,"Your not wrong, but we also have to consider the rocks around said location. Gold is obviously rare, and it seems like Chrome was the only one to collect it. Probably the same with copper since its in the native form, plus its naturally distinct appearance. Galena lead, I'm in agreement. All of that plus the standard rock formations appear to be somewhat granite which is actually pretty light."
202,Another Fun Fact     Remember a few episodes ago when we expected him to build nukes?     There is a weapons plan to literally shoot Tungsten rods from Orbit and use the kinetic energy as warhead
203,I think it’s also used in the making of rail gun projectiles.
204,"The old ""Rods From God"" plan. Isn't that literally what was being shown with the image of the tungsten rod superimposed over the sun? I assumed it was an allusion to how this metal is a critical component in their unstoppable superweapon."
205,"Nope, that was an APFSDS projectile, tank munition to basically chew through enemy armour like a hot knife through butter"
206,"Ah, I knew that shape was familiar. I was really into a certain tank game a few years ago and it probably came up during one of the many heated discussions of ammo types."
207,iirc they ditched the plan cause it was too expensive compared to good ol' airburst and nuclear bombs.
208,Yeah I can imagine that     Plus isnt there like a UN conviction that bans such weapon systems from Space?
209,"You really think the superpowers will take that seriously? Atm they already have enough nukes to destroy the earth as we know it, it'd just be overkill."
210,If that was true the Sun would kill us every day as it hits our planet with way more than double the megatons of power of all nuclear bombs we ever had. And Volcano's and asteroids have hit many more time powerful than all the bombs we have.     Actually only enough nukes to mess up Russia and the US. When we had way more bombs during the cold war we could mess up part of Europe too. That kill many times over is a massive lie that keeps being repeated based on math that everyone live in the same place in paper and flimsy wood buildings at the super high population density the Atomic Targets had thanks to tons of refugees from the 100 plus City's the US has already destroyed. Plus the math assumed if you double the amount of explosive you double the radius and thus the deaths when it's a exponential problem.    Anyone in Science knew this and that is why the Nuclear Winter theory was develop which they would have not bothered with if everyone was dead.     Just like Global Warming activists the Atomic foes had to exaggerate to everyone dead instead of hundreds of millions to billions dead with I think is strong enough a problem to want to stop Global Warming or Nuclear War.     With Global Warming the Earth with all the ice melted and all the permafrost melted has happened before and conditions are actually human friendly. It's the horrible disasters and problems caused during a rapid shift that's the problem.
211,Kinetic weapons aren't banned and is totally legal.
212,Even kinetic weapons for bombardment?
213,"It specifically mentions either nuclear and or other weapons of mass destruction. Most of the time it refers to NBC types of weapons, nuclear, chemical or biological.     Bombardment type is a bit fuzzy but a single, highly precise firing of a weapon rod relying on just gravity would be legal probably."
214,Dainsleif
215,"Honor Harrington Sci Fi series in several books that is the standard planetary weapon. They count the yield like Nuclear bombs and can vary the speed the spike hits to change the yield. They are preferred to the anti ship weapons which are atomic bombs of 15 to over 100 megaton pumping X-Ray laser beams of intense power. Not something you shoot at a planet plus the Rods ""blow things up"" just fine.     Love the series, hard sci-fi with tons of pages of how things work so never going to translated to animation or film. Plus ships is space actually having to deal with momentum and the huge ranges can take a great amount of time to do things in battles. Launch your missiles and 20 plus minutes they hit. Turning around for another pass can take the better part of a day depending on how fast the ships are moving. Similar reason Age of Sail cannon battles not often  done. They are great in the Books. But waiting for ships that travel less than 10 knots to maneuver into position can take hours and again after a successful move it can take another hour to come back. Plus cannons don't fire all that fast."
216,"Ah yes, orbital bombardmentRods From God. Though it doesn't involve firing them from orbit, but rather to just make them stop orbiting and then let gravity do the rest. The benefit is that the impact would get you roughly as much force as a nuke but without the long term fallout effect that makes the area unusable for thousands of years. The downside is that it's very technically difficult to make them work, and also very expensive to put giant tungsten rods into orbit."
217,"Additional piece of information: A lot of elements were discovered and thus named by Swedes because they had a good level literacy and good education system so a lot of chemists, both professional and enthusiasts. But also there was a small mine near Stockholm, the Ytterby mine that had a lot of variety in elements."
218,So that's where yttrium's name comes from!
219,"More fun fact: the Ytterby mine gives name to   four   elements: yttrium, ytterbium, erbium and terbium"
220,Chrome would love it
221,"Back when i lived in Argentina, don't know the rest of South America and when i learned the periodic table we called it Wolfram too well, Wolframio in spanish."
222,the name wolfram comes from spanish inventors so I guess the spanish speaking effected countries calls it wolfram
223,I remember tungsten from the my hero character who had the power to make objects big. He was throwing nails at Torodoki that wouldn’t melt
224,DID THIS FUCKING SHOW JUST OFFICIALLY START PADORU SEASON      dekuhype
225,HASHIRE SORI YO
226,KAZE NO YOU NI
227,TSUKIMIHARA WO
228,   PADORU PADORUU  
230,Can someone explain?
231,Hashire sori yo
232,I’m calling it now they’re going to find some of the revival fluid in the caves.
233,Senku’s going to figure that out the second they see bats.
234,maybe they will even find petrified batman deep into the cave
235,Or a petrified Manray!
236,"Who wins: Tsukasa's muscle empire or Batman with 3,700 years of prep time?"
237,Batman is already basically just Senku + Tsukasa
238,"Superman, Goku, and Saitama working together couldn't take Batman with 3,700 years of prep time."
239,Lol
240,That would be way too op.
241,"The preview of the cave literally had bats in it if I remember correctly, sooooooo foreshadowing??"
242,Maybe I'm missing something but wouldn't that just be convenient writing? With such small numbers Senku and the villagers should've just scouted all nearby caves if there was a chance to have their own source of revival fluid.
243,Not all caves have bats or in this case maybe the bat's live at a entrance to the cave system that is not near the village as a multi entrance cave normally does not have bats at all entrances.
244,"Mate... You just watched this episode, thought it was fine, but then think that is just convenient writing?    The whole tungsten thing was completely contrived."
245,Not even Tsukasa can evade a musket ball.
246,"I mean the best way to avoid a musket ball is just to be a moderate distance away. There's a reason they were fired in volleys, they were actually less accurate than bows. Muskets only became popular because it was much easier to hand any villager a musket and tell them to point it in the right direction than to teach them to use a bow properly. So training time was drastically reduced and your potential army size increased, but that requires enough people to form an army.    Now if Senku comes up with rifling and cartridges for a bolt action rifle or at least something like a shotgun, that would be dangerous. Even if Senku had muskets the utility would still be mostly the intimidation factor. Honestly a shotgun would probably be my go to, it doesn't have the range of a rifle but it has that 'just aim it vaguely over there' quality and destructive power to it without being complicated to construct or requiring much training. It also has a good amount of flexibility depending on what you load it with."
247,"My knowledge of muskets and well all weapons is from media. That being said, the blunderbuss is always treated like a shotgun. Would that be effectiveefficient or is straight into something like a WW1 trenchgun better for the effort  Edit: Afterthat wouldnt a flintlock pistol suffice too?  Edit 2: Im stupid i was being shown a pistol variant blunderbuss."
248,"A blunderbuss is similar to a shotgun but loaded like a musket. Having to stop, pour powder and pack the paper and ammo in and then hope it ignites, is a real killer when it comes to rate of fire, efficiency, and places where things could go wrong.    Honestly the key is making cartridgesshells more than anything else, it reduces a lot of complications, speeds reloadfiring time, and helps protect against things like weather. Honestly I'm not sure how complicated the internals of something like a pump action trench gun are but I'd bet on even a simple double barreled shotgun with shells over any kind of muzzleloader.    Honestly I'm not super into the internals of different guns, I just generally know the history of why one type replaced the other. Maybe someone better versed in firearms could add more."
249,"you're forgetting one specifc and important invention, which is as important  as cartridge, the smokeless black powder, permitting more secure and constant firearms. :3"
250,"Don't forget the primer.  Most primers require Nitric acid to make, and unless Senkuu comes up with a new way to make Nitric acid which Tsukasa controls all of currently then they wouldn't be able to make use of cartridges."
251,Going from a muzzleloader to a breechloader might be enough.
252,a simple breech loading rifle and you are well on your way to effective weapons
253,The intimidation factor was a big part of Drifters and it made guns seem ever more OP.
254,Yes because they were used in formation by a General Famous for training his troops to volley fire.
255,     Exactly. Keep retreating until you can't do so anymore and Tsukasa's people surrender.
256,     That sounds like exactly what he's got to work with.  No reason he couldn't arm the entire village with muskets.
257,Except no Gunpowder. And that is a lot of Iron don't think they have enough yet.
258,"Speaking of bows, kinda surprised they didn't go for crossbows? Easy to train like a musket honestly. You can even make simple sights on them for estimating distance if you really want."
259,"You wouldn't even need rifling, just contruct bullets with fins to stabilize flight."
260,Knowing anime logic I wouldn't be so sure. The dude fought against lions bare handed and won.
261,"Definitely, we're going to need some unnamed NPCs to die in the Stone Wars."
262,"Oh, we have found another source of the revival fluid. But who should we revive first?     ;    Hey, how about this bunch of statues who are all wearing red shirts for some reason?"
263,thats why magma will be there
264,Senku's failure to make revival fluid is starting to irk me.  It's not like there aren't other bat colonies or even other ways to get nitric acid.  Plus he has sulfuric acid anyway.  It seems like if he wanted to he could be reviving people.
265,"He has talked about the other ways of getting nitric acid but dismissed them because return of investment is absolutely dismal and it'd take them way to long to get enough for even one person. Another way'd be to induce a chemical reaction using platinum, but good fucking luck finding platinum at all, let alone in Japan.    Also, the issue isn't that there aren't any caves with bats around, but rather that the conditions for bat guano to naturally turn into nitric acid are hyper specific and you need certain microorganisms that decompose the guano. I believe the cave is directly styled after a cave in Borneo and IIRC there's only a handful of caves in the entire world that fit the profile at all. Looking for another cave like that would be a crapshoot and even harder than getting platinum. Them finding that cave in the first place really was a miracle."
266,"I cant wait to see the interaction between Magma, Senku and Chrome alone in cave."
267,I'm surprise they trust Magma enough to go into the caves with him.
268,"I mean, they are kinda on the same team right now. What is he going to do? Kill their villages biggest hopes of survival?"
269,Magma isn't the brightest and seems like the type of guy to hold grudges. Didn't he also try to kill Gen on the spot?
270,"You are right, he could be dumb enough to do that lmao"
271,"That one was at least understandable, he legit thought Gen was a traitor to the village in that moment.    If we're gonna hate Magma for anything it would be how he had plans to eliminate Ruri if he were to be village chief, that shit be evil, but wanting to kill what he thought was a traitor? Not so evil."
272,"Yeah, I wish Magma's character was a bit different. Have him be an ""ends justify the means"" character, who honestly believed that he was the village's best hope for survival. Then have he realize that Senku really does just want to improve everyone's lives and have him warm up to Senku make him a tsundere."
273,"Beefdere    It's not like I'm jacked for your sake or anything, baka."
274,"He didn't try to kill him because he thought he was a traitor, he tried to kill him because he thought he was Senku the sorcerer. It was about eliminating a strong threat to himself."
275,"This.    Basically, Magma is self serving and will act accordingly. So if he needs Senku alive he will keep him alive, but if he doesn't..."
276,"Well, it's p obvious that they all need him alive. If Senku & Chrome mysteriously died in the cave, do you think anyone would believe that it was an accident?"
277,"He isn't a complete idiot. He still has some todies in the village. He would get them to rally around him, and he would come back with some ""evidence"" that showed they fell or something, and the todies would back up his claim.    People who were on Team Senku before the battle to choose the new leader wouldn't believe it, but others would eventually forget about it and just enjoy the stuff Senku invented for them."
278,That they couldn't keep producing without Senku & Chrome
279,"They couldn't make new inventions without Senku and Chrome. They were so happy with the water wheel, I think they would be content with that. They don't know of all the other things that Senku could help them invent."
280,"Due to some reason, I have a feeling that they will finally bond after the cave adventure."
281,Maybe the classic good guys are in trouble and the bad guy reedeems himself by saving them situation.
282,"If Senku and maybe Chrome die, Tsukasa's little goon squad will have no reason to attack the village."
283,I could see senku and chrome talking super sciency around him then magma thinking there talking down at him and get angry
284,"There wouldn't be a war without Senku. And you know, lots of accidents happen in caves."
285,Seems like the perfect opportunity for magma's character building
286,I do love a good redemption arc.
287,I don't think senkuu actually views him as a threat. Either knows he won't do anything seriously stupid or that he can outsmart Magma if he does try something stupid.
288,"The way I see it, this is going to be a turning point for Magma, either he'll be won over during their adventures and be Senkus man afterwards, or he'll try and betray them."
289,"This is all part of the plan. He knows he needs to build trust with Magma before he decides to defect with Tsukasa, because he has shown to be not very loyal to the village."
290,I'm 100% expecting it to be some ploy to win Magma over.
291,Sounds like a doujin waiting to happen.
292,Well Magma has the right  goods  ;
293,   Stitches!      Chrome      Kaseki      Senku      Village Girls      Christmas Tree      Kohaku & Ruri Grape Stomping    Didn't expect the battery to be finished that quick!    I love everyone celebrating that they don't have to pump air into the furnace anymore xD    Kohaku and Ruri grape stomping tho... They didn't really have to be wrapped in towels for that but I thank whoever decided that. Also we need more twintails Ruri!    We finally got another scene in the OP! Nice of Senku to time this on Christmas Eve.    Santa why the fuck aren't you petrified!?     I think this is the first time we've seen Senku actually give up.     Thank goodness Suika is here to save the day with the rock that she found!    I     Magma for the exploration party? I guess this is where we'll finally see if he's really with the Kingdom of Science or will he become a backstabbing traitor. Please prove me wrong Magma.
294,Secret technique: let someone else do it!   hahahha
295,And the very next one is running away
296,"Not even Magma is stupid enough to try his luck with Tsukasa. He's an adult, he'll get fucked."
297,"He doesn't really have to go to Tsukasa to betray them. What I had in mind is him still holding a grudge from his loss back in the tournament, he might end up trying to get some payback when it's just the three of them exploring the caves."
298,Kills Senku. Returns to village. Executed for murdering the village chief.
299,Magma: Surprised Pikachu face.
300,And he'll get reminded that there's more of where that spear guy came from and he has no chance to survive if he backstabs Senku.
301,Is Magma an adult and not just a carrier of those monster 14 yr old barbarian genes?
302,"Tsukasa doesn't hate adults, he just hates ""old"" people that he sees as too stuck in their ways for him to change or convince, e.g. the equivalency of Gen X and above."
303,"A idea that comes up every so often in human history. Last time was with the Hippies of the Baby Boomers with the saying ""Don't trust anyone over thirty""    It's a theory already disproved by street gangs the young are actually more likely to war than the old. Tribes all over the world often had problems keeping the peace as young warriors often launched attacks without permission.     It's just because the bad decisions are made by the old because they had earned the right to be in charge that forms this idea.     The young's advantage and disadvantage it willingness to try something new and push hard. Sometimes it works wonderful and sometimes it results in disaster and oppression.    I do think Tsukasa is following normal Warlord or Dictator course. They are abused by something and want to fix it when young but it shifts to just the excuse they use to put themselves in power and keep solo control which becomes their actual goal."
304,"Batteries and capacitors are actually fairly easy to stumble across. Potato batteries are a good example of how ridiculously simple it is to get electrons to flow from copper to zinc. Senku's sulfuric acid galvanic cells are going to be on the order of automotive batteries in the amount of power they can store.    Capacitors are likewise pretty darn easy, even for stone-age folks. Static sparks from wool or cat fur is basically all the inspiration you need for very basic capacitors. With his hobby of collecting interesting materials, it's surprising that Chrome hasn't already stumbled across it.    There is some speculation that the details of the 'Ark of the Convenant' given in certain scriptures describes a wood-air-gold capacitor. We actually still use paper-aluminum-air capacitors in some low-precision and 'disposable' electronics, although most of our capacitors are made primarily from ceramic or plastic in the modern era."
305,got a stitch of the tree? thanks
306,You mean this
307,Both! Thanks!
308,The grape stomping you posted is unstitched if that was accidental.
309,Yep it's a gfycat link intentionally. Too much movement from the twins to make a decent stitch.    edit: Nice I'm being downvoted because I missed one stitch. Oh reddit.
310,"It took me a over an hour, but I did it. Not sure it was worth it"
311,Totally worth it
312,I think that character select screen is the same one from Jump Force
313,Woah... that Christmas tree picture looks so beautiful.    And there wasn't much he could do without Tungsten; finding it as it is is a miracle.
314,Kohaku looks so happy stomping grapes!
315,"Is it just me, or is the bit of fabric at the crotch moving oddly?"
316,"The character select thing was a reference to Jump Force, the fighting game of all the Shonen Jump series"
317,Kohaku’s winter outfit is    C U T E       A F
318,you mean the smol Suika
319,We were watching a Christmas special this whole time and didn't even realize it.
320,We've been bamboozled!
321,I want some of that wine.
322,Gamer Girl Wine
323,Just take my money.
324,Your order's on the way. Payment will be made with mineral ores.     bacchiri
325,lol ruri has chicken legs
326,Of course. She spent most of her life unable to exercise.
327,Megadoomer GIR!
328,Ooh dear look at the time 3am all ready
329,Knew I'd find this in this thread. Thank you friend.
330,"I am sure people laugh now, but watch this become a thing."
331,It's a thing already. It's called vino patero.
332,Sounds Italian
333,"There is a famous clip of a fox reporter trying to do this.    ""Grape lady"""
334,It's literally a thing since forever
335,Most of the people that would buy it aren't old enough to drink.
336,I'LL TAKE TEN!!!
337,I will take your entire stock
338,i wanna be those grapes
339,Found Mineta.
340,Check out some natural wine makers! That’s basically all it is
342,"No, it is a tourist attraction thing but it was actually widely used. It just got obsolete the moment industrial methods were introduced. And well, since they didn't really have time to spend on re-inventing that contraption:    Feet it is"
344,Press X to doubt
345,uForcedSexWithPlants  hmmmm
347,     :|
348,Even the wikipedia article you linked states otherwise.
350,   Literally the first picture in your wiki article mentions human feet to be the first press.
351,"     These people had literally never seen a gear. A crank press is far beyond their technological level, and the science team was busy doing more important stuff."
352,"Okay, so it’s a myth      are astronauts going to really know how to do this via press or will they go with the foot stomp wine  trope?"
353,but is it as good as having ladies stomping on grapes?
354,"Hardly, that wine is already  godly material        ero"
355,Maybe that myth was the same one that went through the ages in the village. It's possible that Senku wasn't even involved in what we saw.
356,Look it up on Wikipedia foot stomping has been used for thousands of years.
357,"Well, i imagine in the past even villagerspeople tasked with making wine and such eventually got machinery to put it in a way to facilitate and improve the making of it, like rudimentary presses as you say.    But fact still is, i would like some of that wine."
358,Not a myth take a moment to check Wikipedia.
359,"Great Episode!    Also, now when Chrome get's his own ideas he can have a lightbulb instead of just the filiment."
360,Suika All praise the mighty melon!     utahapraises
361,"Mandatory Suikan ""Kept you waiting, huh?"""
362,"She was so cute and adorable, her VA is perfect"
363,"Making the battery looks so simple    I love all the different faces, but Kohaku's the best    Suika looks extra adorable here    Like father like daughter    Thanks to Senku's arrival, everyone in the village feels reinvigorated. Their lives now have a bigger purpose than just living and fishing.    HUZZAH    The trees look very pretty    Frost is covering everything, Winter is approaching    We've got winter outfits!    This is basically the same shot from the Opening, but it's still really pretty    Wtf    &nbsp;       Is Kaseki a masochist?    Well crud. Senku has actually hit a major roadblock and he doesn't know what to do. There's nothing that can stand up the heat of the wiring.    Wakey-wakey    I have never heard of Scheelite before. But now Senku has a way of containing the heat: Tungsten!    I love this character select screen    Time to prove your worth Magma!"
364,            Everyone has a coat and a scarf on while Kaseki is still running around shirtless 
365,     Never underestimate dwarven constitution.
366,Or the heat from a forgefurnace. I’m sure he is nice and toasty
367,All that crafting has him fired up.
368,Six pack   
369,Sauce?
370,Shinchou Yuusha. It's airing this season
371,"He had his own coat but when he heard about vacuum tubes, he ripped it to the pieces from excitement."
372,Guy goes through more clothes than the Hulk
373,Next up they need to invent elastic.
374,How’s Tsukasa handling their first winter?...
375,Not to mention Kohaku going pantsless
376,And Kohaku still can't be bothered to wear pants. It's below freezing. You need more than just a coat.
377,     She looks like testicles to me but whatever floats your boat
378,"Nah, more like this."
379,"Lol, yeah, I see it.    But to me, she looke like an upside-down slime knight."
380,Suika is just the cutest thing ever.
381,"Santa-san. For christmas this year, pls give us guns so we can murder Tsukasa.    Amen..?"
382,"I'd rather have his sled, I mean it's a flying machine with perpetual energy."
383,It can also exceed light speed given the number of deliveries made in a single night.
384,Damn. Now i want it
385,making a list and checking it twice
386,Latom
387,"If senku wanted to he could've just spent the last few months mass producing Gunpowder, refining it and making proper guns. But he wants a less violent approach.    E: Wow you were quick to jump on the downvotes huh,"
388,"They don't have access to the cave, so no gunpowder."
389,"They have carbon from the charcoal, sulfur from the mountain, and a village to literally shit out the nitrates for the saltpeter. Sure guano is less labor intensive but it's not exactly required."
390,"Thank you... Not sure why people rushed to down-vote me, we're all watching the same show..."
391,"Beats me, you are totally right. Winning without killing is central to his entire philosophical argument with Tsukasa. With the materials he has access to and his knowledge he could make weapons the likes of which would make a gun seem trivial."
392,"Yes because that one single cave in the entire region is the only supply of Nitric acid, there's totally no where else they could go to get it."
393,No where it was naturally produced and he calculated anything he could work up would not be ready in time.     Then you need the iron.     And the guns he will have will be the very slow to reload fuse ignite with long matches hand cannon types probably. They have no one who has actually built a black powder weapon and the fine metal work that goes into the firing mechanism. The ratio of the barrel to firing chamber and lots of other things go into making a good gun and they lack the knowlage.  It could take years to get the right sizes of everything to get to later period wheel or flint locks. And tons of time gun manufacture of muskets was a slow process done by specialists.     And then you need to train to volley fire. And it actually will boil down to how good they are with bayonets vs enemy spears as that is how musket battles worked.     Study actual use in battle it would only stop enemy if their moral is poor so they run otherwise things go hand to hand.     And if they figure out they have firearms they will wait for rain then they are screwed.
394,"I mean, if he really wanted to go to the extreme he could've probably already mass-made chemical weapons and wipe out Tsukasa's entire camp"
395,There is no UN to nag their fingers for breaking the Geneva Conventions. Bring on the sulphuric acid.
396,"Or mustard gas, the worst chemical weapon from the great war is remarkably easy to make. That's why people keep accidentally mustard gasing themselves"
397,"But how do you collect, carry and deploy that much mustard. That stuff is nasty and hard to handle and delivered in artillery shells that explode. And it's not going to take out all of them. It's more a terror weapon than a mass killer. It creates horrible wounds and blinds but not near everyone gets exposed. You need the more effective on humans chemical weapons for higher death tolls. Chemical Weapons were not easy to deploy in WWI and their were causalities in those firing them from the chemicals.     Greek Fire is more realistic."
398,"Mustard gas can be premixed with how intricate the glass work has been so far. So you just throw a jar where the wind will carry it to them and not you. It also settles low so the cave is probably at a lower elevation than a few points. While it was deployed by shelling, it's a gas, it can be deployed by anything. Like I said, people mustard gas their entire apartment complexes by accident and it's why you should always have a neutralizer on hand anytime you clean"
399,"     I would say the same for Tsukasa, the acrobatic girl or the skilled dude could sabotage the village or energy generator at any time until the all-out attack after winter.    It's just that this anime has nothing to do with pure violence, death and gore. Even the blood was fake when Gen was stabbed."
400,They have no idea what the energy generator does to make it priority target.     They have already pulled a sneak attack into the village it's unlikely to work twice with village warned and not having a succession battle.     A immediate attack I believe would have been better chance but probably would have ended with the villagers on the Islands and siege they could not maintain. But an attempt should have been made but with the iron vs rock problem no sure win with less people. An attempt at raid not a bad idea but Tsukasa is not actually mentioned as military expert and this is a believable third world plan of overwhelm in the Spring and not risk losing folk in a failed early attack.
401,This series has alot of montages with good ost
402,THIS. The ost is so damn good and makes you just FEEL the mood.
403,Gen: Illumination!    Subtitles: Decorative lighting!
404,"Subs are right, actually. It's one of those english words used in japanese with a different meaning."
405,"Interesting, good to know!"
406,Like bitch meaning slut
407,Japanese sure has a lot of those. Makes things a bit confusing.
408,"It's the same as ""anime"", ""hentai"", ""doujin"" they're all used incorrectly.    Anime = animation, not japanese animation    Hentai = pervert, not japanese drawn porn    Doujin = self published work, essentially ""indie"", not just porn comics"
409,"Well, to be fair, English has a lot of them too. I mean, we pick up words in other languages all the time and give them whatever meaning we first see that thing in."
410,"Ah, true. I guess it's just more obvious when you know the original meaning."
411,"Are you forgetting the ""special relationship"" English and French share?"
412,Same for Kanji in Japanese. The meaning can get very diverged from the original meaning.
413,"Fun fact: a ""mansion"" in Japanese is a condominium."
414,"And a ""condominium"" in English seems to be a block of flats"
415,Would have sucked if that Christmas lighting started an electrical fire and burned down the forest.
416,Cue Gen trying to convince the villagers it was Homura so they don't kill Senkuu
417,That looked like some fine wine making.
418,Yeah but wearing white!? Think of the stains.
419,What if the plan is making the clothes purpleblue to begin with
420,Multitasking
421,"Damn he going to used Magma? I mean I know that he is useful for his raw power but I would not trust him for a second, especially in a cave. I can totally see him using that chance to kill Chrome and Senku, I mean that probably won't happen but it is entirely possible."
422,He saw how outrageously strong the spear guy was and he's coming with an army. The only chance to survive and have anything to rule over in the future is to help Senku save the village.
423,I think that Tsukusa would actually let Magma join them and I also think that Magma would definitely buy into the Tsukasa's idea of ideal world.
424,Magma's too old. Tsukasa will kill him.
425,"Tsukasa's problem isn't with old people, it's with the people who believe in doing things the old way from the old world. The only way to make sure that doesn't happen, in his view, is to kill anyone old enough to have been in charge. Magma isn't from the old world so doesn't have those preconceived notions."
426,And yet he would burn the entire village down with no regard for their safety just out of spite for Senku.
427,"It's not really spite, it's fear. He  knows  Senku can bring back the old world and thinks Senku is the only thing stopping him from creating the world he wants. He's willing to kill anyone he has to to keep that from happening, it's not personal and it really has nothing to do with the village itself. It's all about stopping Senku."
428,"Tsukasa wouldn't burn a village, Homura was acting on Hyuga's orders"
429,He killed people who were old regardless.  It's not like he personally knew of the statued people were going to believe one way or another.
430,"He doesn't know individually but he blames the older generation collectively for the way the world was and believes they would bring things back to the way they were, there was a whole speech about this. He's a sociopath willing to kill anyone in his way, of course he's not conducting interviews."
431,"And this typical of warlords and dictators, the cause becomes secondary and keeping power becomes primary by the time they gain power. These despots often actually seam to believe their causes when young but it does not last as power corrupts and then the cause becomes the propaganda you manipulate with."
432,So we are in agreement
433,"But for what reason the dumb Magma would do that? If the only thing he's going to do with his life is to be the strongest or to be a ruler if anything, he's not going to lick Tsukasa's foot for that, not the guy that burned his village and threatened to destroy it. The guy is pride dumb but not a completely moron."
434,he's like biff tannen now after george knocked him out.
435,"I felt like that was obvious for some reason, glad it went that way too.     Senku absolutely knows that Magma knows killing them would be terrible for him. If he kills either one the village will be against him and the kingdom of Stronk will take over the village anyway so he won't get to be the ruler."
436,"That's probably why he wants to take him, it's risky but right now Magma is the person most likely to betray the village, not to mention he controls a a powerful faction within the village.  My guess is that Senku wants to remove that threat now by bringing him into the fold."
437,"Senku made a Christmas tree. How sentimental of him.      That team member select screen was unexpected and funny. And once the prospect of cave exploration came up there it was pretty clear that he was gonna end up taking Magma. Here's hoping Magma doesn't do something stupid. After all Kraven and his army are gonna be coming whether Senku is there or not and frankly he's not their best chance to beat them, he's their only chance. Just hope Magma is smart enough to know that by now.      But I must say I'm surprised. With the episode being titled ""Spartan Crafts Club"" I figured we were gonna get a little bit of time spent showing what Taiju and Yuzuriha the crafts club girl according to Senku were up to. But oh well, this episode with its low and high moments for Senku was good enough anyways."
438,Given that we eventually see everything in the OP in the show itself it remains to be seen what part Taiju and Yuzuriha will play in this war.
439,Yeah I know but going off title alone I figured we'd be seeing them in  this  episode.
440,they saved the budget for the Hyoga fight for the science episodes
441,Who's Kraven?
442,Tsukasa. When Tsukasa first appeared in his premier episode way back I remarked that he was was basically the Spider-Man villain Kraven the Hunter. And I've been just referring to him as that name since then just for fun as a running joke. Same with referring to Kohaku as Ayla from Chrono Trigger.
443,"Oh my bad, gotcha haha"
444,It's alright. Your not the first one to ask about my out of place naming for some of these characters.
445,Plot twist: Santa-san turned the world to stone so he could take a break for every Christmas.
446,Seems legit.
447,"""I used the stone to destroy the stone"""
448,God I wish those grapes were me.
449,I'm glad to know that santa claus didn't got stonified lol
450,Maybe he was the one responsible for the petrification!?
451,"""I wanted to give them rocks for being naughty, not turn them into rocks, I swear!"""
452,Holy shit. I think you're on to something. He's the main antagonist of mankind. Since he didn't free them nor made any contact with Ishigami Village and bring them alien technology.    Edit: word
453,Some kid wihsed for all the illnesses and wounds of mankind to disappear and Santa tried to but couldn't find a way to revive everyone.
454,WHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHYWHY
455,He was tired of having to deliver so many presents every year.
456,"He actually did. He just kept himself conscious by going over the list, and checking twice. After that all it took was a bunch of reindeer shitting on him. He actually woke up shortly after Senku did."
457,Maybe he's a yokai or something?
458,"Nah, Santa is Odin."
459,Maybe he might be able to lend his security firm Valkyries for the war against Tsukasa
460,The Character select screen made me lose it
461,Factorio: the anime.
462,"It makes sense, Senku wanted to make a rocket after all."
463,Now we just need to wait for him to run around in a mech suit with a flamethrower and destroy tsukasa
464,"Why I like Dr Stone.    That and Boichi's magnificent illustrations, of course."
465,"Yes, that's why I love it so much! Damn it, this is so good, I wish it went on forever."
466,"Why didn't this series come out when I was still in school    Those days, I couldn't even remember a single formula while studying from the book    Now tho, every episode I get to see some science stuff, I have no problem memorizing the stuff     YA BE"
467,Because the show makes learning fun.
468,Schools are learning poison. Unless you win the lottery and get a good teacher you're not going to learn much
469,Yep need Science teachers who make if fun. And in these days of standardized test it seams that is not the point of school right now.
470,"It's amazing how hyped this anime makes me for things we take for granted irl. Getting hydroelectric power is a huge step forward. Love that it was thanks to Chrome and Kaseki.    Aw that's pure, it's Christmas. Not much longer for us either. Nice to see that Santa managed to avoid being petrified.    ""Senku-chan, wakey-wakey!""    Tungsten is the Godzilla of this age."
471,"Love that montage moment of the village preparing for winter with that amazing OST. Excellent ""Select your team"" scene is well done. Goosebumps when the scheelite  started to glow in the morning sun. Excellent Episode overall with bonus grape stomping waifus"
472,We Spelunky now bois
473,Fuck those bats.
474,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't tungsten super rare find in the nature? Like what are the chances they'd find it in a  cave in Japan?"
475,Pretty slim which is why I think Senku didnt even consider it.
476,"It appears in metamorphic veins, typically in the same sort of place as Tin and Topaz.     If humanity wasn't going around mining everything for a few thousand years, some veins would gradually appear from natural causes, but the chances are still rather slim, indeed.    EDIT: Fun fact; Tungsten is 70% heavier than Lead; so Suika hoisting up that chunk of Scheelite probably means she's stronger than she first appears. XD"
477,The wikipedia article says some has been found in japan at least.
478,Her atk stat  is  higher than Senku's
479,chances are its not pure tunngsten also    according to the character select screen she is 3 times stronger then senku
480,There was that Dam flood. And probably other floods as Japan is geologically active place. I wonder over that period of time what happens to the metals in the land fills? Clump and get deposited.  Oh even better all these rocks are actually from someones collection washed into the cave system.
481,"Lucky, but being in Japan if anything helps. What they found was a deposit created by volcanic activity, something Japan has in abundance, likely some time after the petrification event.    One thing that's tripped Senku up several times now is not fully considering the effects thousands of years passing have had on the world. Tungsten is rare, but if he didn't factor in new mineral deposits being created he probably thought of it as even rarer."
482,"Senku also casually just pulled out a fuckin gallon of mercury this episode. The whole ""oh no, it's impossible!"" thing felt a little heavy handed with how much this show just overlooks problems like this."
483,"Can someone really smart and handy make a ""Primitive Technology"" like youtube channel and try some of the shit Senku is making? Would be really cool."
484,"Some guy made Senku Cola, and it seemed to have mostly worked. Should be easy to find on youtube"
485,"There's a Japanese Youtuber that do some experiments. Seems that they are collaborated with the show, because Mecha Senku is there."
486,"While not exactly the same, the channel How To Make Everything might be close to what you're looking for."
487,Granpa kaseki is fucking dying
488,Hurray for Fridays!    Chrome and Senku be acting like a married
489,     I approve of this
490,That means Gen is a concubine
491,But Senku is already married.....to SCIENCE!
492,That Jump Force character select screen really threw me for a loop at first. Haven’t randomly chuckled that hard in a minute.
493,they really managed to sneak in a christmas episode
494,Tsundare Humanist Mad Scientist Senku
495,"So after cell phones, Senku will make ICBM's right? It's the only logical step to stopping Tsukasa"
496,"They've progressed so far in these 2 months, which was only 1 episode. But now we're getting a fun cave adventure between the unlikeliest of trios. Anyone taking guesses on if Magma screws things up?    Still with only 3 episodes left I think, makes you wonder if we'll see Tsukasa confront Senku before the end of the anime, or if we'll be left in the dark waiting for a season 2. I guess there's not much else in the way of hardships that they have left before they finish making the cell phones though."
497,"As a manga reader, I’m really not sure how they are going to finish this arc in just 3 episodes unless they skip pass a lot of things."
498,"Well, let's hope they decide on a season 2, because they definitely went all in on the marketing before it released."
499,A 12 episode season to will nicely finish the arc.  Then a 24 episode season 3 will finish the current manga arc
500,It would still take a while before a second season likely happens. Maybe it happens end of next year at the earliest. But I would say it has garnered interest and therefore a second season should be in the works.
501,"I was actually really hoping he'd choose Magma. I like it when antagonist becomes allies because their needs align.    I just hope they don't pull a dumb ""Magma tries to kill Senku to become chief"" plot line."
502,"I do think everything they're building is relevant to their needs of course, but I can't help but wish that they were making  some  kind of weapons for their attack even though Senku will most likely find some way to not kill anyone.    Gunpowder is out of the equation due to scarcity of course, and Senku is not Machiavellian enough to make chemical weapons with Ryu-san, but how about some trebuchets to launch 90 kg projectiles over 300 meters at the very least?"
503,"Personally I think Senku should be mass producing crossbows and bolts. They're relatively simple to make, at least compared to guns, and are also easy to use so won't need to train their warriors as much."
504,problem is that we know Tsukasa can evade crossbows
505,"They aren't only facing Tsukasa though. Crossbows should easily dispose of the rest of the army. Also he can dodge one at least, but there's no way he can avoid multiple people continuously firing at him."
506,"He could. The premisse is that he is unfairly OP if his enemies are fighting without firearms. Tsukasa would probably punch the air and the aftershock would blow away all the bolts — that's the type of fantasy-setting Dr. Stone has.    And even if he couldn't, the village doesn't have enough people to wield enough crossbows to be able to make a difference since Senku doesn't have the fluid to unpetrify people and create an army."
507,"Tsukasa will probably have many practiced bowmen who can pull bows with heavy weight. The harder the bowstring is to pull the farther and more powerful the arrow will be. Good chance with superior numbers these simple bows will win the missile battle.    Trebuchets are for non moving targets mainly, huge, don't fire that fast. I go for smaller Catapults, Ballista and the Roman mass arrow firing racks and Roman automatic dart throwers. But that's a lot of  experimentation to build them right, then practice use. it's actually specialty done by Engineers. The Mongels had to hire Engineers to build Trebuchets as they knew what they were but could not build them. So it probably could take a year or more to get good at it and time that much they don't have."
508,"Dude how did I not even think of that    Hell, how did Senku not think of that"
509,Because Tsukasa can easily avoid crossbow bolts
510,"True but I mainly referring to his army, I should’ve specified. Tsukasa probably wouldn’t even avoid it, he’d just backhand the arrow"
511,Tsukasa can’t fight an entire war alone.
512,"Idk, did you see him ohko that lion?"
513,"Distract with katana troops, bait the guards out, attack the food supply."
514,"I gotta believe that Tsukasa is smart enough to expect Senku to do something relating to their food supply if Senku does decide to go through with that, though I guess he would be totally unaware that he's making cell phones."
515,"That's the point, attack various points around his base, he'll expect them to have a static plan and then keep screwing with his mind because they'll communicate in real time."
516,"In that case, I hope they have great 4G so the plan doesn't go awry! s"
517,The show is titled DR.STONE  not MURDER.STONE
518,Give me a spin-off of that so I can see Evil Senku
519,Let's just say you won't be disappointed
520,"Having just watched Drifters a couple weeks ago... can I suggest biological weapons? Cause that shit is easy, pun intended."
521,"     Senku is against killing, at this point"
522,Being against killing is all well and good until that philosophy gets you killed.
523,"the amount of progress they're making just in the process of making a phone is  gigantic . they'll have a huge array of possibilities in terms of weapons by the time they're done here, far better than any primitive attempt that Tsukasa could probably overcome anyway"
524,Super late but I spent like an hour on this so by golly I'm sharing it.    Kohaku and Ruri wine making stitch
525,Boichi bless
526,Thank you for your efforts.
527,Wait.. How come Senku never thought that Tungsten didn't exist at that age?
528,Probably just because Tungsten is so difficult to acquire. Requires modern mining equipment and all that. Is my guess.
529,"Its not that it didn't exist. Its that it were too deep to be acquired and thus discovered with equipment at that time.    Starting from XVIII century, majority of metals were discovered, thanks to new equipment possibly due to invention of steam engine. Between 0C and XVII century only 3 metals were discovered. Before 0C only 6 metals were discovered.       Source."
530,Yeah.. It was kinda weird how it portrayed in the anime that Senku is at a dead end but didn't have an afterthought about the possibility of Tungsten being discovered.
531,The problem is that Tungsten is rare enough that relying on it being found is basically relying on sheer luck to beat Tsukasa. Senku is the type who prefers to make his own luck.
532,"He even says as much when they make the miracle drug. They could do it by dumb luck using bacteria, but fuck that lets do it properly."
533,I am pretty sure the secondary reason why he went that route was because he would use things he created in future projects.
534,"The other route still would have given them equipment like that. I assume he'd have wanted petri dishes, and thus still needed glass."
535,He did say they couldn't make Penicilin because finding a reliable strain would be very very unlikely.    Iirc the strain used for Penicilin was found by chance on a rotting melon in an asian market.
536,     it's actually fungi but yeah
537,"Kinda like the whole ""sulfa drug vs penicillin"" thing. Penicillin may have been better, but finding the correct strain of the mold would require god-tier luck."
538,"        ...why did you write them like that, lol."
539,"Because I can, scrub. Fight me!"
540,ง ͠ ͟لง Have at me!
541,Fuckin chuuni
542,Because Roman numerals is the formal way of writting centuries.
543,"Hmm, I think it might be a regional thing."
544,I've literally never seen anyone do it before in my life.
545,"     Excuse me, wtf?    Just say ""18th"", why did you use roman numerals? The fuck? Why are you making me stop and read this stupid numerical system when we have a perfectly good modern one."
546,Because I can. Deal with it.
547,What a chuuni lmao
548,Because it's a really rare material. He said that scheelite is the world's rarest gemstone himself. He didn't plan on being able to find any.
549,I now want all these rocks to be from a huge collection someone had probably with part displayed in Museum
550,"I love this series so much, the interactions and expressions of the characters really just make it a great time. It's a fresh type of story, for me anyway, as well which I really appreciate, haven't really seen anything since Log Horizon where a guy wins with his brain and strategy instead of power ups or combat.     ;    If you're not, I really recommend reading the manga as well, Boichi's art is God tier."
551,"Just looked it up, Wolfram melts at a temperature of 3695 K 3422 C or  6191F. Curious to see how they are going to melt and turn it into a wire."
552,"dont need to melt it     just extract the tungsten    to do that they need to do a series of chemical reactions mostly redox and generally just roasting it with certain chemicals to make tungsten oxides    then u seperate pure tungsten by reacting it with hydrogen at high temperature to get water and pure tungsten powder    Now that we have pure tungsten powder, how do we make wire?    1. Pressing    Tungsten powder is sifted and mixed. A binder may be added. A fixed amount is weighed and loaded into a steel mold which is loaded into a press. The powder is compacted into a cohesive, yet fragile bar. The mold is taken apart and the bar removed.    2. Presintering    The fragile bar is placed into a refractory metal boat and loaded into a furnace with a hydrogen atmosphere. The high temperature begins to consolidate the material together. Material is about 60% – 70% of full density, with little or no grain growth.     ;    3. Full Sintering    Bar is loaded into a special water-cooled treating bottle. Electric current will be passed through the bar. The heat generated by this current will cause the bar to densify to about 85% to 95% of full density and to shrink by 15% or so. Additionally, tungsten crystals begin to form within the bar.     ;    4. Swaging    The tungsten bar is now strong, but very brittle at room temperature. It can be made more malleable by raising its temperature to between 1200C to 1500C. At this temperature, the bar can be passed through a swager. A swager is a device which reduces the diameter of a rod by passing it through a die which is designed to hammer the rod at about 10,000 blows per minute. Typically a swager will reduce the diameter by about 12% per pass. Swaging elongates the crystals, creating a fibrous structure. Although this is desirable in the finished product for ductility and strength, at this point the rod must be stress-relieved by reheating. Swaging continues until the rod is between .25 and .10 inches.     ;    5. Drawing    Swaged wire of about .10 inches can now be drawn through dies to reduce the diameter. A wire is lubricated and drawn through dies of tungsten carbide or diamond. The exact reductions in diameter depends on the exact chemistry and the final use of the wire. As the wire is drawn, fibers again elongate and tensile strength increases. At certain stages, it may be necessary to anneal the wire to allow further processing. A wire can be drawn as fine as .0005 inches in diameter."
553,Wow I cant believe that just happened.
554,"A sulphuric acid battery AKA, a lead-acid battery provides 2.1V per cell, nominal. With 6 bottlescells, they have created a normal 12.6V lead acid battery. Plenty of power for the lightbulb, and the filament of the vacuum tube, but the plate of the tube is going to need much higher voltage so I suspect he will need a pile cell battery for that."
555,How long can the battery last?
556,"I’m 12,229 days old"
557,I love this anime so much. I cried twice during this episode.
558," WE GOT A MONTAGE BABY!         oilup      Leaking power?  Time to make batteries?  Hmm they had those in anchient egypt so shoudlnt be too hard.      We getting a montage?  I hope so, lets go!      Batteries are already made?  Oh man we are movin fast!      Intense training too?  Gotta get ready to take on Tarzan too.      Senku baiting the oldman with cool stuff to build i love it hahhahaha      HAHHAHAHHA I LOVE HOW EVERYONE IS HAPPY FOR MACHINES!      Bottleing food too huh?  Nice nice.      Lightbulbs now?  I guess you need those for the radio tubes too.      Aw man Oldman.  Everyone is enjoying life more with Senku here.      LEWD BERRY SQUISHING SISTERS!? WEW BOY       We really are getting a montage, its winter already!      Vacume sealing lightbulbs?  Oh shit.      Everyone in winter gear, i love it.      HE MADE A XMAS TREE!? THE MADMAN! HAAHA!  CHRISTMAS!? YOU CRAZY BASTARD!      Monkey is making new stuff again!  It just goes to show with they dont need Senku for there to be Science!      Vacuum Tubes baby, were so close to radios!  Funny enough i have a ton of old vacume tubes because my grandfather was a radio engineer during world war 2, so i have all his old equipment and like 200 tubes from the early 1900s.      Trial and error time, but thats how science happened in the past.      Well we got better light bulbbodies, now to upgrade the filament.  What are filament made of usually?  I dont know.      Melon Lord are you gonna save the day?  You run aroundf a lot, put your eyes to work!      New years now?  OOh shit, the deadline is close.      Senku isnt counting his stone time?  He was awake for it though haha.      MELON LORD WHAT DID YOU FIND!? GLOWY ROCK! Scheelite?  OH SHIT TUNGSTEN!  OH SHIT WE DID IT BOY!      I LOVE THIS CHARACTER SELECT SCREEN! HAHAHA      Magma?  Oh yeah they need a strong man for this job.  Put him to good use, make him a miner, hes the best man for the job!"
559,I agree. The pace was too fast
560,"The pace wasnt fast, a montage was great to get past the grind of upgrading.         yousaidsomethingdumb"
561,theres just too many stuff happening
562,I can guarantee there will be a moment Magma considers betraying or does betray them next episode. But then he will come to his senses or Senku will find a way out and make up with magma later
563,"But does Magma really have a reason to do it? It's not like he's getting excluded by all the benefits of having Senku on his side, besides he's not the guy that think too much beyond."
564,Power blinds
565,Magma did nothing wrong.
566,Took 2 months to finish making light bulbs even with the necessary knowledge. Each milestone really just makes you appreciate modern life more and more.
567,"Gotta love how Santa didn't get stoned like everyone else. That said, what the hell does Santa even do now? Has he just been on long vacations? Do his elves even need to work at this point? It's not like they have to work hard to give gifts to only a few hundred people."
568,I still don't know why the vacuum tube failed the second time the bamboo filament burned. Isn't it supposed to NOT burn because it's a vacuum? What destroys it?
569,it simbly degrades atoms fall off the filament due to the hih enrgy state heat is basically vibrating monlecules it didnt burn oxidation reaction but instead simply pulled itself apart
570,"Not a scientist. Just from the story it seemed like the level of vacuum was good enough for the filament in a normal bulb, but not the vacuum tube, so they tried to burn the trace 02 with phosphorus.     My guess is that it burns much easier than the filament? Anyway, that slight heat expanded the wire."
571,"holy shit, i can't believe it, the plot twist is ATOMIC NUMBER 74"
572,"Watching this episode on my PC: Beginners Meta      Streaming the Episode to my PC using Wifi: Meta      Using a Vacuum Tube to drive my Headphones to watch the episode: Full Meta                  So they found Tungsten thanks to the sunrise. No better way to start the new year in the land of the rising sun!     Fun fact: Remember a few episodes before when everyone thought Senku is going to build nukes, with Tungsten this is no mere dream      There are plans and studies to use Tungsten rod from orbit to bomb cities. They dont burn up on reentry and the explosive power would come from the kinetic energy delivered by the rod"
573,Are you using an early 20th century amplifier? Vacuum tubes haven't been in use for decades.
574,Nah its a cheap ass Tube amp for headphones                But there are more elaborate units out there
575,"     Well, there were plans. They got scrapped when people figured it was prohibitively expensive to fly giant rods of tungsten into orbit, not to mention that they would be a bit clunky to use as you can't really reposition the things once in orbit so you kind of just have to wait for them to orbit into the correct position for your strike which would take way too long. Additionally they're only really useful when you've already dedicated yourself to using a weapon with the equivalent power of a nuke, at which point you might as well use the cheaper and more convenient nukes."
577,"Really curious how they're going to refine that tungsten. It has a melting point of about 3,400 degrees, more than double what is required for iron. Not sure if even the watermill powered bellows they already have will be enough for that."
578,"     dont need to melt it    just extract the tungsten    to do that they need to do a series of chemical reactions mostly redox and generally just roasting it with certain chemicals to make tungsten oxides    then u seperate pure tungsten by reacting it with hydrogen at high temperature to get water and pure tungsten powder    Now that we have pure tungsten powder, how do we make wire?    1. Pressing    Tungsten powder is sifted and mixed. A binder may be added. A fixed amount is weighed and loaded into a steel mold which is loaded into a press. The powder is compacted into a cohesive, yet fragile bar. The mold is taken apart and the bar removed.    2. Presintering    The fragile bar is placed into a refractory metal boat and loaded into a furnace with a hydrogen atmosphere. The high temperature begins to consolidate the material together. Material is about 60% – 70% of full density, with little or no grain growth.    3. Full Sintering    Bar is loaded into a special water-cooled treating bottle. Electric current will be passed through the bar. The heat generated by this current will cause the bar to densify to about 85% to 95% of full density and to shrink by 15% or so. Additionally, tungsten crystals begin to form within the bar.    4. Swaging    The tungsten bar is now strong, but very brittle at room temperature. It can be made more malleable by raising its temperature to between 1200C to 1500C. At this temperature, the bar can be passed through a swager. A swager is a device which reduces the diameter of a rod by passing it through a die which is designed to hammer the rod at about 10,000 blows per minute. Typically a swager will reduce the diameter by about 12% per pass. Swaging elongates the crystals, creating a fibrous structure. Although this is desirable in the finished product for ductility and strength, at this point the rod must be stress-relieved by reheating. Swaging continues until the rod is between .25 and .10 inches.    5. Drawing    Swaged wire of about .10 inches can now be drawn through dies to reduce the diameter. A wire is lubricated and drawn through dies of tungsten carbide or diamond. The exact reductions in diameter depends on the exact chemistry and the final use of the wire. As the wire is drawn, fibers again elongate and tensile strength increases. At certain stages, it may be necessary to anneal the wire to allow further processing. A wire can be drawn as fine as .0005 inches in diameter."
579,Wow. That was very informative. Thank you. Definitely looking forward to the next episode now.
580,your welcome    i really wanna see how they pull off the last 2 steps though
581,Well done KOS citizen
582,"Just googled it because I was curious, and it’s actually pretty interesting - from what I understand, you can form copper into a few tubes and then run both water and electricity through them, which will heat up the tungsten through current induction while keeping the copper cool enough to not get melted itself. The process has to be performed in a vacuum because of Tungsten’s ability to react though.    Coincidentally, Senku’s had practice with vacuums, copper and batteries now."
583,So Senku is just training Kaseki  for the past 2 months for the vacuum tube component
584,"Since I haven't seen anyone else point it out yet, they showed an APFSDS shell.    Specifically, a 120mm APFSDS shell, as what it says on the label.    It stands for armour piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot, and is the primary ammunition tanks use to penetrate armour to kill other tanks. They are essentially big metal darts surrounded by a jacket called a sabot that falls off as the shell is fired from the gun.    They're usually made of extremely dense metal, such as tungsten or depleted uranium."
585,I thought I was the only one who noticed. Who thought tank-nerdery would come back to help me in such an unrelated anime.    Though I was a bit confused when they launched it like a rocket.
586,"I really loved the scene of Gen and Senku bonding over Christmas. Chances are it's not a tradition that the people of the village kept, so it's nice that they both get to share it with someone"
587,"This cellphone plan can go wrong in way too many ways.    Only modern phones are tiny, primitive phones were huge, how they are going to hide it from the enemy? tsukasa and his band surely are smart enough to understand what it is.  And what if tsukasa decided to get rid of his friends preemptively?   Or isolate them?   Just not giving them any useful for Senku intel?    In best case scenario, what kind of advantage can Senku get when he has an army on his doorstep?    Smartest thing to do here would probably be getting rid ofgetting on his side the pink haired gymnast and running away.       Anyway, really intrigued by the cave exploration ark"
588,I wonder why he keeps saying Cellphone when he's going for simple radios as shown in the use cartoon.   And hell Cellphones have a short range you want proper radios that can have much greater range including around the world for Short Wave.     I saw Army Radio Specialist build all sort of big and fancy antenna's just using wire strung between trees and then pick up stuff from huge distances. All the science to get the right antenna shapes that actually sort of seams like magic when you think of it.
589,Senku be like  omae wa mou shindeiru    tsukasa:  shocked emoji 
590,Kaseki best waifu
591,"I have a bad feeling that Magma is an enemy spy andor bad actor. Think about it, Tuskasa's empire is where the strong survive. It's the perfect place for a meat head like Magma whose tired as hell of scientific chores.    That, or he and Senku bond in the cave and become best friends."
592,Rare moments where Senku struggled.    3 more eps to go. I wish season 2 would come sooner.
593,Would be good if they actually release it on spring
594,Brrrrrakamono I have read the manga. Obviously I will not be spoiling it
595,"Resolution felt a little too convenient here.    On the other hand, I liked seeing Senku realize that he might have to scrap his plans.  I do wish we had dwelled on that aspect a little longer, see more of other people's reactions. Senku is too practical to give into despair, but it might have been interesting to see him grappling with how to let everyone know that they might need to revisit the plan, wondering how people would react.    Loved the christmas tree scene."
596,Oh god I read ahead in the manga. Must resist spoiling it for myself. Only three episodes to go this season.
597,the manga’s art is so good tho
598,"Freakin loved this episode. Senku is awesome. Senku truly is   MVPOE: Most Valuable Person on Earth   He's literally advancing this village in technology faster than anyone in history with his huge knowledge of science. Watching it unfold is so rewarding.     Seeing the Mentalist happy makes me happy. I think he knows he chose the right side. Tsukasa is all about power and new world order but he seems heavily short sighted in his long term goal. Senku has everything you need that it makes Tsukasa look like the biggest fool on Earth. The Mentalist grabbing Senku to have him watch the New Year's sunrise with the village was pretty damn adorable I have to say. He's grown on me so much.    I was really touched when Senku made the Christmas tree right on time for Christmas day. It shows really how awesome Senku is as a person. He didn't need to but he did it and even those who don't know of that tradition were moved by it. Senku acts like a ""100% rational science addict"" but deep down he's a kind and emotional person that cares for others. Senku also doesn't get down in the dumps when he fails, he always keeps going in a positive manner. After all, science is born upon failure. When he thought things weren't working out with cell phones, he was ready to focus on a new goal - he's really an incredible role model. Go team Senku!     Shout out to Gramps for being amazing 247     Also the nice little touches make this show even better like the video game character selection screen"
599,"Excuse me, but what is this?    Did they forget to re add the top layer?"
600,"Do you mean the bevel gears? They are generally used to change the operating angle. From that picture, they appear to be changing the angle by 90 degrees. Their ratio appears to be close to 1:1 but not quite, so some mechanical advantage as well, in addition to the 90 turn.    "
601,"It's an awkward angle to be showing that, and threw me at first too. If it was a little above or to either side of that, it would be easier to tell that they are two ""half-cone"" shaped gears pressed against each other."
602,What else would they be?
603,"Well, from that angle, it's hard to tell what they are. It's so straight on that it really does seem like there's a graphical glitch and that there should be a layer of content covering up the right side of the image and maybe the lower third so that it seems like a single completed piece. If you don't have a head for projecting objects in three dimensions and mechanical engineering, I can see getting a bit lost."
604,What do you mean?
605,Will a single episode go by where I don't get goosebumps!
606,the character select gimmick was so extra i love it
607,"Not gonna lie, when Senku was deciding I was almost sure that Magma would be picked."
608,Ruri got that chariot
609,How does DC light bulbs work?    Does it matter if it's AC or DC?
610,"Afaik most low voltage appliances use DC, and generally have a converter. Of course this doesn't matter if you're using batteries or are very near the energy source, but given that DC loses power over long distances we use AC to transport it more compactly."
611,AC allowed to easily convert between voltages with the tech available at the end of the 19th century. High voltage is key to longrange power transmission. New power backbones are in high voltage DC because DC doesn't suffer from parasitic capacitances. Watch Electroboom for entertaining explanations
612,"Cool, truth to be told it's been about 4 years since my last Physics class. I remember some stuff but not that much."
613,"The idea behind light bulbs is just that the filament is heated by the current to the point where it starts emitting light. It works for both AC and DC, but you can get a stroboscopic effect with AC, since the light strobes with the double the frequency of the current."
614,"Well, filament bulbs dont noticeably flicker because they have thermal mass."
615,Santa didn't get stoned.    Santa is the reason behind the world's petrification confirmed.
616,"Narnia has proven Santa is immune to villains, that's why."
617,Santa's based in South America?
618,Aren't vacuum tubes a technology prone to failure?
619,Yeah because the tubes themselves are prone to break but it's either that or transistors which they can't make yet.
620,"Semiconductors take a bit more work to make... As in, an entire planet's worth of work."
621,Vacuum Tubes are still used for high end amplifiers and equipment for audiophiles.     I seen simple transistors made in the 70's at the Plant that made the US Atomic Bomb Triggers. Seamed simple enough spinning stuff around a wire with various color codes for what they did. Sort of a clay mixed with plastic like stuff covering. But researching now it unfortunate no image of this process shown.  It does seam materials to make hard.     Of course they did not say what they built there I learned that from the newspaper. It was a General Electric Plant in center of Pinellas County FL. Shut down when US reduced Nuclear weapons after cold war ended. My dad was one of three records safe custodians on top of management job so he actually had access to how to build the bomb.   I was told it took months to prepare for visitors the one and only time families were allowed to tour. Tons of equipment and early computers. The idea someone building a bomb in their basement was always super stupid it takes a Government with millions of dollars and very specialized expensive equipment in large numbers to do one and it takes years to figure it out.
622,"The proccess of creating a functional semiconductor is anything but simple, requiring a crystal to be grown from a kernel, atomic dopants to be deposited in precise amounts and even then, immature fabrication yields high failure rates. A diode is only useful if it acts predictably at a specific voltampere range."
623,And that's how Senku saved Christmas.
624,"the animation keep getting worst and the drawing too... i wonder if they didnt have enough time to polish things, after the nasa episode, you can notice how different the quality of the anime is, not hating, probably didnt have the time or something.    cant wait to see magma interaction with senku and chrome."
625,Could anything from the modern world have survived all that time till the current world.  Could they find old tech or other things.
626,"Stone things and some nuclear disposal, pretty much. 3700 years ago our civilization only really used stone to build and even then most ancient cities are lost."
627,Landfills would be great sources of all sorts of stuff but it looks like that area has had major land movement and floods so landfill contents probably spread all over. And plastic on surface degraded away totally and the buried stuff will be partially decayed at best. Plastic does not Bio degrade but it does break down over time and they had lots of time.
628,"     I mean, most of it was mud, wood, etc. But that decays much more quickly than stone."
629,I'm waiting for the discovery of a time capsule.
630,KONO BANGUMI WA GORA NO SPONSO TEIKYOU DE   OH CHRISTMAAAAS  !
631,With all this automation I realised this isn't anime minecraft. It's Factorio.
632,This is how show is so damn wholesome. Just what I need at 8 pm when I'm drunk
633,The ost is so good gives the show so much personality and is a big reason why this adaptation has been so entertaining.
634,"well damn they were alluding to magma a lot, so this is where we learn more about him. i feel like he is going to betray the group for some reason, but hopefully he converts over to the kingdom of science"
635,It's really good can't wait for next week
636,I love that they arn't glossing over winters prep and actually introduced things like bottling even if it was only as part of a montage.
637,Yo this episode is so good! So many tender moments!
638,I kind of want to see how Tsukasa and his group reacted to all of this.
639,That tree is absolutely going to burn down.
640,There are no house cats in the future.
641,"Since this is a discussion thread, I want to discuss two words: gorilla warefare.  Senku’s camp lacks man power. The right hand lady Homura could have done so much damage if she was instructed to also use gorilla warefare on top of spying; she could have been instructed to only use such tactics when she knows she’s 10 billion percent going to succeed without jeopardizing her life...Chrome running of by himself, villagers fishing out in the middle of the lake, villagers farming out in the field. Picking somebody off every so often can do so much damage to a group that is already limited in man power.    On ambush, the village is literally open to attack...there’s no gate no walls or anything; the village that’s not on the island literally opens into the forest. Homura could come at any angle. Just because the hydroelectric powerplant was acquired doesn’t mean it can’t be destroyed.    On top of the destruction, the tactic can impede the movement of the whole village by destroying their morale; no one knows where the next attack is going to come from and no one knows who will be next victim. Paralysis by analysis. No one will want to go explore, no one will want to do anything except if they’re well guarded. More man power will have to be directed into defense. From the episode, we can see that every attribute was put into offense and the group still only managed to just be on schedule. The group would not have been on schedule if some attributes were divided into defending the village and paralysis by analysis.    The cotton candy doesn’t resolve the issue. We know there’s no way to convert Homura. If she was instructed to use gorilla warefare, she would use gorilla warefare. I don’t read the comics so this is just based on this episode.     Overall, I really like the show and it’s my top favorite anime of the season so far."
642,"Just a slight correction, the term is ""Guerrilla warfare"". Gorilla warfare would have probably included Kohaku ;-"
643,It was pretty hilarious to read though. Haha
644,To think someone actually fell for the memes... post-2000 generations are doomed.
645,or probably pre-1980's I don't have time to keep up with memes.
646,Ok boomer
647,"Tsukasa does not seam to have any military, or history background. He did sort of discuss quick action but then settled on overwhelming force.  I'm a former US Army Infantry Reserve Officer I would of course been doing like you suggested and maybe even try launching a mid winter bliz for total surprise if the weather looked good. I would have already started on my ""Navy"" to go on the Lake before it got too cold.     But for a want to be 3rd World Warlord which Tsukasa is I find his lack of skill at war believable. There seams to be no limit to how stupid some places so so military are run and fight wars."
648,Pretty much the arc right now     ;    They better get on it before Tsukasa's grasshoppers arrives
649,This anime is like that Robot Chicken skit about montages
650,Good effort spent on making a christmas tree. Priorities...
651,Confirmed Suika is 3 times stronger than Senku
652,what the heck happened to the strong guy and the chick with headphones from the first few episodes?
653,They are spies at enemy territory
654,"missed that, thanks!"
655,I finally caught up to the latest episode. It's much better binge-watching this show. I can really see this show for what it is now. Before I couldn't and was way too harsh. It's just fun. Then ending segments were awesome.
656,"With the brilliance and power of Science, I hope this show will have a second season. One million percent!"
657,Such a fun show
658,what chap is this
659,The end of the episode was the end of chapter 54.
660,the snow is comfy
661,Time for Magma and co.'s spelunking fun time adventure!
662,Detective Suika once again saves the day...with a Chrome assist.
663,Great santa still alive
664,didn't know we were getting a Christmas special    edit: Christmas and New Year's special
665,TIL Tungsten is this rare. I wonder why Senku didn't at least try looking in the cave
666,Because looking for rare metals without detection equipment is a waste of time.
667,This. And Chrome highlighted that now with flashlights they can now explore deeper
668,"Most of those contraptions are made of wood, wouldn't it be bad if a rainy day deteriorated them?"
669,Senku about to find Allen Wrench in a cave and have his tungsten stolen by a metal space wrench.
670,  SCIENCE  
671,"""Hey, you know that would-be double murderer whose dastardly plans we foiled? Yeah, we'll trust him with our lives now."""
672,So when is our world going to be petrified like Dr. stone? I've been getting into Primitive stuffs lately.
673,This was such a wholesome episode
674,"Senku is 6,925 days old, Senku is legal confirmed!"
675,"Damn, I was a little sad at first that the season was going to end going through another “road map” as it sometimes is slow and not necessary very exciting.    However, I was totally wrong. I am loving this so much. The story is just so damn interesting. Excited to see this “dungeon anime” next week!"
676,What kind of cave was Chrome exploring where you can find big solid clumps of various different minerals lying around?
677,"While the tungsten rocket piercing the heat dinosaur is good, please appreciate the awesomeness that was this convenient manga melting point cheatsheet."
678,Watching Dr. Stone just makes me crave for playing Factorio again...
679,I wish this anime continue forever
681,"awesome episode. this one went by so fast. vacuum tubes = gears of the electric world is a great analogy.    i thought the christmas part kind of took away from the story though. why put the lights you spent two months creating onto a random tree instead of in the village and in houses? and the santa scene was random, it seemed like an inconsistency with everything else going on so far."
