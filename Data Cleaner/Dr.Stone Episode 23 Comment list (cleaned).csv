1,"I've just read the chapters shown in this episode today. Seems like we'll be finishing the season with  ""his dad's record and Lilian's song?""    Kind of a shame the season is ending, since we won't see the phone in use yet.    They also tease us Tsukasa's companions, Nikki?"
2,"When the old OP started playing I was scared that it was the end of the episode and or season. Happily I was wrong.    And never skip arm day, that Ginro catch can only be preformed by the people willing to dedicate to their entire life to guard sitting."
3,"     Yeah, that bit there felt like a season finale."
4,Someone should convince them to greenlight a second season by telling them that it promotes interest in science.     chitosesmug
5,"Well there's an ""important announcement"" in next week's JUMP so it's probably happening."
6,Is it doing well? I love this show.
7,"I subscribed to Shonen Jump just to read the manga week to week, so it better be doing good."
8,you can read the lastest chapters from their official app.
9,Not sure.  But Jump is running a spin-off manga about Senku's father alongside Dr. Stone.  My Hero Academia also has a spin-off manga running.    My guess is the Dr. Stone anime and manga are doing quite well.
10,"sales are below all the flagship jump titles, and it only overtook Black Clover with the anime boost. However, the editorial staff seems to like it so it should be pretty safe. Also Jump can't really afford to cancel relatively successful series at the moment."
11,Don't know if they will have enough material since there is just one arc after this before we get to the ongoing manga arc.    Possibly they could start it in summer or fall 2020.
12,theres just over a season's worth more to adapt right now manga wise
13,"And if they don't start production immediately, which is common as far as I understand, there's plenty of time for new chapters to be released as well."
14,"late reply, but this episode ends at the end of chapter 58 of the manga, with the next episode probably ending at the end of chapter 60.    The manga itself is currently at chapter 132. There is quite enough material for a two cour season two."
15,"There’s still a lot to cover of just the stone wars, and one episode left this season if I’m not mistaken. Unless they rush we’re going to be left with a cliffhanger and won’t even wrap this arc up UNTIL season 2, and the manga will be another while ahead of the anime once again with probably another full arc completed and ready to start on."
16,HXH GETS NEW SEASON EEEEEEEHHHHH    jk
17,"I mean, when you think about it, isn't the anime just on a giant... hiatus ...?"
18,"Hope its not a ""final manga arc"""
19,Inagaki said 3 more years about 2 weeks ago so ur fine
20,Season 2 = Justice
21,"I flicked my mouse to see remaining time, it seemed that clean a transition into credits."
22,Just a training montage thankfully
23,"For a slight moment, as I instantly remembered that there was another episode left, I thought they were doing the equivalent to the classic ""let's left the finals of this tournament for the next season""."
24,"Right? It felt kinda out of place tbh, I know that the moment was kinda big but perhaps regular soundtrack would have been better. I did have a ""chotto matte"" moment when I heard it"
25,Anyway it'll end next week which is bit hard for me to digest as it was such a good journey to come this far. Hope they'll announce next season at the end of the episode!
26,So soon no Dr Stone nor The Good place on Fridays. Where am I gonna get my pre-weekend positivity fix from? Life!? Nah.
27,My answer is probably same!
28,Definitely not from High School Prodigies after that abysmal episode 8 or whichever last week's was. Don't think I can bring myself to finishing it after that.
29,Just recently started The Good place now im depressed ive caught up!
30,Its so good  was not expecting such an enjoyable storyline for a comedy
31,Guess we'll just have to make do with Hero Academia Saturdays for now
32,And Vinland Sundays
33,Only through December. :
34,We still got Fire Force Friday.
35,"2uper is probably getting announced later this month.     While not airing on the same day, it will fill the void left in my soul."
36,"Harley Quinn is every Friday. I mean it's not anime, but it's wonderful."
37,     I sure hope they do
38,They better. You can’t can’t build up to a battle and then just not do it
39,Hopefully it won't be a movie. I hate waiting more than 6 months for those sequel movies to get at least a decent release outside Japan and the US.
40,"I'm crossing my fingers for a second season announcement right at the end of the next episode and maybe a PV the next week, since one week after the show ends ""Jump Festa"" starts and they already announced a Dr. Stone panel there."
41,Also this week's issue of Weekly Shonen Jump apparently teases major Dr.Stone news for the next issue. So a season 2 reveal is looking pretty likely next week.
42,"I thought it was 26 episodes, so 3 more episodes ?"
43,Nah! it's 24 episode season.
44,"I swear I saw it was going to be 26 eps somewhere , welp now I'm sad."
45,You can recheck on My Anime List
46,"There is apparently going to be a major Dr.Stone announcement next week in WSJ and Jump Festa is like 3 weeks away, chances are we should be getting season 2 reveal soon."
47,That's goods news for us
48,     Luffy approves
49,Gomu gomu no 
50,I was so confused because I was pretty sure there was one episode left. It's rare having the OP play like that in the second to last episode.
51,I didn't even realize it was the old OP at first and was about to fastforward the episode to post-credit scenes.
52,Same hahahaha
53,"I also felt that it was the end of the season, thank God i was wrong."
54,Ginro really checked Kinro's vibe there
55,"I thought they some how messed up the episode bc it played the visuals for the first op too, not just the music"
56,"The most wholesome moment of this entire show was when all kaseki wanted was a high five from senku. Plus, senku leaving things to chrome really makes him feel more like senkus equal in intelligence, something the shows been building to since they built the water wheel without him. Also, heating the village while geting the coal dust was a great example of senku killing two birds with one stone. Bringing back good morning world was a nice touch, even if it took me by surprise"
57,"Yeah, I love how Senku trusts the villagers to work on things without supervision once he's trained them up a bit, especially Chrome because he's just so into it"
58,"It really shows how much hes grown from the beginning of the series, where with taiju he basically had to babysit him whenever he had a task, to now he has several sub teams working on different projects."
59,"To be fair though, Taiju was a bit slow..."
60,"Yeah, but he was a lovable kinda slow"
61,Not so lovable or he wouldn't have been ditched
62,"Don't work hard enough for Senku and he'll turn you into a spy for the enemy, a true dictator."
63,"Fucking hell, Senku's greatest power comes not from his science knowledge but from being a scrum master."
64,"That's... that's the way science works. It's not just Neil Armstrong setting foot on the moon and saying 'One small step for Man. One ...Tiant leap for mankind.'    It's THOUSANDS of engineers, machinists, computer scientists, astronomers, chemists, and more, and then EVERYONE who feeds them all working in tandem. You can't have Astronauts hopping around in 16g without the seamstresses who hand-sewed the Mercury and Apollo pressure suits. HELL YES, the organizers are important.    The quote from   Jasper   Kohaku and Ruri's dad is the one I've been waiting for. 'It's completely unreleated, but everything you do just happens to enrich the village, doesn't it?'    'That's just the way science works.'    And   Jasper   the former cheiftan feels 3000 years of preparation whipping him up into Senku's plan and realizing just how very big it is."
65,"     I was sure you were going to finish that sentence with ""hand-sewed the Mariner and Apollo core rope memory, but that works too."
66,"Rope memory was woven rather than sewn, but still, the NASA guys called it 'Little old Lady Memory' for a reason."
67,"Wait, NASA made computers in the 1960s capable of handling moon landings with  rope !? What isn't possible!!"
68,"Well, the computers back then weren't the general purpose things we have today.      They are more closely related to ASICs or FPGAs, where the functionality was literally built into the hardware.      It means they could do that one task super well, but were absolutely useless at anything else.      A comparison would be...    Trying to play a blue ray disk inside a dvd drive."
69,"NOTHING is impossible, with SCIENCE!       MUAHAHAHAHAHAA!   "
70,If I recall correctly - it was the women who worked for Playtex who made them - legit the only people NASA could find who could sew within the tolerance of 164th of an inch.
71,"'It's completely unreleated, but everything you do just happens to enrich the village, doesn't it?'    Just like many inventions were a direct consequence of the space race"
72,That is not jasper
73,Well I'll be a stone statue.
74,Senku is an interesting character. He is a sciencey character but he does not come from the Western tradition of smart characters. These characters tends to be arrogant and assholes. But Senku is first and foremost a shonen MC. Shonen MC's are social and amicable. They are rough around the edges but a common power they have is making friends.
75,Like a certain Merlin?
76,This made my day.
77,"As a project manager, this makes me happy"
78,I wonder if Tsukasa brought them along as hostages or not. It’d make sense considering how big a weak spot they are for Senku.
79,"Its the only reason i can see for tsukasa to keep them around, especially now that he knows senku is alive"
80,"nah I don't think that he's ""grown"" at all as a character.He has made others grow,find their calling or influence them to become better people but Senku himself remains pretty much the same.Chrome was extraordinarily curious right from the start & Senku has always looked at him for ancillary science stuff.If anything,it shows that Senku is a great leader."
81,He gave purpose to other characters.
82,The most wholesome moment of this entire show was when Senku made cola
83,Suika getting her glasses is a contender for wholesome moment too
84,"Absolutely. The only reason it doesn't win in my opinion is because fixing her vision was necessary. Still wholesome as heck how he did it, but a wholesome byproduct"
85,It is really relatable to the memory of getting your first pair of glasses.
86,"I legitimately was pissed when Good Morning World came on and tried to skip past it for some after-outro scenes, then realized that it wasn't actually the outro hahaha"
87,They way this show shares the spotlight among characters is a treat.
88,The look on Chrome's face when he realized Senku saw him as an equal was really touching.
89,"From a primitive ""cavemen"" actually fishermen tribe, calling himself sorcerer to sound badass because deep down he realize ""stone collector"" is lame,    To a scientist, actually making change in the village.    Same with kaseki"
90,"Yes, Chrome has been unexpectedly great since the moment he showed up."
91,"Damn that part with Gen singing was so cool. But what was even cooler was that final montage using the first OP.    Fuck, just one episode left. Well, I'm sure as hell will not be waiting until season 2. Right after next week's episode, I will be reading all the manga."
92,"i enjoy these montages ,  no dialogue just OST with the gang doing their stuff as time passes"
93,Stone rapper Gen was so strangely funny     mmmmyrgh
94, Brutality on best modern boi intensifies                                        Edit: The video link got taken down
95,Didn't take long to get blocked
96,I can see it though...                         Edit: nevermind
97,That montage in the first episode with Senku and Taiju creating the lab and making the nital was awesome
98,"I'm honestly tempted to tell everyone to hold out until the next seasons, because I just want to see the first reactions to some of the batshit crazy stuff that will happen in the future. But the manga is just amazing."
99,Which manga chapter is next week's episode and how far along is the Manga as in chapter number?
100,"Next episode will start from Chapter 59, but I'd really suggest to go through the previous chapters too because the art is astonishingly good."
101,Also more sciencey details and extra stuff
102,Theres some extra stuff when Senku met Chrome. Also the art itself is worth the read
103,"Hopefully we get to hear that song.      The manga version made me tear up, I predict the anime version is going to leave me bawling"
104,I predict 60 or 61
105,"Next week will cover 59 and 60 and maybe a bit of 61 since it would be great for a cliffhanger for next season as it's the stone wars launch chapter.    The manga is up to 120+ chapters right now so enough for another 24 episodes season, which is likely to happen since the anime seems to be really popular as well as the manga."
106,Don’t worry I’ll wait it out for you. <3
107,"I'm not reading, so don't worry.    I read chapters 1-19 so right when he got to the village when it was first coming out weekly, realized it was going to be an amazing series and stopped reading because I KNEW there was going to be an anime.    After waiting for that, I'm waiting for S2."
108,"Gen singing was a PPAP spoof, right?"
109,Yeah the pen pineapple thing!
110,"That's a Kojima Yoshio's refference, a popular Japanese comedian back."
111,One of the few rappers Eminem was too afraid to diss.
112,I truly miss the original OP. I sing along with the intro 「おはよう世界　GOOD MORNING WOOORLLLD！g’morning wooorllld」it was refreshing to hear it again and see the dawn setting on the rotating globe.
113,"same, I had to hold myself back so hard not to read the manga"
114,"Oh, do wait until next week. If what I think is coming is, it is so very worth the wait for the immense payoff."
115,The manga is excellent and things escalate rapidly from this point.
116,"I hope Kaseki lives long enough to reach their goals. I look forward to him wearing a dwarven exo-suit while assembling their spaceship to reach the moon. This episode is so good, everyone got their chance to contribute and display their uniqueness"
117,"That's the big hand grenade the mangaka is holding. You can't make a character  this  important without the health issues the elderly would face.  At least, not if you're trying for accuracy like Dr. Stone is."
118,"The accuracy of an old man ripping his clothing by simply flexing and of a young man smashing the head of a lion with a kick?    Dr. Stone follows our science and our logic, but it's still shounen at hearth.     100% the old age of Kaseki will be used somehow, but this doesn't mean that it will be realistic."
119,Well they already used his old age this episode on how he thought he was too old to bee their crafts buddy
120,"I meant related to his health condition.  Kaseki getting a really bad back-pain  losing part of his sight could lead to him being less ""overpowered"" when it comes to crafting things for Senku, causing them to either help him out or he could start being a mentor for someone else that is pretty good at the same thing."
121,They need to train more apprentices for  Kaseki. Hopefully Chrome and Suika and some villagers lika the fatso Ganen
122,"I think its more likely they'll just revive people who are into crafts, and then they can be best buddies with Kaseki. Yuzuriha was in a crafts club too, so they might even make her the successor"
123,Would be epic seeing Yuzuriha blowing glass and pounding metal
124,"Right? I'm hoping they'll actually do that, or at least have her teach Kaseki all kinds of cool new tricks"
125,"        Gotta disagree here, the fact no one has died yet even without modern medicine and technology is weird. Then you have all the problems related to massive incest and that they are getting resources too fast to be even real    Theorically all they do is possible , but it is impossible to get all the needed resources"
126,Chrome has created a headstart by hoarding materials since he was young
127,"The ending sequence with the first opening was fucking hype man.    Also, when Kaseki cried, i've cried too. It must have been hard for him to live his whole life without being aknowlodge by his skills, i will cry if he dies in the anime.    Also ,can we give extra appreciation for Senku for using time for building the cellphone to build a steam roomfor the old and kids? If my boss was just like his lol."
128,"Dude he didn’t just make one for the kids,  every  house has one now, he literally providing heating to every home as a  side project "
129,"Well it's not totally a side project, they need to burn the coal somehow, and it's just efficient to use it for heating since otherwise it's just excess energy being wasted."
130,Happy workers are far more productive
131,"tell that to every employer I've ever had, please"
132,"ya, i wish this is common sense to employers."
133,"Acquiring coal ash, making a heating system and stoves simultaneously, enhancing the well-being and productivity of workers and the technological advancement of the village... he just killed a whole V-formation of birds with one stone huh"
134,He probably used a catapult.
135,A trebuchet...
136,"Not to mention that being cold slowed down the work of the others, so not only is it a quality of life upgrade for everyone, it also boosts the efficiency of the other projects going on. It's just all around a very pragmatic thing to do."
137,"A happy & healthy workforce is an efficient workforce. That's what scientific civilisation  should  be all about. Sadly, ours seems to have lost sight of that..."
138,"Why make massively more profits as a whole, if I can make less but keep all of it for myself by abusing my workforce?"
139,Why have a better long term workforce if I can just bleed them dry so I can profit  now ?
140,Have we? We've pulled more people out of abject poverty than ever before BECAUSE of capitalism and the average quality of life for humans on Earth is the highest it's ever been throughout history.    This is literally the benchmarkgoal that Senku is trying to hit lol...
141,More than half of that was by redefining abject poverty.
142,"No it wasn't, it was because we made products that increase quality of living so god damn cheap anybody could afford them."
143,"Please go to really impoverished countries once in your life. They aren't lacking cheap plastic shit, it's infrastructure, chemicals and machinery. And it didn't get all that better.    Besides, abject poverty was literally redefined. And it massively failed to take into account inflation or rising material prices.    If you really want to fix abject poverty, it's absolutely 100% not about making stuff cheaper, it's about political change to allow actual development and safety. And I'm sure you'll notice the political situation is far from improving. The reason why senku succeeds in the anime is literally because he isn't being capitalist at the very beginning. He isn't trying to exploit the poor villagers by talking as much profit as possible while investing in the least amount of infrastructure and education possible, like what's happening in say the DRC, but instead he's building a ton of infrastructure, explaining exactly how its working, forming engineers and scientists, stabilizing the political situation without tyranizing the citizens of the village, collectivizing the profits and fruits of the citizens labor and so on. He isn't making an iPhone to ship it off thousands of kilometres away because he owns imaginary intellectual property rights, neither is he extracting minerals from dying communities, bribing and manipulating  in order to politically destabilize as much as possible.    This is the thing, you actually don't know what capitalism is. And you don't know from where poverty really comes from. It's not because a smartphone is becoming less expensive, it's about the price of steel, machining, the local chemical industry, and so on. That much should be clear from watching the anime. And it turns out for a ton of these poor countries either the political situation is so fucked that it's impossible to make good long term local investments, or the wages are kept low enough while flooding the market with foreign products to prevent local industry from growing. Add to that intellectual property rights which would prevent them from doing what Senku did and which, oddly enough, are almost always only enforced for industry matters in poor countries and you've got yourself the actual explanation for poverty. Trust me, having a 25$ smartphone that can barely run candycrush isn't a worthwhile trade for being unemployed while the family farm is being outcompeted by the foreign industrial farm and there is a group of warlords eyeing the mineral resources nearby, coming into violent conflict.    This is a long winded comment, but essentially, no we aren't doing much do fix poverty. We're not even trying, actually. Really fixing poverty and getting the machine going in Africa, middle Asia and so on is so much against our interests that we just won't do it.    That's the thing, right. Tsukasa isn't actually wrong in some of his analysis of the root cause of the issue, he's just way too stupid and hubristic to realize that his solution will never work. And Senku does realize that the society he would actually be rebuilding and the society he has grown in the village are politically so far removed from one another, it's just that he's just kinda given up on trying to do much better which is fair. I'd imagine that when some of the greedier people he revived try to stop his project of reviving everyone in order to secure more power or resources he will have to come to terms that his experiment worked in large part because he hasn't replicated the old political structure. If Tsukasa actually had absolutely no argument at all it would be a much lesser anime."
144,"In what way? We live pretty damn fuckin good lives in the developed world.    Even a lot of our poor people are rich by the world's standards.    A lot of people are unhappy not because they don't have enough, but because they're convinced they need more."
145,"Because that ethos of ""A happy & healthy workforce is an efficient workforce"" has been lost. People are heavily overworked, despite overworking being harmful to actual productivity. Vital professions are shat on and get their funding scraped to the barest of bones, and are then blamed themselves when everything goes tits up."
146,"Also, the more he boosts the village's quality of life, the easier it'll be to convince people on Tsukasa's side to defect. It really is effective from multiple angles."
147,Meanwhile my house still have no power heating   sob  
148,"i think the animator forgot to put in ""Stove Acquired"""
149,He needs the coal ash so making a stoveheater was just a small detour on getting that material. Also just in time for winter. Senku is not a heartless man...  remembers spartan creating session with the village  ...probably.
150,     Dr.Feels at it again
151,"I guess this means they didn't even have simple fireplaces before in the houses, which is a little surprising"
152,Theres a scene during the introduction of the village a family having a meal inside the hut with a campfire
153,"     Me too! As a maker, this hit a bit too close to home and I can attest that the sentiment is very real.    It can be a very isolating hobby if no one around you understands what you're doing, but on the other hand, it's infinitely more fun when you find like minded people."
155,Hahahahaha    yes.
156,S H I M A T T A
157,Whoopsie
158,"Considering that looks a lot more like a radio than a phone, maybe not"
159,"Well, yes, but you would still need a second radio, right?"
160,"Depends if you're aiming for bidirectional communication or more of a broadcasting style system. For bidirectional, I think they would. For broadcasting they just need receivers which should be easier to make and I'd think they'd have made some initially."
161,"To really get the benefit, they'd need two-way capabilities."
162,Not if the main radio is high enough to see the full battle field.
163,Which it seems with the observatory...
164,The observatory is no where in line of sight of tsukasa. Weren't they planning on taking the fight to him instead of waiting?
165,"that will be the main antenna that receives and sends signals, the others will have more portable radios with just enough signal strength to reach that antenna"
166,"yep, this is the big boi rebroadcasting tower"
167,"I think that this is a receiver transmitter, and thry need to build the other one."
168,Imagine if they turned it on and they immediately got an incoming call though.
169,"""Hello this is the IRS"""
170,“We’re calling to inquire about the missing 3700+ tax return you have yet to file.”
171,"""New world who dis?"""
172,"""FCC Calling. Shut down your illegal broadcasting equipment or we'll send in our  army of lawyers"" "
173,We're calling you about your cars extended warranty
174,"Hallo. We are finding suspicious activities on your social security number. Please to be giving us your informations so we can fix, and don't have to deactivate your social security number."
175,   You have one missed call from Scam Likely   
176,OHAIIOO SEKAIIIII 
177,"They need to make more transceivers, but this is meant to be the ""radio tower"""
178,"Huh, they're doing it proper cell phone style instead of walkie talkie style? I figured that having a central cell tower would be a bad move as it means they have one big target that if taken down shuts down their entire communication network, while a decentralized solution would be harder to take down.    Guess it'd be more resistant to stolen phones though."
179,"The enemy doesnt even know the existance of the radio tower, so being taken down is unlikely.    Tsukasa will probably realize whats going on when things start going wrong, but even then they will be too busy to deal with anything else"
180,"They don't know of it  yet , but it should be found out as soon as anyone is seen with a phone or until Tsukasa notices how coordinated they are and deduces that they must have phones. After that point, Tsukasa seems smart enough that he should have some idea of where to look for it."
181,I think everyone is forgetting that Tsukasa's group all come from the modern age and understand technology unlike the village
182,"And they already know they have Homura, another modern day person, watching everything they do. Maybe she wouldn't have recognized that pile of parts for what it is, but then they painted the words SENKU'S PHONE on it."
183,"When I saw the giant label saying SENKUS PHONE, I thought “well this might bite them in the ass later”    The enemy would probably be looking around for the means of communication and spot that giant label and be along the lines of “Hey, that was easy”"
184,"I mean, they're probably gonna torch it anyways. They already torched the village once. What's busting some weird machine?"
185,"Or they might see it and get impressed by how advanced Ishigami Village is, and join Senku?"
186,"Could also just be a repeater to amplify the signals of smaller, more portable devices."
187,"If they just want something that can receive the sound, it's actually really easy. You remember those salt crystal things they made? They can pick up vibrations emitted by the radio. So all you have to do is put one of those things inside of a megaphone, and bam. It would take all of two seconds.    EDIT: Here's a modern-day version of a rochelle salt speaker. It's stupidly easy to build: "
188,"I don't know, one of those could be too small, what if an enemy stole one without their knowledge?"
189,"Technically speaking, the enemy wouldn't need to steal one, they'd just need to make some rochelle salts of their own. They're painfully easy to make."
190,"They're kinda dumb though. I mean I didn't know how to build one of those things, and I'm slightly less dumb than most."
191,"In that case, they wouldn’t know to steal a rochelle salt in the first place. Who would imagine that all you need to build a speaker is some salt?"
192,        
193,"Just taping the salt to the back of the paper cup would have been enough. It would just be super quiet, which is fine since they would hold the cup up to their ear anyways.    The wires connecting the cup just amplified the signal."
194,But how will they remotely send messages?
195,They'll need two if they want to have two-way communication.
196,"Yeah, this is a plot twist for the villagers."
197,Same that memereaction for next week.
198,If only someone they want to try to have contact with happened to have some sort of device that can output sound and can be retrofit into a receiver.
199,The gorilla pun never gets old.    Specially if you consider Kohaku hides a 6-pack under that slender body of hers
200,Kohaku and Maki from Fire Force on the same day. Gorilla Friday is the best day of the week.
201,And soon its coming to an end..     shatteredsaten
202,"lol a non-slender body would hide a 6 pack, a slender body ""revealing"" the six pack is the reason it can b seen when you're low body fat;     ;    but I guess u mean the rest of her doesnt look particularly muscular, but everyone has the ab muscles haha"
203,"Yep, basically everyone has a six pack somewhere under their skin, the question is if they're thin enough for it to show through."
204,"Or if it's bulky enough, of course!"
205,"Not at all, you can have the bulkiest core muscles ever but they're not gonna show if you have fat on top of them."
206,I think the only exception I remember is Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin. You can see some good abs in some training scene.
207,"We have seen her in a bikini, she doesn't have a 6 pack. Just another example of the usual anime trope of portraying strong girls without actually having toned musclesfire force is a nice exception."
208,"To be fair, healthy people aren't toned. Rigid tone comes from being fit  and  dehydrated. Otherwise you just end up with hard muscles  under  a little squishy fat."
209,"Realistically, she would look as fit as Maki, maybe more buff, but the Bochi has a very unusual way of drawing girls."
210,If this was realistic then kohaku would be weaker than all the fit boys simply because she is a girl.    Luckily we don't have to follow what is realistic.
211,"O H , S H I K S     P H A C K"
212,"Wait, pun? How is the gorilla thing a pun?"
213,Wait where is the 6 pack? So far we haven't see her belly
214,Schrodinger's abs.
215,That PPAP reference with Gen lmao

217,I thought it was familiar
218,Oh is that what that scene was referencing?    That's awesome!
219,It was hilarious
220,I totally missed what when watching the first time lmao
221,That was a PPAP reference???
222,"I've only known Grandpa Kaseki for 12 episodes, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone and then myself."
223,Kaseki is actually Senkuus strongest ally.  The dude is insanely talented.
224,Without him they'd be dead to Tsukasa.
225,"They also wouldn't have been able to make the Sulfa drug at all no gas masks, centrifuge or complex glasswork."
226,"Exactly. Senku might have the knowledge necessary but that doesn't mean he can actually make the equipment on his own- it would have taken him and extreme amount of time to do the most basic glasswork or even woodwork as we have seen him trying to make that part for a gear from a tree trunk some eps ago, and yet without them he would not be able to do anything.     ;    Kaseki is really a power ally"
227,"Senku would need to find a way to call Yuzuriha back somehow, and whatever plan he had would be a bust."
228,"Agree, i would rank Kaseki  "
229,"Just like Senku has a supernatural intellectmemory, Grandpa Kaseki has supernatural craftsman skills"
230,Thats why Best Boy = Kaseki and Best Girl = Gen
231,You misspelled Gin.
232,Old age might be his worst enemy but he still has the body of somebody 50 years younger.
233,Isn't he 50...?
234,He is 50 years older than SenkuChrome so he's in late 60s probably
235,He's TECHNICALLY younger than Senku.
236,I was half expecting Senku to bring that up when Kaseki asked if they consider him their friend despite being over 50 years older than them
237,"It almost would have been funner if Senku said something like ""Even though you're 3000 years younger, you're still my friend"""
238,That rock wrapping treatment just did wonders to his skin is all.
239,"people died before their 50s in middle age.    Remember, before Senku arrived, they were mostly hunter-gatherer so a lot pre middle age society."
240,"Obligatory: ""That's a misconception.""    Dying during childbirth was much higher at that point in time skewing the average life expectancy.  If a person made it past early childhood, their odds of making it to old age weren't much worse than modern people."
241,"If you can be pedantic, I can also be pedantic and please don't take this as condescending:         That is so wrong between disease, famine and war.    We live in an absolutely unprecedented age of prosperity."
242,"It helps that Kaseki is also a craftsman, and not someone who regularly has to put their life on the line for their work.    That's actually why ""Smith"" is the most common English last name, because the blacksmiths were the ones who got to stay safe during wartimes while everyone else had to go out and fight. Likewise, ""Pikeman"" is one of the rarest last names specifically because pikemen were the frontlines of most battles."
243,That makes sense. Thanks for the info
244,"Nope, people would die at certain thresholds. If you'd reach 50 there was a good chance that you'd get to 70-80."
245,"Many did, yes. All of them? Most certainly not."
246,"The man is too precious man, makes me miss my Grandfather even more :"
247, My little swole craftsman grandpa      wow
248,Don't cry Santa :
249,Kaseki wanting a high five and being happy is the single best moment of this whole manga  anime.
250,"Science doesn't discriminate. The myopic, the aged, the ill, the infirm... all can benefit... and contribute... just as much as the career scientist. Race, religion, creed? Build, sender, sexuality? The more eyes on a problem from different perspectives means more possible solutions.    Science is the equalizer."
251,swolesome
252,It gave the manga art justice
253,That made me go from giggling to sad in a whole two seconds..      RIP grandpa..  
254,"Same, tho I never met mine :"
255,This could actually be a Light Novel title.
256,99
257,We are all merely living in his baller world.
258,   Sob    I don't want this show to end.
259,End of season period is always depressing
260,I know this pain so well and yet I keep subjecting myself to it.    MORE!
261,Miyazaki was right after all. Anime was a mistake
262,Probably every person watching right now feeling same! We want more after next week
263,Guess I'll have one less thing to look forward to on the Fridays after next week    I hope they announce the sequel soon.
264,"There is so much more! I'd bet 10000% on a season 2. Even in that miniscule case someone in the Production Comitte HAETS science, the manga runs every week in Jump and is EVERY BIT as awesome."
265,"Season 2 is probably already on its way.    Jump Festa is just around the corner, after all."
266,I hope so.
267,"People probably won't have to wait until Jump Festa. There'll be a big announcement in Jump next week complete with color spread and everything. As it'll release right after the end of season 1 in Japan Ends on Friday, Jump releases on Monday chances are good. Plus, it'll probably leak the day before the final episode."
268,"I'd be shocked if it wasn't.    I read the manga, and they don't have the time to squeeze everything into the next twenty minutes."
269,What do you mean everything? The mangas ongoing of course they can't
270,"I mean for this arc. Everything they actually  do  with the cellphone now that they have it would require two episodes or more, to say nothing of the conflict with Tsukasa."
271,I've taken this show for granted. I always watch it when I come home from work and before hitting the gym and it's gonna be so weird not having that after next week.
272,Same here. It signals the end of the week for me. Getting home to relax with new chapters and episodes
273,"They could've finished the arc with one more cour, I think.    Source: several weeks ago I got impatient and finished the arc."
274,"   Plastic  !    I am gonna explain in details how they did do it because they skipped about most of the stuff for the viewers which is appreciated.    So The reason they needed coal is not just to burn it, Senku want to extract something called   Naphtha  . It's a flammable hydrocarbon chemical. They extract it from Coal distillation. Naphtha is used as a catalyst to start the reaction of plastic making.    So the next thing they want is a monomer A single unit that will form a long chain of a monomers that would be called a Polymer. The most common monomer is Ethylene   C2H4  , they did get it from dehydrating wine those crystals are Ethylene Basically sugar crystals, now they just carry on with the reaction, Naphtha is further decomposed thermally and separated utilizing the difference in the boiling point temperature at which the phase change from liquid to gas occurs to form ethylene. Boom! plastic baby.    The thing with refining Tungsten is beyond what I know. But I did a fast research to see what I can get.    It's Calcium Tungstate CaWO4 or CaO4W it falls into the Scheelite category. Senku used ammonia to extract it from the ore. He first must make Ammonium Paratungstate:         The next step is just to make it powder, which is init self a long process that requires a lot of heating and Senku used it right when he make heating out of it. Although it's not safe lol.       The blue oxide is then reduced by hydrogen to metallic tungsten powder in stationary furnaces at temperatures ranging from 550 to 850 C 1,025 to 1,550 F. In this process the oxide is loaded into “boats” made of Inconel, a nickel-based alloy noted for its strength at high temperatures. These are stoked into tubes, usually arranged in two rows, and the tubes are heated in three separate zones along their lengths.    APT may also be reduced by carbon, although the powder is usually contaminated with tungsten carbide and some mineral elements contained in the carbon. When APT and carbon are mixed and reacted at 650–850 C 1,200–1,550 F, the product is a blue oxide. When heated in the range of 900–1,050 C 1,650–1,925 F, the brown oxide is formed. For complete reduction to metal, a temperature higher than 1,050 C is required. The purity of the metal is about 95 percent.    That's what I got from how to refine Tungsten from ore, I just read it all, and boy I am glad I am not working in chemistry section, let me play with physics lmao."
275,Thanks Mecha senku
276, Mecha Senku
277,Thanks Senku
278,"     I still don't understand why they need plastic. Sure, plastic is light and durable, but the housing could be anything, the coil could wrap around anything nonconductive, wires would be fine for connecting components, etc."
279,I think they needed it for the microphone too.
280,"Yeah, I think the material need they had there was ""light weight, rigid, thin, and durable."" Glass would be a bit too heavy or brittle, plastic can vibrate easily with little pressure, without breaking."
281,"I'm not sure why they're using bakelite, especially since you need a bakelizer to make it properly.    Without a bakelizer most attempts to make bakelite will just produce a pink foam."
282,Does the heating apparatus they used for the plastic making act as a convincing substitute for a bakelizer?
283,You tell me.
284,yeah the difference is the bakelizer you showed is a commercial one optimized for mass production.
285,The Bakelizer prevents the resin from foaming by using pressure.
286,"To make a contact microphone Using the piezoelectric properties of Rochelle salt you don't  need  plastic, you could probably get away with some textile.     Honestly it makes more sense to me that way since they're likely going to be used as throat mics anyway."
287,"Bakelitethe plastic they made is relatively easy in its components to make, as well as was heavily used in the early 20th century in the fledgling electronics industry due to its extremely high resistance to heat, electrical conductivity, and chemical action. As well as now they can produce a myriad of different electronics, and luxuries with it such as better glasses frames, buttons, lamps, etc"
288,"Plastic is an insulator. With unregulated energy, considering they're probably using direct current, rather than alternating current. Having plastic as an insulator helps a ton to keep people from shocking to death. That's pretty much what I thought it was."
289,"I don't think the voltage involved is enough to hurt people, but a short-circuit would prevent the radio from working."
290,"Did you see the batteries they have? Cause those are some massive batteries, with energy that has no safety nets. At least, not the same nets we have now. Do you know what direct current does compared to alternating current? Direct current is dangerous because it causes the body to freeze up due to the electric shock, which unfortunately prolongs the exposure to the wiring or power.  Alternating current does not, which is why if you stick your finger in a outlet, you can pull out your finger.        It also, like you say, stops it from short circuiting. Which is definitely an important thing, seeing as they don't have the time or resources to make another one. This is their only chance, after all."
291,"     I would say that AC and DC does not matter, as long as the current is more that 0.1A 100mA and it goes through you, you're good as fucked. That is why from where I live, a 30mA RCCBresidual current circuit breaker is required for every residential household. Upon detecting a residual leak of 30mA or more, it just trips, therefore protecting whoever was unlucky enough to touch the equipment. If you stick 2 fingers in to both live and neutral, you'll probably trip the RCCB while getting some shock. Stick one finger in and it does nothing, as you have not completed the electrical loop.    You can run 230Vac through the body and still be fine. I know a few people who daisy chained themselves and ran a couple of volts during lab sessions. Wearing safety shoes and standing on rubber mats, with supervision of course. Assuming 100,000 ohm per humandry, 230V100,000 x 4 = 0.000575 A. Which is 0.058 mA. They did not feel anything at all.      The part where bakelite is being used to prevent electric shocks should be correct. It is, after all, low in conductivity. I'm also guessing structural, weight and mold issues if you were to have wooden cases around."
292,They need it for the circuit board. I guess you could consider making it out of wood but it probably would be much harder because of how small the pieces need to be.
293,Chemistry is just playing math with rocks. And the more info we get from physics boys the more stuff we can cook up. Huzzah this show is motivational!
294,"Here I was thinking Senku is unrealistic not because of his science but because of his retention of knowledge, and here you come taking all that info out of your ass.... How do you people do it? Are you even ningen-desu"
295,I had the exact same reaction LMAO
296,Yes.
297,So these are all plausible?
298,"Yes they are, but they need hella amount of work to do. In the anime it was skipped and a little bit simplified not that much. If you want to do it in your backyard, you can but it wouldn't be perfect 'cause of little things mixed with it from the air and stuff."
299,so honey  then burn then more honey  visible confusion 
300,"     Haha, my thoughts exactly. Am in constant awe about how much Chemists can remember."
301,"        It's interesting to me, as a plant operator in a chemical plant that makes 40+ metric tonshr of polyethylene, what kind of primitive methods they used to accomplish it. I could go into great detail on how our low pressure gas phase reactor works to turn ethylene gas +11 secret herbs and spices into polyethylene resin and all the other factors that go into its creation, but I had no idea that wine would leave behind crystals containing ethylene and so never thought they'd be making plastic that easily. Senku really knows everything."
302,"Ooooh, now please explain how the furnace that Chrome made to heat the tungsten paste works!"
303,This can already be a filler episide
304,hi i am currently studying polymere engineer at university.     they actually used those crystals from the wine to make Rochelle salt which produce elektricity when hit by sound and not plastic.    additionally wouldn't ethylene just give you polyethylene+ they would need to build a reaction chamber to get a polymerisation going? Senku said they want to make bakelit which is a resin u get from a condensation of phenol and formaldehyd. it was actually used as a casing for the first home-telephones. i am actually currently studying for a exam in polymere chemistry and i finished the chapter about resins and the name bakelit sounded familiar.
305,"Weren't the sugar crystals used for the Rochelle salts? The bakelite was made with coal, sodium hydroxide and something else - with formaline as a precursor, and bakelite anyway is polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, not polyethylene.    Also the crystals weren't sugar, but potassium bitartrate."
306,"I am pretty sure that dehydrating wine gives Ethylene.. and yes the sugar crystals potassium bitartate are the one who were used to make Rochelle salts. Although polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride or Bakelite is what we were told that he did in the anime, but I am seeing contradiction for what happened in the anime and what is said to be. Yes Bakelite making is very similar for Polyethylene making, but they need different things. It might just be a mere confusion for me though, you might be right... Chemistry isn't my play ground anyway, it's physics."
307,"I'm a physicist too, I'm just going off what they did. I think if they say it's bakelite that's what it is, they've done their research until now, it'd be strange to make such a blunder. Besides bakelite truly is history's first plastic, so it makes sense it should be easier to synthesise than polyethylene, despite one might think the contrary. Besides, all they could get is LDPE, which is pretty crappy as a material; HDPE can not be produced without specialised catalysts."
308,"Naphtha is pretty darn good catalyst, and he surely done that by just distilling coal tar. I don't know, I need to do more research next time, what I said was what I all had. But seems there are easier plastic to make than polyethylene, I though that's was the easiest."
309,"Naphta certainly isn't a catalyst for the Ziegler-Natta process, which is what I was referring to:    Ziegler-Natta catalyst"
310,"damn, they speedrunned the last parts of making cell phones, I like how everyone was amazed when they didn't even test it if it works"
311,who they gonna call?
312,... ghost busters?
313,The Doctor?
314,"Did Kohaku just ""ok boomer"" her dad?"
315,"Wait until they get the first children born in the age of science for some serious disconnect.    ""You better eat all your food, you don't know how lucky you have it! When I was your age, we didn't have agriculture! We just went out there and actually hunted and gathered everything we needed to survive!""    ""Yeah, yeah, sure, mom..."""
316,Except hunting and gathering is far superior to agriculture. Agriculture fucking sucks dude.
317,"Agriculture is what allows civilization. Agriculture leads to cities, which leads to society, which leads to division of labor, which allows some people to work on actually progressing civilization."
318,"He's not wrong. The hunter-gatherer life provides a substantially higher standard of living than agrarian production. It isn't until you reach industrialization that civilized people start living healthier, longer lives than hunter-gatherers. And prior to modern sanitation, cities were cramped, dirty, polluted, disease-ridden cesspools. Only the wealthy enjoyed the benefits; everyone else got a worse deal than the ""uncivilized""."
319,"No shit, but you're confusing cause and effect. The need for cities gave rise to agriculture. H&G is far more productive and time effective food generation method. What it is not is LAND effective. If you are not land limited, you should not do agriculture."
320,But H&G groups weren't advancing science. That takes specialists who can't spend time on their basic needs and need others to provide them. A H&G group can't support those dead weights. The specialists also need many and they need to be concentrated so they can collaborate. Life did take a quality dive in the transition but it them bloomed into our modern society.
321,That's not true. HG is more time effective than early farming. You can absolutely support lots of dead weights so long as you have enough resources. Obviously enough resources doesn't exist anywhere in the scale necessary to support cities.
322,"sigh silly argument, the only thing that matters in the long run is number of people. the more people you have, the more likely one of them is euclid, which means cities are always better"
323,"Except there are no cities you dumb fuck, they have literally 50 people."
324,lel have you ever found yourself inside a cage in a zoo?
325,"Why are they booing? You're right.    With their population still low, they don't need agriculture."
326,"Well, early on it does, but if it’s industrialised it’s much more productive if not better at the individual lifestyle level."
327,"Well yeah, though ""early on"" is 99% of the history of agriculture. Agriculture only stopped sucking when people didn't have to do agriculture."
328,We do still do it though. It was us moving to agriculture that let us then move everyone out of it. There is no way to modernize H&G to the point it can sustain massive cities.
329,"     No, machines do for the most part. We just direct them and then let them do the work.         The people in this show don't have to follow history. They can skip steps because they already have the knowledge.     They can just be H&G until they have a need for agriculture and then straight away create advanced farming tools."
330,"Even during the Stone Age, they have meme."
331,You can thank best dad Byakuya and his 100 Stories for that.
332,Byakuya knowing what aspects of civilization should be preserved the most     gintamathispleasesme
333,Memes and incest
334,Dude must’ve played his fair share of crusader kings.
335,Poor guy browsed animemes too much
336,Damn beat me to it
337,"We have records from ancient greece on having conflict of generations and surely it should go much further in past. If we go far enough, even first words spoken by humans could had same meaning as ""ok boomer""."
338,I find it so hilarious that the villagers are getting attached to the idea of science while having such a loose understanding of what it is. At some point Senku is going to have to sit people down and explain why it isn't magic.
339,The tech tree is messed up. Having sulfa drugs before a stove seems kinda off
341,I know! I teared up when i saw it
342,"I saw the panel shared a while back so I knew what was coming, but I still teared up"
343,It's like he's crying molten tin.
344,its becsuse the artist didnt draw the details youd see through the tears and didnt include any indication of reflection from a light source.
345,That excellent thick lines of that portrait  gave it justice
346,OHAYO SEKAI GOOD MORNING WOOOOORLLDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
347,"that caught me complete off guard, thought the episode was ending and they are playing the first op instead of the ed"
348,"Yeah, same. I just went on to do something else while it played in the background, but then a bit in I heard talking and thought ""oh wait, there's more?"". I blame that the first shot as the music started playing just made it look like normal credits."
349,"yeah like what gives, they sang ""good morning world"" then literally showed a picture of the world.  I instantly assumed that was credits."
350,They're already using the opening song? But what happens if Tsukasa is about to defeat them and Senku needs to power up.
351,they can always use it twice like they did in black clover. didn't work so well the 2nd time though...
352,What were the 2 times in BC. I remember one was episode 100 but what was the other?
353,Asta vs vetto
354,Thank you i just completly blanked
355,They still have the second op available!
356,     He has a brain and science. Senku doesn't need a power up.
357,"They are gonna use the 1st ending, that guitar will hit us when we least expect it."
358,Talk about friendship or some shit.
359,I believe there is a very good OST very fitting on that Scenario. Ive  listened to the whole soundtrack
360,         dore hodo aruitarou         dore hodo aruitarou
361,     Ashi no itami dake ga
362,I’m not ready for this to not be a staple in my life.
363,I have absolutely no idea what part of that is a phone or how they are making more than one but I am not gonna question it.    Edit: I just realized there is only 1 episode left...     panic
364,"Based on the part right at the end of the episode, I have a feeling that this is more of a cell tower sort of thing. Really they should have called it a radio or something rather than a cell phone."
365,"Yeah, but if they called it a radio, taiju wouldn't have wanted it"
366," Builds a radio     ""Hey Taiju, here's that cellphone you wanted.""    ""Umm... Senku. This doesn't look like the iPhone I ordered...""    ""It's the latest model.""    ""Oh ok."""
367,     Technically not wrong...
368,"You need ""courage"" in making that... phone... thing"
369,He only needs to charge an exuberant amount of money for it and it'll be indistinguishable from a real Apple product anyway.
370, exorbitant
371,I decide to not double check with a dictionary  once  and this is what I get.     imdone
372,H-... have you ever used an Apple product?
373,"Yeah, they're good, but a tad bit overpriced."
374,Waiting for an episode where they invent justice system for Taiju to sue Senku for false advertising.
375,My impression is that they have called it a cell phone because they thought this would be most relatable to the younger audience. Radio amateurs are not that common among WSJ readership probably.
376,"That's probably the most logical reason for it. I feel like radios aren't ""that old"" yet, but who knows. I'm only 25, but to be fair, i probably wouldn't have thought of radios as big boxes with antennae very often in comparison to like walkie talkie radios if it weren't for my grandpa being a radio operator."
377,"Well I guarantee if he'd said ""radio"" instead of ""cell phone"" you'd have far less drive to read the next chapter, right? It's already obviously not a cell phone because it can't be transported like one, which I think of as the key component of a ""cell phone"""
378,"no, not really."
379,"I put it down to radio seeming much more attainable of a goal than a phone, while the overlap between the two is enough to be acceptable. So for marketability claiming it'll be a phone is more impressive"
380,"I kind of disagree with you on that. So far the show hasn't strayed away from scientific terminology that people might not know. They do a pretty good job at explaining it too in an easily understood way when the time comes for using it. I imagine that the episode it gets used for the first time, they will explain the physics of whats going on with it."
381,"Well I assume they are making something with two way communication instead of just a broadcasting station, so calling it a phone would be more accurate."
382,Radios can be two-way too. Armies have field radios for the same purpose that Senku wants this one for.
383,They probably called it that way because a lot of kids have never seen a radio or a normal telephone.
384,Way to make my hip hurt. I wonder what kind of basic pieces of technology I've never heard of because they were obsolete by the time I was a kid...?
385,"Here's a short list.    Probably the most notable one would be punch cards, which I mostly know about because everyone over 50 keeps bringing them up whenever I mention anything to do with computers."
386,     Oi fuck you
387,"Considering the length of the list, some of the items on it are oddly specific"
388,     How long did it take you to become a kid? I was born one myself.
389,It took roughly 4.543 billion years before I was a kid.
390,That’s quite a bit of technology you missed out on
391,"That's my point. We know about stuff like record players, spinning jennys, and castles, but how much weird shit like in this video do we not even know we don't know about?"
392,Baby cages! God this guy is hilarious
393,So what are they gonna do with the receiver?
394,build a sender as well? and give it to whoever does their scouting?
395,I'm guessing they're making something like this.
396,"It’s the bare basics. One of the best things about advancing science and technology is minimizing things, making them more compact and portable. The first computers took up entire rooms, now they can fit in your pocketSmartphones."
397,     To get the same processing power as the early computers you only need a millimeter-scale SoC. A smartphone by comparison is a Tesla vs a horse and buggy.
398,"Funnily enough, we had electric cars in the same era that we used horse and buggies. Electric cars lost to steam and fuel driven cars though."
399,I don't see how that's going to fit into your pocket unless you're a Minecraft character.
400,villager from animal crossing
401,They just need to make some pants with huge pockets. Which might as well be an opportunity to introduce the village to the spinning jenny.
402,"That antenna thing is literally an antenna, the receiver is probably inside the box. The manganese batteries I assume are kind of like an internal battery, while the liquid ones are there so the manganese doesn't get wasted before they need to use it?"
403,"No, the manganese batteries are needed for the high voltage terminal on the vacuum tube. The other lead-acid batteries are for the main power source and heating element."
404,Thanks!
405,"For me it's the ""cell"" part that I don't see lol They really should have said they were building a radio or something, this is not a cellphone by any stretch of the imagination."
406,Looks similar to those WW1 radios
407,and it looks like ww1 squad photo
408,"I was so confused when I saw that thing. It was nowhere near the old radio phone I know. Then the rod ""electrified"" the whole landscape and it hits me:  This is like a cellular towertransmitterreceiver thing isn't it?. Wait, That is still nowhere near the phone I know! "
409,"It could be  part  of the phone you know though, if the plan is to make it work as a cell tower."
410,"when I watch the episode, I might be able to explain a little bit of whats going on with it. I work as an engineer for antennas and had another job making and testing Power Amplifiers for cell phones. My guess is that they are making an omni antenna that can do both transmit and receive, then using a series of tube amps to amplify the RF signal so that it can be transformed back to audio. Since there shouldn't be any other RF flying though out that area, they probably wont have to worry much about filtering out any out of band noise and just deal with the noise of the signal which, I think tube amps have a pretty good linear amplifying range with low noise amplification. Which is why they are used in amps for guitars and what not still. I could be wrong on that though. I would expect the audio to be pretty choppy though and that it will be hard to hear the other person clearly. My question though is how are they going to get another one of those built and delivered north, without detection and more importantly, without damaging the tube amps. they are really sensitive to vibrations...really really sensitive to vibration."
411,     It's likely a broadcasting station and they just need to make receivers.
412,"I gotcha     the center part is an antenna, the radio tower everyone is talking about, bellow it there is a master switch and a vacuum tube to control the flow of current    To the right those are batteries, different from the ones Gen was making. Those ones are probably stronger batteries meant to power the antenna, see how they are connected in series?, that's what you do when you want to increase the voltage in a circuit. Individual radios will be able to work with the manganese-zinc batteries but we are yet to see those in action    For the record, radios are easy to make, they used to make them in literal bread boards, you just need those crystals, an antenna and a couple of transistors, if you are close enough to the radio tower you might not even need batteries    To the left is the actual circuit, have you seen pictures of those old switchboards in which operators would connect and disconnect cables when people wanted to talk to each other?, this is that    That thing is probably made of vacuum tubes connected in such a way as to produce the simple logic gates that a radio needs. Knowing this show, Senku probably made it in such a way that changing who you are talking to just requieres switching one wire from place to place and Suika will do it    I'm not sure how they will know how to connect the calls though...    Anyway, I might be wrong, electronics is not my strong-suit"
413,"This is probably a super simple cellphone that converts eletricity and mechanical waves into metallic sound, there was something simillar in a science museum i've went, basically you would talk and you would receive the awnser across a yard metal trough vibrations."
414,"Mom, can we have a cell phone.    We have cell phone at home.    Cell phone at home."
415,"I had to do a double take near the end when the first OP started playing. I thought for a moment that this was the last episode. Can't wait for next week, hope S2 is confirmed."
417,I just realized making a phone is basically like crafting the Terra Blade from Terraria.
418,More like the cell phone
419,More like crafting the ankh shield
420,"Nah it's more like the Cell phone. Most of the stuff isn't too bad to get if you know what you're doing, but then you have that FUCKING fisherman and his bullshit RNG once a day drop BULLSHIT that means that nobody actually gives enough of a shit to get it legit."
421,I got the achievement for completing 200 fishing quests before I got all three parts I needed from him. The game was lucky I loved fishing.
422,"     I feel attacked.    ""It's just question of grinding and it will eventually drop, maybe I should just put it in my Character and when it drops I'll delete it"""
423,"I took the time to stockpile a large amount of quest fish using the safebank trick, but still ended up save scumming for the cell phone quest rewards."
424,I just use save editors once I got all the other pieces normally. There's no reason to waste so much time on them.
425,"No save editors on consoles!     However, I used a save editor to ""transfer"" my post Moon Lord character over to the PC version, since the Switch is still pre 1.3.4 meaning no Old One's Army, no Tavern Keep, and a whole bunch of other good stuff.     I want to go back to playing on my Switch, but I just can't stand the delayed updates."
426,"Was about to say, lol."
427,Or even better: the phone from Terraria
428,Or like those very endgame weapons from calamity mod
429,"Or like the  ""Exo Blade"" from Calamity, a Terraria mod."
430,I love how they keep using Godzilla to represent how heat resistant tungsten is.      Well this just shows how confident Senku is in his friend's abilities as a scientist. Letting him take care of this project on his own without needing to help him. And that was also some heartwarming sentiment given to Kaseki there.      Everybody wants some high fives.      And Gen gets his own musical montage... o-kay... but then it was followed up by one using the first op so it all evens out.
431,           Pretty much the currency of the science kingdom.
432,"Evens out? I think you meant to say ""makes it even better""."
433,"When they were talking about having maker friends, I was like ""This is so heartwarming.. When are Old Man Kaseki's clothes ripping of--YEP THERE IT IS""    The new hit Manganese Rice Balls is the hottest track of the 58th century, could warm up the whole village with that fire    How exactly is that a cell phone? Though they haven't explained it yet, that seems more to me like a cell phone  tower . Which if that's the case, that is NOT what I was expecting since they kept saying cell phone and not cell phone tower. Then again, this whole time I was wondering both how they were going to make portable enough cell phones  and  how they were going to get service for said phones.     I really hope they don't leave us with a massive cliffhanger for the final episode. I can't imagine a whole battle being resolved in 20 something minutes."
434,Their cellphone is basically walkie talkie. One with tower plus another one being portable military style
435,Is the central tower a repeater? That's the CB setup we use in school bus driving.
437,Learn how to spoiler tag.
438,"I don't tag it because it is not total spoiler.    Obviously after watching this episode, you can guess some of next episode"
439,"Doesn't matter what kind of spoiler you think it is , tag all spoilers."
440,Ok boss

442,I think they are aiming towards some sort of radio tower with little devices which can keep track those radio waves
443,It is basically an early radio. They still thousands of steps away from making real modern cell phone.
444,"Honestly, I think it's a translation issue, either from language to language or from generation to generation. Maybe ""keitai"" is just how the Japanese refer to any portable communications device. Or maybe Senku is so young he just doesn't know any other word for portable communications devices."
445,"     Literally means mobile, short for ketai denwa mobile telephone. And the roadmap shows a cellphone, maybe it's not what Senku's actually making, but if it's not, the cellphone analogy is clearly intentional. If Senku wanted to say ""transceiver"", he probably would have Toranshībā ."
446,"I don't think that's it, they keep also showing images of cell phones. My guess is this was a way to make it sound coolermore relatable to young readers."
447,"I like that the kingdom of science doesn't discriminate against age. Even if you're old or young, you can contribute."
448,Child labor and Elderly people with no retirement
449,"capitalism, ho!"
450,I mean Senku already has his own cellphone brand...
451,Lets just hope that his data plans are reasonable
452,I was not expecting a Recettear reference.
453,Truly the greatest invention of science.
454,"It took a petrifying beam to remove all human from Earth and thousand years to reclaim the world from man made pollution. And Senku was just like, ha, Plastic! CO2 emission! I'm bringing the Gang back together!"
455,"I don't think a society like this, living in straw huts etc care a whole lot about the elderly..    If you can walk, see, hear and haven't gone senile, you can work.      And children gotta learn too, ain't no soccer practice or higher education in the Stone World lmao"
456,"Someyhing Tsukasa doesn't get about civilization is that's exactly how it works.        Pre industrial revolution those who couldnt work in the fields would work in food processing or textiles.  Look at traditional weaving for an example.  It's tedious, time consuming, and a suboptimal use of resources if you need food.   But if you have elderly folk who can do it, they can use it to make nets and ropes--among other things and thats a huge leap forward.  Part of the reason civilization and farming surpass hunter gathering is that it allows more people to contribute."
457,"No, he gets it. He totally gets it. It's why he's determined to nip it in the bud before it gets out of hand.    Civilization is wonderful for total production. But for reasons that are pretty much a mystery to the vast majority of people, it also has a tendency to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few, who can then use that power and wealth to concentrate it even further. What begins as people working together ends up in some form of servitude at a level of compensation that barely exceeds what could be had from the world by one's own hands, if only one could get hold of the necessary resources any more.    Tsukasa doesn't know what causes it; he only knows it is associated with modern civilization. He intends to prevent this by preventing or at least delaying for a few hundred years the emergence of civilization. He knows he can't beat Senku once he gets going. He needs to beat him ASAP. Tsukasa's growth is linear, Senku's is geometric. Tsukasa's advantage grows since he has the revival formula, but eventually Senku's will pass his."
458,"He's too much of an idealist to realize he doesn't understand.      Division of Labor is pretty much fundamental to being human, and to any pack or familial structure.  Even ants understand that organism are just better when working in concert.      Humans have two, or three basic desires.  Safety, Significance, and Sex.      It's not an uncommon sort of existential angst.  Thanks to science, safety is so easy that our needs for Significance, and Sex begin to carry a heavier weight  The petrification on the other hand, stripped away safety entirely, flipping the modern paradigm on its head.      Tsukasa, when he awoke and punched out a lion, was probably the happiest he'd ever been in his life.  Suddenly society fell in synchronization with his personal strengths.  He -wants- to be relied on.  As ""the strongest primate highschooler"" it's a validation of who he's always been, and who he's always been told he is.  That's why he formed the Tsukasa Empire rather than being a lone wolf, and really a great explanation for why he wouldn't just straight up kill Senkuu's friends after Senkuu ""died"".  He thinks they need him."
459,"The thing is,  he's not wrong  about the association of agrarianism and ultimately modernity with a vicious distribution of property. And ironically, given the stone world is populated entirely by people who either know no science at all, or are, or are descended from people who know well the physical sciences but have neglected the social ones, Tsukasa's solution is probably the best one available."
460,"Hunter gatherers also concentrate riches in a few. Or did you think that the biggest, strongest or just thr better hunter doesn't get the nicest thing and women?    What civilization does is allow for greater riches and more people. It allows us to stockpile beyond basic necessities. Taukasa wants to force people to be ""equal"" by making them equally poor."
461,"Senku doesnt care what age you are, as long as you can pump lots of air into the furnace."
462,"Damn it, Magma. They're minerals!"
463,tbf rocks are just a bunch of different minerals shoved together.
464,We require more minerals.
465,Legit cried for Kaseki. Such a wholesome moment there! And I am glad to see magma getting along with everyone.
466,"Love Gens singing part! So catchy, makes me actually want to learn that tiny bit so I can randomly sing it when working"
467,apparently it parodies PPAP.
468,"hmmm, listening to it again, i can see some similiarities but whatever. This is good on it's own ;D"
469,Mangan gangan 
470,"""Father is of an older generation...""     ahem  What Kohaku tried to say was:    Ok boomer"
471,   Stitches!      Science Buddies 1      Science Buddies 2      Emotional Kaseki      Ishigami Village Kids      Coal Gathering Team      Battery Making Team    Legit teared up during this scene. They've all been science buddies from the start!     I think this is the only show where I can get really hyped over tungsten filament.       Kaseki gets his walk away high five! High fives for everyone!    Well that got dark.      Gen's song about making batteries was hilarious! xD Also that was totally a Pikotaro reference.    The first OP playing caught me off guard! Love the montage though!    That looks more like a radio tower than an actual cell phone. I'm curious what the actual thing they'll give to Taijuu and Yuzu will look like!      Only 1 episode left! I really hope they'll announce Season 2 next week once the episode is over.
472,is there a trope page for that kind of high five? i've always described it as the sports anime high five. like 'cool guys dont look at explosions'
473,"Doesn't seem to be one, no."
474,Be the change you want to see in the world.
475,excellent stiches ! Kaseki best grandpa
476,The whole gang has been looking fresh as fuck in their winter outfits for the past few episodes
477,     Except for when someone falls asleep on fire watch.
478,"Wait, there is only one episode left. Oh no, this is gonna be a huge fucking cliffhanger finale."
479,"Based on the opening for the second half, I have a feeling of where the season is going to end. It's a little bit of a cliffhanger, but also a huge ""FUCK YEA!"" moment that should leave you satisfied enough until the second season"
480,"This entire episode is basically a set-up and preparation for coming big fight. In usual anime it's done only a few seconds of training montages, whereas in Dr. Stone they explains every details and it still entertains, the episode flies by and never fells dull.    What I liked in this episode is a few character development here and there like Kaseki or the ex-village chief, hell even I I can't remember his name but still impressed by the little conversation with Senku."
481,Kinro turned into Luffy for a second.
482,Ginro looks like he just had an icicle jammed up his arse.
483,"Oddly specific example, you talking from experience?"
484,Jojo reference
485,Old man Joseph had an interesting life.
486,"Lmao, why am i getting nostalgic over an OP that played like 2 months ago?"
487,That's how you know it is good shit.
488,Seeing Senku give every house a heaterstove was so fucking wholesome.
489,"I might be missing some things original Jurassic ParkEarly Michael Chricton deserve mentioning, but this show treats science so much better than any  sci-fifantasy TV show or movie I can think of.    It’s not just that the science is largely accurate if simplified.      it’s that it’s decidedly not tony stark waving holographic images around and breaking physics. Or scientists developing and producing  a new and possibly gene editing  super nano-robotvaccine in like 22 hours to miraculously cure a loved one.    The main thing this show emphasizes is that what science though one could argue this show is more a love letter to engineering is; is  basic principles and that lead you through trial and error and eventually after many failures produce results.    That it specifically went out of its way to highlight that scientific research yields secondary advantages is just the icing on the cake."
490,"THIS, a million times this    this show has changed how I see science fiction"
491,"Man, when I started reading this manga as it first started serializing chapter 11 or so I didn't think I would end up loving it so much. And the anime adaptation did such a good job with the OST, the openings, the endings and the animation... It's sad to know it'll end next week, but knowing what's ahead it'd be stupid if they didn't make season 2!    I really love the timelapses, the overall atmosphere reminds me of the time spent with my cousins by the beach...    And the science bits are great too. As a chemical engineering student that picked up this path without knowing what I was getting into, it helps me stay motivated and learn. If you like Dr. Stone and don't know what to do in the future, consider anything realated with chemistry, it can be as fun as it's depicted here! Although a billion times harder."
492,The adaptation and OST are excellent but some art and animation on certain episodes are kinda clunky
493,Did Kohaku just called her dad a boomer? Were not even a few min in the episode and already she insults him XD
494,Well he did treat her like shit for several years and was perfectly willing to let her sister marry an abusive asshole so i say she is entitled to some jabs here and there.
495,  WATASHI WA SMARTPHONE GA      Sure does feels like final episode. Is it mistake by the studio to show Homura along with Tsukasa's group since she's supposed to be spying on the Science Kingdom?
496,"It's pretty clear that it's just a ""these are the forces arrayed against us"" kinda shot, since there's one or two characters in there that I'm pretty sure haven't been properly introduced just yet."
497,"Amazing, gen's song was something i wasnt expecting but was a pleasant surprise"
498,This is one of the best anime for me. Cool way to apply science to an anime. Hoping for season 2 announcement soon.
499,Apparently the next issue of Shounen Jump will have a 'major' announcement for Dr. Stone so it could perhaps be as soon as next week.
500,Traditionally they do announce season 2 at the end of the season 1 finale if it's planned as an ongoing.
501,Best Maker Buddy
502,Tsukasa is out there playing Mount and Blade while Senku is playing Modded Minecraft.
503,I've always seen it as them playing a game of Civ.     Senku wants the science victory where his end goal is space. Tsukasa wants the domination victory.
504,damn ghandi winning always by war
505,     I'd go with Factorio.
506,"not really, Factorio is all about automation, while here there's exploration aspects etc"
507,Senku is playing Factorio.
508,This entire show is about an Industrialcraft player introducing Vanilla Minecraft players to the joys of science.
509,"omg laughed so hard at the scene of gen's silly song while he was making the batteries. at first when the funky beat started playing i was like ""wait what is this a new ost?"" but then gen opened his mouth and i died. also it's been 3 years since ppap lol time flies gen is really a top tier character and he never fails to entertain...like when he flips words around ""jima"" and ""doihi"" lolol and that one time he imitated tsukasa...NEVER CHANGE PLEASE GEN"
510,senku supports child labor
511,The old opening coming on towards the end gave me chills for some reason. Sad af we got 1 more episode this season.
512,Making those heaters and getting the children and elderly involved in a way that was both meaningful and satisfying is incredible. Senku learned that inspiration is more valuable than anything.     When Chrome went into the forest and made the waterwheel of his own volition things truly changed because Senku can now hopefully worry a little less that he is being too narrow or getting serious tunnel vision because will others can and will step up because he enabled them.    I love it and he is a better than the village could have ever dreamed of.
513,Also help them reduce carcinogen intake
514,Was there ever an Anime that used its first opening and the second opening in the same episode?
515,Iirc JoJo did it in the last episode of Part 2.
516,"is ""the jojo did it"" the anime counterpart of ""the simpson did it""?"
517,Don't forget the references that are make up 90% of both show's fandom
518,"Actually, the true form would be ""is that a JoJo's reference?"""
519,railgun played like 4 openings in a single episode
520,A lot.    It's not rare for a finale to play the first opening at some moment.
521,Black Clover used the first opening song in episode 100 and the current opening for the real opening
522,"Not gonna lie, when Good Morning World played again, I started tearing up. This show came out during some rough times I've had this year, from cutting out an extremely abusive person, to losing my father. This show is so full of hope, that even if I know a lot of what's gonna happen cause I binged the manga, it still made me wanna keep going and going along with Senku's adventures.      I'm gonna be real bummed out when it's over. Hopefully they announce season 2 just as fast."
523," Man this show and its feels        makicry      Melonlord likes telescops aww.  Shes a junior science user, train her well!      How long do we have before the war i wonder.      We are almost done!  Sprint time?  Oh yeah!  Science Montage!!      Magna joining the banter this is nice.  Hes eager to help.      Wait heat the tungsten inside the glass?  Oh shit.  And Monkey is gonna be doing it.  Nice.      Oldman is jelous of the bromance rivalry between Senku and Monkey.      AW OLDMAN HAS THEM TOO! MONEKY YOU SMOOTH TALKER!  LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS NOW, MY HEART       Of course sharkface has to help Senku since hes the only one who knows about modern stuff haha.      So magnifying glass plus heating up the base got them the hear they needed?      Lets see what Senku thinks.  Seems this will do it then.  Everyone can work together to finish it.      Oh damn a big vaccum pump out of glass.  Thats complicated as hell.      Sharkface is good at getting people to act.  Hes a real smooth talker.      OLDMAN JUST WANTED A HIGH FIVE!? HES SO PRECIOUS       MELONLORD WANTS TO BE USEFUL TOO AND GET A HIGH FIVE!? STOP I CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH!      Plastic, oh damn this will be tricky.  Seems Senku has a plan though.     Oh yeah Senku is cheif now so megane-kun will listen to him, he isnt restricted to guard duty only now!      Of course Senku makes heating for everyone while making his ashes too.  Damn hes a nice guy.      And the old Cheif seems really happy with Senku's actions, thats nice.      Sharkface is making something?  I guess he needs to start being more diverse.      WAIT A SONG!? AHHAHAHHAHAH MY GOD THIS IS HILARIOUS! 800!?  JESUS FUCK!      And now were onto the Mics, the last step!  Leaving Jane to do that?  Risky..      PHONES ARE DONE BABY! AW YEAH MONTAGE TIME!  AND HERE COMES TARZAN!"
524,     lmao
525,The Kaseki friend scene made me tear up in the manga months ago and got me again with this episode
526,"Did Kohaku really just ""ok boomer"" his father? What a mad lad"
527,Remember to treat your Legendary Master Crafting and Construction guy right.    Also that Pen Pineapple Apple Pen bit killed me.
528,I think I need more of Gen's singing in my life
529,"Really love how Senku left everyone with their projects, especially Chrome. Sure he was doing his chemistry but he also took the time to make an ovenfurnace to help the villagers survive the cold."
530,I love old man Kaseki.
531,Like Senku said to Chrome use everything you got. This episode totally used lots of that awesome OST throughout
532,"""Good morning world"" is finally in the second course guys!"
533,"when everyone pitches in for the kingdom. of science, that's the real climax right there. with kaseki and suika. then with the older generation, winter cold and starvation was a real problem before."
534,"This show always makes me want ramen.    Also Senku reminds me of people in tech companies trying to push for new tech they want to play with. ""we need phones to beat tsukasa. Yes I know guns would help too, but phones are more important. Goddamn it I just want to have a phone again!"""
535,"If my partner was Ruri I wouldn't mind doing that  shit for the rest of my life honestly    Also, Kaseki is a saint"
536,"I hope we'll actually get a season 2, and not a movie. I hate the trend of movies being sequels."
537,I doubt they could wrap up the next arc in one movie.
538,"Most anime: ""play the OP during a hype final battle!""    DR stone: ""play the original OP during a hype crafting montage""    damn i love this show so much, im actually gonna start reading it once it concludes"
539,OHIO SEKKAI was pretty nostalgic. Probs one of my fav OP's of the year
540,One cellphone. Now need  another  cellphone.
541,"I love how they play the first OP, build up to this picture of a smartphone, and then cut to them standing in front of this massive piece of unwieldy nonsense nobody in their right mind would think was a phone. Just funny."
542,Damn that episode was so good it felt like 5min.
543,"Felt like 40min , so much stuff happned"
544,"The way Senku was handing out those high-fives, has got me wanting one too."
545,"After that hype scene with GOOD MORNING WORLD they better give us a second season!    Actually, one of the things I'm more excited about is knowing this guy, I like his design so I wonder how's him like."
546,"  ""Mom, can we have cell phone.""      "" We have cell phone at home.""     Cell phone at home."
547,"You know, I'm amazed Senku didn't use the waterwheel to do the wire making process but I'm glad he didn't. The entire kingdom has to be invested.    Also, I want more of this. This is the kind of anime they could make 293084930489034890 episodes out of without it getting stale."
548,each episode would be 1 year's worth of humanity's discoveries
549,"Science 1010, civilization 110. These people have 0 farms, 0 architecture, 0 economy, 0 institution, 0 government, 0 real military. They dont even have sewage system. They are worse than ancient romans in everything other than science. They really need to revive some modern era human who will do this. This is like maxing only one ability in rpg game. They really need to start progressing as civilization else they will never get to modern era."
550,"4 real military, to be fair."
551,"They have only about 6 people who can fight with no ranks, base, camps, training for new recruits."
552,the main problem seems to be population; they don't have revival fluid.    that or inclusive the fact that they don't have an education system to teach and train people into more productive workers.
553,hopefully next episode they win and are able to get revival fluid from the caves. Modern people can teach the stone age people. And rebuild a lot faster depending on what was their past job.
554,"how large is their population, anyway?    are they in the 50's?"
555,idk but they are less than 100 for sure.
556,What really got me was when the old chief understood the true power of science when allowed to flourish. Each step allows for a new world of possibilities even if not intentional. Every thing Senku has needed has bettered the lives of the village. This theme started slow on the first episodes but on the last 3 you can really see how the momentum of each discovery building on top of the previous one has catapulted the quality of life of the village.
557,Senku the project manager.
558,I love all the music the show uses for the montages.
559,I hope someone does a compilation video of the montages. Just pure labor
560,"If it was so   called  cold outside, why didn't they just bring the wire-making indoors?  Even without indoor heating, just being surrounded by walls would make a large difference.    Nice to see the womenfolk in the stone age preserve the grand old Japanese tradition of going bare-legged in freezing temperatures.    I never knew Kinro ate the Gum Gum fruit.    Good to hear the OP1 song again. So superior to OP2's.    They didn't actually show anything of the stone age version of the ""circuit board"" did they?"
561,I don't get what you said about them bringing the wires inside. What do you mean?
562,"I mean they were freezing their asses and more, more importantly, hands by making the gold wires outside in the cold.  It would've been better to do the work inside even before the chimneys got added."
563,"Oh, you meant to say cold. Sorry, I was sleepy and didn't put two and two together."
564,"Ah, didn't even realize I'd made that typo.  Happens way too often in recent years."
565,"Zinc for seaweed ♪    Manganese rice balls ♪    Coal in the middle ♪    Look at that, a zinc-carbon battery ♪    Look at that, a zinc-carbon battery ♪"
566,"New phone, who dis?"
567,Was Gen singing a parody of PPAP pen-pineapple-apple-pen?
568,Yiss
569,"As great as it was here, I do think that Kaseki's moment when he was told he has friends just worked even better in the manga IMO. Here I felt it was a bit too quickly moved on from, and of course the art can't live up to this"
570,"Expectation : Smartphone    Reality : Radio    Sure, nobody was expecting them make an actual phone, though it would have made it a bit more reasonable if they stopped using the smartphone image for what they were building..."
571,"My worry is that so far, all of the sciencey stuff is getting done a little ways away from the village. Certainly, this will be Tsukasa's first target, as it's way more difficult to defend than the rest of the village which can be isolated fortress-style on the islands. Why not move the lab to the chieftain's island? There seems to be plenty of space there since a plaza exists for the succession ritual which can simply take place in another area on the mainland if need be."
572,"I wonder what they are going to do with the next episode. There's no way they can put the conclusion to this arc in just 1 chapter, there are a lot of things left that need to happen."
573,Maybe it will be the coveted unicorn hour special.
574,Yuzuriha and Taiju are in the op but we haven't seen them yet lol
575,Did something happen to the english Dub? It was originally 2 weeks behind the Sub but now nothing has come out for several weeks and its now 4 episodes behind and still no update?
576,"Last week's episode got delayed due to the holidays, both 20 and 21 are up now, so they're back on schedule. 24 will also be getting delayed a week for the same reason."
577,"OHAYO SEKAI, GOOD MORNING WORLD!"
578,"This episode adapted my absolute favourite scene in the whole manga and I've read literally every chapter available.    Senku leaving everything up to Chrome, and immediately thereafter Chrome saying Kaseki was just as important as either of them and Kaseki's reaction is the masterstroke of this entire story.    There are plenty of interesting parts still to come, but this particular moment in the manga really made me glad I read it.    I've heard some people are going to start reading the manga and I highly recommend it if you've enjoyed the anime so far. No offended to the animation team - the work is undeniably hard - but I don't think it can compare to how Boichi's art goes so high detail in key moments. The moment Senku made light for the first time was something awesome in the manga, while it was really just another scene in the anime, right?    Anyway, hope you all enjoy."
579,Ohayou sekai Good Morning World!!!
580,I don't know what It is about this show but I really love it.
581,"Gen represents the laziest of modern day humans, i love him having to make a song to get himself going through menial work."
582,They brought back goodmorning world
583,Gens song tho
584,"I haven't watched the series at all yet, but is next weeks episode the last one? I'm waiting to binge it all once.     Also is there another season coming out next year?"
585,10 billion percent chance of a Season 2 announcement next week.
586,"No announcement of a second season, but there will be plenty of material left for one, so my bet will be next week they announce like a summerfall season."
587,1 more episode left.  They say the 1st arc is a bit weak. Story starts to get wild at episode y and it just gets bettrr and better
588,Too bad they couldn’t make guns
589,They should at least make some tasersstun guns...
590,"Or evacuate the entire village at the end of winter, move FAR away to bumfuck Kyūshū and build the kingdom of science without having to fear an imminent barbarian invasion."
591,"Aww everything was awesome until the SENKU PHONE font was shown...    Why did they use that ""machine"" font instead of hand painted one."
592,this anime literally makes me cry every single week
593,god this was such a good episode
594,i will read the manga as soon as the ending credit scene rolls out next week. love this series now
595,I suggest you read from the start. The art is amazing.  And there is a certain scene that was skipped
596,Kohaku just called her dad a Boomer
597,"I'm really excited to see in what way will cellphone help them, and I'm even more excited to see Taiju and Yuzuriha again! This episode has been really fun with Gen's little song I really love Dr Stone's humor and the small little moments, like Senku high-fiving Chrome, Kaseki and Suika these scenes give me life.    Plus Kohaku's dad finally acknowledged Senku as a good village leader, that was sweet. And I love how Senku trusts Chrome enough to let him take over a side project, Kaseki too with the Hickman pump.    Man I'm gonna miss this show after next week."
598,Haven't watched this episode yet. But man I will miss this show. It gave me another reason to look forward to the weekends.
599,"That was fun. Finally, Senkuu and the Kingdom of Science has acquired the cellphone. I am going to miss this show when it ends, it really is entertaining. Surely there is a second season? I am out of the loop if one has been announced."
600,"I am really curious how this show will show that ""phone"" was the best invention to win this battle."
601,Can anyone explain why plastic was necessary? Couldn't have they used wooden crates as a casing for that complicated-looking device?
602,Plastic is non-conductive
603,"From wiki:    Wood is widely regarded as an extremely good insulator, but its resistivity is sensitively dependent on moisture content, with damp wood being a factor of at least 1010 worse insulator than oven-dry.In any case, a sufficiently high voltage – such as that in lightning strikes or some high-tension power lines – can lead to insulation breakdown and electrocution risk even with apparently dry wood."
604,"After next week I’m probably gonna have to open up an old science book on Fridays, but it won’t feel the same...."
605,"Anyone know which song was used during the bro moment with Kaseki, Chrome and Senku?"
606,I think it would be good to say that the focusing lens actually did nothing because the glass refracted the light a second time
607,"It shouldn't. The glass container would have some curve to it, but not as much power as the lens. It might reduce the strength a little, but not enough to kill it. The lens did help, it just wasn't enough given the little light. They might have been able to make a ""solar furnace"" though, an array of lenses and mirrors that would focus a lot of light from multiple directions onto a single point. That would work really well in this case, because each beam passing through the bottle would be relatively weak, and only where they met up in the center would it get super hot."
608,This just hit me. Is Senku the singer for the ED?   If so then that makes it sadder :
609,"OHAIYOUUU SEKAIII, they brought it back! That was hype as fuck man    Gen, when the album dropping bro?     ;    It's been a looooong journey since this anime was announced back in like May and I kept asking everyone on the CR facebook what it was about and if it was good, really glad I started reading it and got into it, def one of the most unique series I've seen and I'll be sad to see it end next week, hopefully a s2 will come soon, well onto Fire Force."
610,I've come to depend on this show for a weekly dose of good feelings. I really don't know what I'm going to do after next week.
611,"Besides needing to make a second unit, how would they ever get that second unit to T&Y?  That would take a significant fraction of the work to do a stealth assault. And the unit we saw didn’t seem that portable. And it’s not like Tsukasa and Hyoga would let T&Y be in a position to gather and report intelligence in the first place."
612,"Big one is probably a repeater. Smaller field units likely won't be able to pick up each others' signals, so this big on picks them up and retransmits them stronger."
613,I take it this season isn't going to have a great ending. Seems like we won't have senku vs shishio team. We'll just have to hope a S2 happens or this will just never happen in the anime.
614,"It won't have a  conclusive  ending, but I think the ending will be satisfying."
615,Gen's song remind me a lot of Pikotaro songs
616,Kohaku and the gorilla joke reminds me of the Love Pillar from demon slayer. The love pillars body type is almost completely equal to Kohakus i feel
617,Honestly gen stole the spotlight for this ep like everyone played a part but his song was the most memorable i even uploaded the song so damn catchy lmaoo
618,I’ve held on and haven’t read the promised neverland but Dr. Stone is so wholesome it’s gonna be hard not to read after the last episode.
619,This episode was so wholesome.
620,Can’t wait to see how this all goes down!
621,Hhh I finished my Dr. Stone marathon. Senku's laugh is beautiful. Gen best boy. I like how the anime uses gaming terms! I wanna read the manga right now but I will wait until the anime finishes.    YAYY FIRST OPENING INSERT!
622,You mean best Girl
623,Really going to miss this show
624,Man this is such a good episode! That opening song montage was a really nice touch as well. I just know season 2 will get announced soon.
625,"Gen’s song was very cringe worthy, but I still kind of liked it lol.    This episode weirdly gave me a slice of life vibe, which was a nice change of pace. I seriously have been loving this current arc.    I’m excited to see the phones in use next episode. Everyone’s reactions are going to be great!"
626,"I'm starting to feel like it was probably a mistake not to mass produce rifles.  currently the village has 40 people over half of whom are woman, children, and elderly.  In total they can probably field 10-15 people.  The enemy will likely come at them with 100-150 soldiers.  With rifles they could have armed the none combatants bringing their numbers to 40.  There is also the issue of thick tree coverage and the fact that the enemy doesn't need to split up it's forces. I can only see this working out if Senku wants to use this to pass propaganda into the enemy camp."
627,"they don't have gunpowder, Senku used the little he had left to bluff Hyoga"
628,"Unless the enemy side is occupying the spot were Senku was mining the sulfer, it shouldn't be a problem."
629,You need the stuff secreted by the bat's crap to make gunpowder If I recall correctly    Only known source is guarded by tuskasa.
630,They still lack sufficient nitric acid.
631,Actually you can make it using Calcium Nitrate and Sulfuric Acid.
632,Sure! If you have some calcium nitrate.
633,They don't have enough iron
634,"The others are right that they simply don't have the materials to make guns, and more importantly ammunition. But beyond that, swords and communications is far more powerful than guns with no communications.    Senku's group has the ability to clandetinely locate Tsukasa's forces, track them, and radio home with that information. Any intel Tsukasa's scouts acquire has to either be run back, or broadcasted back in a fashion that reveals their location to Senku's side smoke signals, yelling, horns, etc. If Senku's group can locate and eliminate those scouts before they report back, Tsukasa is rendered blind. Even without that, his information travels at a snail's pace compared to Senku's. Imagine trying to play an RTS where everything was fog of war, and you only got map and unit updates--including for your own units--at the rate your units could run back and forth, but your enemy got to see the usual display    As a result, Senku's group has complete control over when and where the battle will take place, and the ability to break up into much smaller groups while maintaining total coordination.     And the villagers are probably more capable warriors than we've seen. We've seen their specialists Kinro, Ginro, Magma, Kohaku, but very likely most of them can toss a spear or something. That combined with absolute battlefield control will win the day."
635,"unfortunately I disagree with pretty much everything you said.      - the materials are more feasible to acquire then say, finding tungsten laying on the ground.    - radios are great in large scale combat but not when you only have 5-10 people.  You also seem to under the impression that this is a two way transmitter which it's not. It's only use would be to put it at a high elevation but like I said were talking about a stone world were there are no pastures of fields just thick forests.      - it doesn't really mater how capable you are if your surrounded by 10 people with spears."
636,"the anime is titled ""Dr.Stone"" not ""Murder.Stone"""
637,Try telling that to these guys.
638,Rifles wouldn't be too much use without gunpowder.
639,"Is it realistic uh, geologically to walk into a cave and find a basketfull of tungsten?"
640,"Unlikely, not impossible. Skarns like the one shown do sometimes contain tungsten, and  could  form just about anywhere that has or had volcanic activity."
641,"Such a great episode, so sad there’s only one more left for a while at least"
642,Gorilla team so OP they can cook up 1500+ degrees
643,The speedrun of preparation with first opening in background was truly remarkable idea
644,"Extremely wholesome episode, everyone helped out and did their best for the phone tower."
645,"This might actually be the last episode, if the next one turns out to be a recap."
646,from the title next episode. I assure you it aint a recap
647,The mad lads did it
648,I really doubt we'll see the big fight next episode.
649,I have no idea how they're going to finish off this season without the final battle.     There's still so much to cover.
650,"so wholesome, why must you end?"
651,"They could have made plastic from milk and vinegar, but maybe that kind of plastic is no good for their scenario"
652,Where would they get milk in a way appropiate for a shonen manga?
653,Oh
654,Off-screen Ruri
655,Can't watch because our  WiFi is broke
656,Build a new one.
657,Underrated comment
658,"The old couple mentioned people dying in the winter. It’s the first winter for everyone on Team Tsukasa, except for Taiju. How many of them made it?"
659,"Yeah, maybe not 100%, although they would all be healthy young adults, when most people that would die from a bad winter would be old, very young, or otherwise sickly."
660,"Spent the last 2 days catching up just in time for the finale. Old man kaseki touched me this episode, he's a real hero of the town and he just wanted people he could call a buddy"
661,Can someone please explain wtf gen’s song was? And wtf was he doing making rice balls? This was the first time in the show I didn’t understand what was happening
662,"Why didnt he just make a couple of cups and some string, way easier than that monstrosity."
663,"Why didn't they just make guns to fight with, or is it to difficult."
664,1. Cant make gunpowder 2.Dr.Stone not Kill.Stone
